Thanks everybody for joining us for our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. I'd like to kind of start out this call as my first call with some opening remarks about how I see our business and our strategies and then I'm going to turn it over to Pat and Bruce to provide a bit of additional color on our DIRECTV businesses in both the U.S. and Latin America.First of all, let me say how truly excited I am to be CEO of this great company, DIRECTV. I've now been on the job officially for a bit about a month and a half but actually unofficially, a bit more than that. And I've already had a chance to get a much better appreciation for why DIRECTV has performed so well as a company over the past several years. To simply put in my mind, it's about a terrific product and brand and a talented team of people. We had an excellent management meeting of our top 150 executives earlier in January where I had the chance to get a first-hand look and meet all of our people, seeing the capabilities, the passion, the expertise and the will to win the DIRECTV leaders have. I've also had a chance to quickly see that DIRECTV truly has advantage technology. It has distinctive content, I'd like to say done with a twist. It has industry-leading customer service to provide a great customer experience and needless to say, I think the best brand in the business.And of course, it doesn't hurt that we also consistently generate prodigious amounts of cash, have a strong balance sheet and have demonstrated the discipline to return that cash to our shareholders. With that kind of a foundation, I'm confident that we have an extremely bright future ahead of us. Now before talking about our priorities and our outlook for 2010, let me just quickly recap full year 2009, a year that I think was an extremely strong year for both our U.S. and Latin America businesses, as frankly, no thanks to me, but thanks to the leadership of Chase Carey, Larry Hunter and the entire DIRECTV management team.In our U.S. business, despite an increasingly competitive industry, we still ended up the year adding the most net subscribers in four years. We've also managed to grow our pre-SAC margin by over 100 basis points and drove our CapEx down about 15%, while also significantly improving our call center and installer networks performance.Once again, last year, we had the highest customer service rating in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, and we outperformed all of our major competitors for the ninth consecutive year. In Latin America, Bruce and his team had an absolutely terrific year. Our performance was even more impressive as we established new records for virtually every key financial metrics from gross adds, to net adds, to revenues, to profits before depreciation and amortization. All of these achievements drove industry-leading results at the consolidated DIRECTV level, including as you saw in our release, nearly 10% revenue growth for the full year and 40% free cash flow growth. On top of all that, we repurchased another $1.7 billion of stock, bringing the total buybacks to about $10 billion over the past four years while reducing our shares outstanding by over a third. So with that as backdrop, I think it's fair to say that we head into 2010 with solid momentum and some real areas of strength across our business.Let me just briefly touch on how I see the external environment that we face going forward. You won't be surprised that I believe the economic recovery in the U.S. continues to be quite fragile. Consumers are still very cautious about spending money, and they're very focused on getting good value for their money. On the other hand, in Latin America and most especially in Brazil, the macroeconomic environment is quite a bit more buoyant. Second, our industry, the pay television industry in the United States, is certainly in the process of maturing and I would say is increasingly competitive. While the industry in Latin America, I think, continues to offer opportunities for us to increase our penetration levels and supports strong overall growth prospects.  Furthermore, on the cost side, programming expenses in general in our industry are increasing at a faster rate than overall CPI. The good news with all that said is that consumers remain passionate about watching video, both inside and outside their homes, and video is the fastest-growing service on the Internet, as well as on mobile phones and other portable devices. As DIRECTV's new CEO, my goal is to continue to build on our successful track record of agility and resilience, taking us to even higher levels of market share, revenue profits and cash flow. To do that, there are a few things that we've been doing that we won't change but we'll continue to emphasize going forward. And let me touch on those. First, we intend to continue to lead our industry by introducing innovative new products and services. For instance, later this year, we'll allow our customers to fully connect all the media devices in their homes. Second, we'll continue to build the strength of our DIRECTV brand through innovative advertising and marketing campaigns designed to attract high-quality subscribers. Now as an aside, aggressive marketing, coupled with competitive pricing and  discounting has certainly become a more important part of our overall industry's marketing strategies. I frankly don't see that changing anytime soon. And for our part, we in DIRECTV will remain competitive by responding appropriately while also keeping a sharp eye on quality. Next, we remain committed to delivering the industry's best customer service, providing a world-class customer experience each and every time. And finally, we'll continue to manage our cost with discipline to support margin expansion.Now with all of that said, our industry is rapidly changing. The economic and consumer environment is changing and it's important that we change, too, and evolve our strategic and operational priorities in that regard. Now I should say we've kicked off a major effort here at DIRECTV to conduct a comprehensive review of all of our strategies, and we expect to complete that review later this spring. And I look forward to sharing the results of our work with you all later this year. But from my initial observations and from the way we've structured some of that work, I think you should expect to see some shift in emphasis in a couple of key areas in our 2010 strategies and plans. Let me just touch on those areas, and I really am just going to highlight three areas that I would focus on. First, our vision at DIRECTV has been to provide the absolute best television experience to our customers. That's still critical. But I think it's fair to say that increasingly, our consumers expect us to be even more of a full video provider, and they also expect to access that content whenever and wherever they want to. As a result in 2010, DIRECTV will make it even easier for our customers to record their favorite shows and access that program from any television in their home with a single whole home DVR that will also connect with other media devices.We'll create ways for our customers to take that same programming with them on the go, including the ability to watch their favorite team live on their mobile phone. Later this year, we'll be launching the industry's first 3D channel lineup, offering the latest 3D movie releases and sporting events like Major League Baseball All-Star game and helped lead the development of future 3D content as well. We'll continue to connect more of our customers to the Internet so that they can watch home movies, share photos with friends and even watch YouTube. And finally, we'll introduce DIRECTV CINEMA later this spring, an exciting new movie service where our customers will watch the latest box office hits with a simple click of their remote rather than waiting days or even weeks to get those same movies by mail.In doing that, we'll immediately expand our pay-per-view offerings to nearly 400 titles of the hottest movies versus only about 15 titles to date. And about half of those movies will be ready to watch at the same time, they become available on DVD. Simply put, overall, we intend to continue to create innovative products and services that lead our industry and create loyal customers for life. Second, there's nothing more important to me than keeping our 18 million customers plus passionate about our DIRECTV service and earn their loyalty on a daily basis. Now I understand that's not an easy task. We take over 130 million phone calls a year for instance, and I don't take it lightly. Although DIRECTV generally ranks at the top of our industry on customer satisfaction and we've made tremendous progress over the last year, I think there's still more to do, and we need to take our game to an even higher level. Frankly, it still amazes me that pay TV providers as a group continue to rank at the bottom of the ASCI survey year after year. Somehow, we must and will crack the code upon the challenge of providing world-class customer experience every day.Now undoubtedly achieving higher service levels is going to involve perhaps changes in policies and practices, maybe some new sales and marketing tactics and perhaps even further investments in the homes of our customers. But over time, I believe that the financial returns will be fully realized if we have the most loyal happiest customers in the industry. In fact, I would argue that managing churn or as I'd like to say, turning it upside down and talking about increasing loyalty is quickly becoming our greatest value driver and perhaps our most important priority as our company and industry mature. Third and finally, we'll carefully be reviewing our overall corporate and business development strategies. Let me just touch on a couple, starting with Latin America and international. I personally believe we have tremendous international growth opportunities ahead of us. First, we intend to fully leverage our strengths in Latin America and continue to drive strong growth in our businesses there, while at the same time, taking the chance to selectively assess opportunities outside of Latin America, particularly emerging markets. Now I understand that there has been some debate about the pros and cons of spitting DIRECTV Latin America off into a separate company. And although I've not drawn any final conclusions, certainly my initial thoughts are very similar to those you've heard expressed publicly by both Pat and Bruce, namely that I believe DIRECTV Latin America gain substantial and tangible operational, financial and competitive synergies by being a part of DIRECTV. I think those benefits should be quite apparent, particularly when you hear Bruce's comments later about their very significant leadership position in both HD and DVR services throughout the region. And I think it's also fair to say Bruce would point out, I think there's some things we could learn here in the U.S. from the success that we've had in Latin America. Second I believe Latin America still has significant growth potential, as well as value creation potential that we've yet to fully exploit on behalf of our shareholders.Now another question that I'm often asked is whether or not we're interested in buying content. Let me be clear, I don't see this as a primary focus for us. But I would say, my answer is pretty much the same probably as you've heard in the past from Chase. We will continue to opportunistically pursue what I'd call tucked under content deals that are neither overpriced and are deals where we could provide specific tangible value or synergies. One example where I could imagine that and where we certainly I think have some unique value is in sports. To state the obvious, sports is DIRECTV's greatest programming strength. And as such, it represents in an area where we have the greatest opportunity, I think, to create value. Now as part of the Liberty merger, we now own three regional sports networks, and I'm very excited about bringing DIRECTV's differentiated services to our fans in Seattle, Denver and Pittsburgh. Now we're also developing strategies to selectively gain DIRECTV market share those cities while also looking at other cities in the country for possible opportunities for expansion. In closing, let me just paraphrase John Malone when he introduced me as DIRECTV's new CEO of couple of months ago. John talked about the orchestra and the conductor, but from my standpoint, the great orchestra starts with having great musicians. I'm blessed to have those great musicians in our management team, as well as in our entire employee population. My job as the conductor of those great musicians is to continue to bring out the best in each and every one of them both as individuals, but most importantly, as a team. As someone who spent a lot of time in my career studying strategy and understanding competition and how to compete, I can assure you we will continue to win in the marketplace first and foremost while at the same time, consistently delivering strong, sustainable financial returns to our shareholders. We have an unbelievable set of assets here at DIRECTV, and I'm excited about our opportunity to make DIRECTV an even more fabulous service to our customers in the years ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill for a summary of DIRECTV Latin America's results and outlook. Bruce?"
29614,88670278,50617,"The DIRECTV Group, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mike. Well, as Mike said, overall, DIRECTV Latin America had one of its best quarters ever, highlighted by our record-setting subscribers growth throughout the region. Just as a quick reminder to everybody, all of the figures I'm about to d",1357,"Great. Thanks, Mike. Well, as Mike said, overall, DIRECTV Latin America had one of its best quarters ever, highlighted by our record-setting subscribers growth throughout the region. Just as a quick reminder to everybody, all of the figures I'm about to discuss exclude results for Sky Mexico, which we account for on an equity basis. However, it's important to note that Sky Mexico also had extremely strong subscriber growth in the quarter. Looking first at our growth additions, we achieved a new record in the quarter, growing 35% to $460,000 bringing our full year results to 1.58 million gross additions. What I'm particularly pleased about is that this growth occurred throughout the region. In addition to the strong results we're accustomed to seeing in countries like Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, we also experienced significant growth in other territories such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Chile. I think this speaks to the strength of our Pan-regional strategy. Furthermore, our growth is coming from both the higher end of the market, as well as from the Middle Market segments, which is becoming a more recent focus of our efforts. At the higher end, increasing sales of HD and DVR services are driving much of the growth. For example, sales of HD and DVR services to new customers are over twice the rate of a year ago and reached about 25% for all DTVLA's gross additions in the fourth quarter. Much of the increase sales are coming out of PanAmericana, where we're capitalizing on our DVR leadership position. But we're also seeing accelerated demand for HD services in Brazil. We launched our HD services there in the second quarter of last year, and we were already reaching double-digit penetration levels for new subscribers in Brazil. In Brazil, we have the most comprehensive HD offering in the country with about 30 channels, and we expect to further extend on our lead with the launch of new several channels this year, including additional HD programming from Global.With respect to our focus on the Middle Market segment, we've had success with both our prepaid offerings, as well as our lower priced postpaid packages. Prepaid gross adds compromise more than 25% of our total gross adds in the fourth quarter. Although most of our prepaid subscribers continue to come from Venezuela, we have begun to gain traction in other territories, such as Puerto Rico and Columbia. And a prepaid product is an important component of the sales increase in those territories that I referred to earlier. And in Brazil, our growth has been fueled by the recently launched Sky Digital Light package, which is a postpaid package targeted at the middle market.Turning now to churn, this is another area where we saw favorable trends in the quarter, as our average monthly churn rate declined five basis points to 1.54%. This improvement was mostly due to a nine basis point reduction in postpaid churn to 1.45% in the quarter, which represented the lowest postpaid churn level for us in over two years, well-below the 1.5% sweet spot that many of you have heard me talk about in the past for postpaid customers. Although Q4 has typically been a strong quarter for us in terms of churn, I do believe that much of this improvement reflects the increased penetration of HD and Standard Def [Definition] DVR services discussed earlier, as well as our use of more focus to upgrade and retention strategies. We're also seeing our prepaid churn levels have stabilize as this subscriber base matures, and we continue to refine our recharged strategies.I think it's also worth noting that our strong results for both closes and churn are favorably impacted by the relatively stable macroeconomic and financial conditions that we are currently seeing across most of the region. The combination of higher growth additions and lower churn drove a 59% increase in net additions to a record 254,000 in the quarter, bringing our DTVLA subscriber base to almost 4.6 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 18%. And if you include Sky Mexico, we now have over 6.5 million subscribers throughout Latin America.Looking now in our financials, DTVLA's revenues, earnings and cash flow were all solid in the quarter, particularly considering the higher cash repatriation charges in Venezuela. Revenues of $839 million were up 47%, driven by both strong subscriber and ARPU growth. Excluding the favorable FX impact coming primarily out of Brazil, revenues would've increased by around 35%. ARPU of about $63 in the fourth quarter grew 25% and reflected a favorable FX impact of about $5, again driven primarily by exchange rates in Brazil. Excluding the FX impact, the DTVLA's ARPU would've increased about 16% in the quarter reflecting both price increases and higher penetration of advanced products. Operating profits before depreciation and amortization increased 20% in the quarter to $219 million and includes a $45 million charge related to the exchange of Venezuelan currency for U.S. dollars, as we continue to repatriate cash from Venezuela. There were no comparable charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, we incurred $213 million in charges from repatriating cash from Venezuela, compared with only $29 million in 2008. Cash flow before interest and taxes, including these FX charges, was down a bit in the quarter as the increase in OPBDA was more than offset by higher subscriber-related CapEx reflecting the significant increase in gross adds and sales of advanced products.I'd like to conclude with a few comments about our 2010 outlook. Beginning with subscribers, we're looking for another great year with net adds at or above the record of 2009. This bullish outlook assumes that the overall economic and financial conditions remained generally stable and the strong trend seen last year continue in terms of increasing sales of HD, DVR and prepaid services. We're also anticipating strong demand for our differentiated and oftentimes exclusive coverage of the FIFA World Cup in the middle of the year. We will have about six hours of original programming each day. And in all countries except Brazil, we will be the only provider in Latin America showing all of the games live in high definition.Revenue growth this year is likely to be roughly half of last year's growth reflecting the effects of a devaluation in Venezuela. Otherwise, we would've expected about the same growth as last year. The two segments have been receiving a number of questions about the impact of this devaluation, I thought it would be helpful to provide a bit of color on this subject. As many of you know probably know, in January, the Venezuelan government announced that the official exchange rate for the Bolivar would go from 2.15 to 4.23 bolivars to the dollar. In other words, relative to 2009, Venezuelan revenues and ARPU will be reduced by about 50% when translated into dollars. From and OPBDA the perspective, however, were not expecting any significant impact from the devaluation because we have already been withdrawing excess Bolivars from Venezuela throughout the year at the even more unfavorable parallel rates, which has had the effect of depressing our OPBDA. In short, DTVLA's reported 2009 OPBDA of $697 million already has the Venezuelan devaluation baked in. Also keep in mind, most of the cost associated with the Venezuelan business, including programming, are denominated in the local currency. So at the consolidated DTVLA level, even with the rapid subscriber growth and the full year effect of the Venezuelan devaluation, we are targeting a very strong year in terms of OPBDA as we expect higher margins and subscriber growth to generate OPBDA growth of more than 20% in 2010 compared with 2009. However, cash flow before interest and taxes is likely to be modestly down, primarily because we're expecting an increase in CapEx, mostly due to the higher gross adds and increased sales of advanced products.So in wrapping things up, I hope you can see by my comments, we remain extremely bullish on our growth prospects in Latin America, and we look forward to an even better year in 2010. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat to discuss DIRECTV U.S. Pat?"
29614,88670278,50617,"The DIRECTV Group, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought DIRECTV U.S. had a very solid quarter highlighted by industry-leading revenue growth, higher margins largely gained through operational improvements and substantial free cash flow growth. The one area that fell below expe",1870,"Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought DIRECTV U.S. had a very solid quarter highlighted by industry-leading revenue growth, higher margins largely gained through operational improvements and substantial free cash flow growth. The one area that fell below expectations was subscriber growth, which I'll talk about in a minute. Looking first at the top line, DIRECTV U.S. revenue growth was solid at 8%. Although ARPU growth of 2.1% was flat with the third quarter's rate, we're actually quite pleased with the results because we saw several favorable trends that should carry into 2010. At the top of the list were premium channels or buyer rates in the fourth quarter declined at the slowest rates of the year, pay-per-view movie revenues were also solid and grew at the fastest rate of the year. The same holds true for advertising revenues, which were up about 13% over last year and represented our best quarter ever for ad sales. NFL Sunday Ticket revenues also were very strong and exceeded our expectations. So with these favorable trends, we remain confident that ARPU growth in 2010 will be greater than the level attained in 2009. Although net additions of 119,000 fell below our expectations, there were actually several positive trends in the quarter related to the quality of new subscribers and take rates for HD and DVR services. The decline in growth additions was mostly due to stricter credit policies and a more competitive environment.During the second half of the year, we implemented several policy changes aimed at further improving the profitability of new subscribers. For example, we raised the minimum credit score required for new customers to receive our national offers. We required credit cards on our commercial and MDU channels. We improved the profitability of the DIRECTV mass [ph] packages. And we dropped dealers that did not meet our quality standards. All of these measures impact growth additions however, we believe that over the long-term, subscriber returns will be greater due to the resulting lower churn and higher margins.But as I've mentioned, the overall quality of new subscribers remained high, both in terms of credit scores and sales of advanced services. For example, we reached a record high for HD and DVR sales as nearly 70% of new subscribers signed up for these services. By comparison, we added about 50% more HD and DVR customers than our largest competitor last year. As a result, we ended the year with an advanced services penetration rate of around 60% of our total subscriber base.Turning now to churn, I thought that the 1.52% in the quarter and the increase over the last year were consistent with our previously stated goal, striking at a better economic balance between our churn rate and the dollars spent to retain customers. As we discussed on the last call, we regularly update our offers for existing customers to reflect the more challenging economic and competitive landscape. In recent quarters, we've tightened up our offers by making them less attractive, particularly for lower quality subscribers. In some cases, these stricter policies result in higher cancellations, especially for the more price-sensitive customers who are shopping around for the cheapest deal. The return, however, is quite evident when you look at the more than 100 million or 23% reduction in our cash upgrade and spending expenses compared to last year's fourth quarter.Now looking out our cost and margins, I thought we did an excellent job managing cost in the quarter with the exception of SAC. As a result, DIRECTV U.S.'s OPBDA  margin increased 260 basis points to about 25% while OPBDA 21% to almost $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. About a half of the margin growth was due to the lower upgrade and retention cost that I talked about earlier. The next largest contributor was in programming, where we picked up a about a 60 basis point margin improvement over the prior year.  We've done a good job managing these calls all of year, leading to a full year programming costs increase of less than 2% per subscriber. Also in the fourth quarter, we benefited from booking profits on our existing NFL Sunday Ticket contract. You may recall it historically, we've booked our NFL Sunday Ticket revenues at zero margin. However, based on the greater than expected NFL revenues in the fourth quarter that I talked about earlier and the expectations of continued success this year, which by the way is the last year of the current contract, we started booking modest profits and expect to continue recognizing gains this year as well.Another area where we are seeing an important progress is in Subscriber Services. We've shared with you many of our targets and initiatives over the last couple of years. And it's encouraging that we're now starting to see the payoff. For example, fourth quarter service levels at our call centers were significantly better than a year ago and at a lower cost. Also our set-top box reliability is better, and we've implemented several technology advancements in the field aimed at improving efficiencies. And as a result, we've recently seen significant reductions in the number of truck rolls and service calls.The one area that did not meet expectations with SAC, which was greater than last year, primarily due to a higher marketing costs and investments in the home. As I mentioned earlier, we increased some of our offers for new customers to be more competitive. It's important to note that these offers were introduced in concert with our tighter credit policies to ensure that the quality of additions was not compromised. In addition, we're spending more money for advanced services and new technologies in the home. As an example, the percentage of new customers signing up for our HD DVR box, was 50% higher than a year ago while its receiver is roughly twice the cost of a standalone HD box. We also decided in Q4 to install our advanced SWM Dish, which stands for Single Wire Multi-Switch and all-new HD households. Although this new dish cost more than a standard dish, we believe this is an important investment to make as we strive to future proof customers homes in anticipation of the many new services we're introducing in the coming months, including Multi-Room Viewing, new broadband applications and the Home Media Center.So with a solid top line growth, higher margins and a 35% decline in capital expenditures, cash flow before interest and taxes grew by 42% to just under $1 billion, which was by far the best quarter ever for DIRECTV U.S. And at a consolidated DIRECTV level, fourth quarter free cash flow, which includes DIRECTV Latin America, taxes and interests, grow even faster at 64% to $710 million. These strong results contributed to a full year free cash flow growth of 40% to a record $2.36 billion in 2009.In terms of our consolidated balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $2.6 million of cash and about $8 billion of total debt. The debt balance at year end includes the Bank of America debt assumed at the completions of the Liberty transaction in November of last year. At year end, that balance was about $1.2 billion. And since then, we have continued to pay down the BofA debt and related equity collars and expect to be finished with that process later this month.Also in the quarter, we booked $29 million in revenues and $12 million in OPBDA for our three new regional sports networks. These results are included in our Sports Networks, Eliminations and other segment. We're very excited about owning the Pittsburgh, Rocky Mountain and North West RSNs [Regional Sports Network] and welcome them to the DIRECTV family. Before turning the call back over to John, I'd like to provide our 2010 outlook for both DIRECTV U.S. and for the consolidated company. Starting at the top line for DIRECTV U.S., we're targeting revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range, which is very similar to last year's level. Relative to 2009, we're expecting less contribution from our subscriber growth. But as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting faster ARPU growth in 2010 compared to 2009. We're also looking for an increase in OPBDA margin, which is expected to help drive OPBDA growth in the low teens range. Cash flow before interest and taxes growth is expected to be a bit higher in the mid-teens range as we target another year-over-year decline and set-top box CapEx. For non-set-top box CapEx, it's likely to remain in the $500 million to $600 million range we have seen in the past. At the consolidated company level, cash flow before interest and taxes expected to be strong and consistent with the DIRECTV U.S. performance. However, cash taxes are expected to increase quite a bit in 2010 due to our higher profit levels and the cessation of the benefits gained over the past couple of years from the accelerated depreciation associated with the two economic stimulus programs in the U.S. In addition, we're anticipating greater interest expense as we increase our leverage. As a result, free cash flow, which I'll remind you grew at a faster than expected rate last year of 40%, is likely to be in the mid single-digit range. EPS is expected to more than double to over $2. Excluding the nearly $500 million charge in 2009 related to the Liberty transactions, we're targeting EPS growth of some 50% driven by the OPBDA growth, lower depreciation and amortization expenses and a continued decline in shares outstanding due to buybacks.And finally, a few words about our return to capital strategy in the balance sheet, which I know our topics of great interest to many of you. First, as you saw in our press release this morning, we announced a new share repurchase program of $3.5 billion. We still believe that our stock is undervalued, and as such, we will continue repurchasing our stock in the same aggressive, but opportunistic fashion you've seen from us over the past few years. We expect to begin repurchasing shares soon once the equity colors have been fully unwound. Regarding our total debt to OPBDA target, at this time, we do not have a specific timeline for achieving that target. Many of you know the difficulty in predicting when and if we hit that target, particularly considering the uncertainty of the financial markets combined with our low net debt and rapidly growing OPBDA. Indeed, a problem most companies could only hope for. Having said that, we will carefully review our longer-term capital structure with our Board as part of our overall strategy efforts this spring. We will share any further thoughts on that once our board has had a chance to review our thinking and approve a longer-term capital structure. So in summary, as we head into this new year, we feel real good about our operating and financial strengths, and look forward to further extending our video leadership position with the many new and exciting products we'll be launching later this year. And with these strengths, we're targeting yet another year in which we lead the industry in both top line and bottom line growth as well as returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jon."

Going back to some of your prepared remarks, you talked about your long-term view on DIRECTV. And over the years, DIRECTV has shifted its strategy between market share, growth and top line investment mode to harvest free cash flow. And I think there's always been a balance there as you look at whether you're putting money to work or focusing on near-term earnings, which as you know, in the short-term, are actually inversely correlated. How are you thinking about that balance when you look at the business today, you mentioned the competitive landscape and the maturing business model, but you also talk about product investments, et cetera and opportunities to do more than you already doing in terms of product delivery. So maybe you could just spend a few minutes for us taking about how you're look at the business from a balance of top line growth versus free cash and earnings?"

We also started in February of last year with AT&T. But both of those gave us a significant bulk in the number of adds that we've got in the first half of last year that frankly, I don't expect us to see repeating this year. So I think there are some unique things that we need to take into consideration, and how we strike the balance. And to your point exactly, Ben, I think a business is interconnected is this, it is about finding the right equilibrium. And as a business matures, in my mind, as I said in the call, I'm frankly more interested in how we create passionate loyalty out of our consumers for life than necessarily chasing lower quality subs. But having said all of that, we need to stay competitive. And I'm used to kind of whether they're Map-of-Wars or whether they're Cola Wars, and we intend to be fully competitive. But I think it is a balance to your point exactly. And I would say we recognized that the industry has gotten a bit more competitive in the last six months and we are fine tuning our own strategies accordingly. But at the same time, I think DIRECTV has been very good about trying to consciously manage and strike the appropriate balance between the discipline with which we managed our ARPU, our SAC and our costs to ensure we continue to deliver strong cash flow to our shareholders. I guess my view is I think it's a bit of both, unfortunately. We got to both be competitive, but at the same time, I think, it doesn't do anybody any good to chase poor quality subs. And I think it's that delicate balance, if you will, that we will continue to strike as we head into this year."

I'm not sure you can kind of manage it any tighter than that. I think though, over all, our view historically, and mine still is -- 1.5% churn is probably a normative level and you may find a quarter will be a little bit above that and a quarter will be a little bit below that. But to me, my point about churn is that I want to shift our mindset to looking at what do we need to do to make it, so nobody ever wants to leave the franchise. Now that's an aspirational goal. But as I said, from a financial standpoint, I think 1.5% is probably about the sweet spot for us on churn. But I do think that the whole area of continuing to look to create even greater passion and loyalty in our customers is really got to be the area of focus as an industry matures. And suffice it to say, I think this is a reasonably mature industry."

Using our SWM technology, which we think is a great decision in the quarter that had some affect on it. We did match the competitors a little bit. I shouldn't say match, I mean we came in with a cash back offer. So there were some things in the fourth quarter that might have been unique. But like Mike said, what we see going forward is we are going to make some investments in the Home in 2010. And whether it's Multi-Room Viewing, it's a higher percentage of broadband, connectivity later in the year, Home Media Center, we obviously have the full effect in the year of using the SWM on all of our HD installs. All of those, we think are kind of must investments in the Home. And that we'll, as Mike said it, first of all, make for a better experience for the customer, on a secured customer and plus they're all revenue opportunities. So kind of looking at the fourth quarter, there was certain things that drove the rate to what it is. But going forward, we will be investing a little bit more in the Home.

On the satellite launch, we don't have any satellites after our D12, which is already launched.

But I think certainly, it's our job as management is to provide more transparency and more clarity to the Street about our strategy, about our potential, about the scale, about what we can do with that business. And I think we've ramped up Bruce's exposure over the last year and we intend to do it even more of that in the years ahead. So I think it's partly being able to articulate a clear strategy and to be clear with the Street about what our expectations are in terms of cash, in terms of Latin America. I frankly, the math I've seen and I've looked at it with a couple of anchors, I'm also not yet sold that if you try and split off or spin off a business that has two joint ventures in the middle of it, one in Brazil and one in Mexico, that I'm going to create more shareholder value that way. I'd be pretty surprised, frankly, from my experience in looking at that issue. But I would say, first and foremost, this is a business that's just blossoming right now. And to me, we've got significant value creation potential over the next few years. I'll never say never on anything. I think we'll always look at what's in our shareholders best interest. But if I look at it today, at least my initial reaction is that I think there's a lot of value creation. And I think it's up to us to do a better job of explaining to you all how we're going to realize that value, and what our strategies are to deliver it. On the second question on being a subscriber, yes, when John Malone first interviewed me, I happened to be a subscriber in Connecticut and so I'm a very happy subscriber. I was very familiar with the product and frankly, as someone out of the Consumer business, when I first took this job, I think there were three things that I looked at. One, is it a great product, two is it a great brand and three is what's the culture of the team of people you're going to work with. And in all of three of those fronts as I did my due diligence, I was very, very enthusiastic about this company that I was joining. And so I think our user interface is better than anybody else's. I think that once you've seen high-def, you'd never go back to standard-def. I think the sports offerings that we have are second to none. And I also think that more than anybody else, we don't just aggregate content. We do what I call distinctive content with a twist. Eric Shanks and his team, I think are always thinking creatively about what else we can do there. I think we're certainly, from my experience, the best marketer of multiple channel video our there. And I think there's still lots more opportunities for us to innovate with our product down the road. Pat, you want to try the tax question?"

Thanks everybody for joining us for our Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. I'd like to kind of start out this call as my first call with some opening remarks about how I see our business and our strategies and then I'm going to turn it over to Pat and Bruce to provide a bit of additional color on our DIRECTV businesses in both the U.S. and Latin America.First of all, let me say how truly excited I am to be CEO of this great company, DIRECTV. I've now been on the job officially for a bit about a month and a half but actually unofficially, a bit more than that. And I've already had a chance to get a much better appreciation for why DIRECTV has performed so well as a company over the past several years. To simply put, in my mind, it's about a terrific product and brand and a talented team of people. We had an excellent management meeting of our top 150 executives earlier in January where I had the chance to get a first-hand look and meet all of our people, seeing the capabilities, the passion, the expertise and the will to win the DIRECTV leaders have. I've also had a chance to quickly see that DIRECTV truly has advantage technology. It has distinctive content, I'd like to say, done with a twist. It has industry-leading customer service to provide a great customer experience and needless to say, I think the best brand in the business.And of course, it doesn't hurt that we also consistently generate prodigious amounts of cash, have a strong balance sheet and have demonstrated the discipline to return that cash to our shareholders. With that kind of a foundation, I'm confident that we have an extremely bright future ahead of us. Now before talking about our priorities and our outlook for 2010, let me just quickly recap full year 2009, a year that I think was an extremely strong year for both our U.S. and Latin America businesses, as frankly, no thanks to me, but thanks to the leadership of Chase Carey, Larry Hunter and the entire DIRECTV management team.In our U.S. business, despite an increasingly-competitive industry, we still ended up the year adding the most net subscribers in four years. We've also managed to grow our Pre-SAC margin by over 100 basis points and drove our CapEx down about 15%, while also significantly improving our call center and installer networks performance.Once again, last year, we had the highest customer service rating in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, and we outperformed all of our major competitors for the ninth consecutive year. In Latin America, Bruce and his team had an absolutely terrific year. Our performance was even more impressive as we establish new records for virtually every key financial metrics from gross adds, to net adds, to revenues, to profits before depreciation and amortization. All of these achievements drove industry-leading results at the consolidated DIRECTV level, including as you saw in our release, nearly 10% revenue growth for the full year and 40% free cash flow growth. On top of all that, we repurchased another $1.7 billion of stock, bringing the total buybacks to about $10 billion over the past four years while reducing our shares outstanding by over a third. So with that as backdrop, I think it's fair to say that we head into 2010 with solid momentum and some real areas of strength across our business.Let me just briefly touch on how I see the external environment that we face going forward. You won't be surprised that I believe the economic recovery in the U.S. continues to be quite fragile. Consumers are still very cautious about spending money, and they're very focused on getting good value for their money. On the other hand, in Latin America and most especially in Brazil, the macroeconomic environment is quite a bit more buoyant. Second, our industry, the pay television industry in the United States, is certainly in the process of maturing and I would say is increasingly competitive. While the industry in Latin America, I think, continues to offer opportunities for us to increase our penetration levels and support strong overall growth prospects.  Furthermore, on the cost side, programming expenses in general in our industry are increasing at a faster rate than overall CPI. The good news with all that said is that consumers remain passionate about watching video, both inside and outside their homes, and video is the fastest-growing service on the Internet, as well as on mobile phones and other portable devices. As DIRECTV's new CEO, my goal is to continue to build on our successful track record of agility and resilience, taking us to even higher levels of market share, revenue profits and cash flow. To do that, there are a few things that we've been doing that we won't change but we'll continue to emphasize going forward. And let me touch on those. First, we intend to continue to lead our industry by introducing innovative new products and services. For instance, later this year, we'll allow our customers to fully connect all the media devices in their homes. Second, we'll continue to build the strength of our DIRECTV brand through innovative advertising and marketing campaigns designed to attract high-quality subscribers. Now as an aside, aggressive marketing, coupled with competitive pricing and discounting has certainly become a more important part of our overall industry's marketing strategies. I, frankly, don't see that changing anytime soon. And for our part, we in DIRECTV will remain competitive by responding appropriately while also keeping a sharp eye on quality. Next, we remain committed to delivering the industry's best customer service, providing a world-class customer experience each and every time. And finally, we'll continue to manage our cost with discipline to support margin expansion.Now with all of that said, our industry is rapidly changing. The economic and consumer environment is changing and it's important that we change, too, and evolve our strategic and operational priorities in that regard. Now I should say we've kicked off a major effort here at DIRECTV to conduct a comprehensive review of all of our strategies, and we expect to complete that review later this spring. And I look forward to sharing the results of our work with you all later this year. But from my initial observations and from the way we've structured some of that work, I think you should expect to see some shift in emphasis in a couple of key areas in our 2010 strategies and plans. Let me just touch on those areas, and I really am just going to highlight three areas that I would focus on. First, our vision at DIRECTV has been to provide the absolute best television experience to our customers. That's still critical. But I think it's fair to say that increasingly, our consumers expect us to be even more of a full video provider, and they also expect to access that content whenever and wherever they want to. As a result in 2010, DIRECTV will make it even easier for our customers to record their favorite shows and access that program from any television in their home with a single whole home DVR that will also connect with other media devices.We'll create ways for our customers to take that same programming with them on the go, including the ability to watch their favorite team live on their mobile phone. Later this year, we'll be launching the industry's first 3D channel lineup, offering the latest 3D movie releases and sporting events like Major League Baseball All-Star game and helped lead the development of future 3D content as well. We'll continue to connect more of our customers to the Internet so that they can watch home movies, share photos with friends and even watch YouTube. And finally, we'll introduce DIRECTV CINEMA later this spring, an exciting new movie service where our customers will watch the latest box office hits with a simple click of their remote rather than waiting days or even weeks to get those same movies by mail.In doing that, we'll immediately expand our pay-per-view offerings to nearly 400 titles of the hottest movies versus only about 15 titles to date. And about half of those movies will be ready to watch at the same time, they become available on DVD. Simply put, overall, we intend to continue to create innovative products and services that lead our industry and create loyal customers for life. Second, there's nothing more important to me than keeping our 18 million customers plus passionate about our DIRECTV service and earn their loyalty on a daily basis. Now I understand that's not an easy task. We take over 130 million phone calls a year for instance, and I don't take it lightly. Although DIRECTV generally ranks at the top of our industry on customer satisfaction and we've made tremendous progress over the last year, I think there's still more to do, and we need to take our game to an even higher level. Frankly, it still amazes me that pay TV providers as a group continue to rank at the bottom of the ASCI survey year after year. Somehow, we must and will crack the code upon the challenge of providing world-class customer experience every day.Now undoubtedly achieving higher service levels is going to involve perhaps changes in policies and practices, maybe some new sales and marketing tactics and perhaps even further investments in the homes of our customers. But over time, I believe that the financial returns will be fully realized if we have the most loyal happiest customers in the industry. In fact, I would argue that managing churn or as I'd like to say, turning it upside down and talking about increasing loyalty is quickly becoming our greatest value driver and perhaps our most important priority as our company and industry mature. Third and finally, we'll carefully be reviewing our overall corporate and business development strategies. Let me just touch on a couple, starting with Latin America and international. I personally believe we have tremendous international growth opportunities ahead of us. First, we intend to fully leverage our strengths in Latin America and continue to drive strong growth in our businesses there, while at the same time, taking the chance to selectively assess opportunities outside of Latin America, particularly emerging markets. Now I understand that there has been some debate about the pros and cons of spitting DIRECTV Latin America off into a separate company. And although I've not drawn any final conclusions, certainly my initial thoughts are very similar to those you've heard expressed publicly by both Pat and Bruce, namely that I believe DIRECTV Latin America gain substantial and tangible operational, financial and competitive synergies by being a part of DIRECTV. I think those benefits should be quite apparent, particularly when you hear Bruce's comments later about their very significant leadership position in both HD and DVR services throughout the region. And I think it's also fair to say Bruce would point out, I think there's some things we could learn here in the U.S. from the success that we've had in Latin America. Second I believe Latin America still has significant growth potential, as well as value creation potential that we've yet to fully exploit on behalf of our shareholders.Now another question that I'm often asked is whether or not we're interested in buying content. Let me be clear, I don't see this as a primary focus for us. But I would say, my answer is pretty much the same probably as you've heard in the past from Chase. We will continue to opportunistically pursue what I'd call tucked under content deals that are neither overpriced and are deals where we could provide specific tangible value or synergies. One example where I could imagine that and where we certainly I think have some unique value is in sports. To state the obvious, sports is DIRECTV's greatest programming strength. And as such, it represents in an area where we have the greatest opportunity, I think, to create value. Now as part of the Liberty merger, we now own three regional sports networks, and I'm very excited about bringing DIRECTV's differentiated services to our fans in Seattle, Denver and Pittsburgh. Now we're also developing strategies to selectively gain DIRECTV market share those cities while also looking at other cities in the country for possible opportunities for expansion. In closing, let me just paraphrase John Malone when he introduced me as DIRECTV's new CEO of couple of months ago. John talked about the orchestra and the conductor, but from my standpoint, the great orchestra starts with having great musicians. I'm blessed to have those great musicians in our management team, as well as in our entire employee population. My job as the conductor of those great musicians is to continue to bring out the best in each and every one of them both as individuals, but most importantly, as a team. As someone who spent a lot of time in my career studying strategy and understanding competition and how to compete, I can assure you we will continue to win in the marketplace first and foremost while at the same time, consistently delivering strong, sustainable financial returns to our shareholders. We have an unbelievable set of assets here at DIRECTV, and I'm excited about our opportunity to make DIRECTV an even more fabulous service to our customers in the years ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill for a summary of DIRECTV Latin America's results and outlook. Bruce?"
29614,88670278,50642,"The DIRECTV Group, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mike.

Just as a quick reminder to everybody, all of the figures I'm about to d",1357,"Great. Thanks, Mike. Well, as Mike said, overall, DIRECTV Latin America had one of its best quarters ever, highlighted by our record-setting subscribers growth throughout the region. Just as a quick reminder to everybody, all of the figures I'm about to discuss exclude results for Sky Mexico, which we account for on an equity basis. However, it's important to note that Sky Mexico also had extremely strong subscriber growth in the quarter. Looking first at our growth additions, we achieved a new record in the quarter, growing 35% to $460,000 bringing our full year results to 1.58 million gross additions. What I'm particularly pleased about is that this growth occurred throughout the region. In addition to the strong results we're accustomed to seeing in countries like Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, we also experienced significant growth in other territories such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Chile. I think this speaks to the strength of our Pan-regional strategy. Furthermore, our growth is coming from both the higher end of the market, as well as from the Middle Market segments, which is becoming a more recent focus of our efforts. At the higher end, increasing sales of HD and DVR services are driving much of the growth. For example, sales of HD and DVR services to new customers are over twice the rate of a year ago and reached about 25% for all DTVLA's gross additions in the fourth quarter. Much of the increase sales are coming out of PanAmericana, where we're capitalizing on our DVR leadership position. But we're also seeing accelerated demand for HD services in Brazil. We launched our HD services there in the second quarter of last year, and we were already reaching double-digit penetration levels for new subscribers in Brazil. In Brazil, we have the most comprehensive HD offering in the country with about 30 channels, and we expect to further extend on our lead with the launch of new several channels this year, including additional HD programming from Global.With respect to our focus on the Middle Market segment, we've had success with both our prepaid offerings, as well as our lower priced postpaid packages. Prepaid gross adds compromise more than 25% of our total gross adds in the fourth quarter. Although most of our prepaid subscribers continue to come from Venezuela, we have begun to gain traction in other territories, such as Puerto Rico and Columbia. And a prepaid product is an important component of the sales increase in those territories that I referred to earlier. And in Brazil, our growth has been fueled by the recently launched Sky Digital Light package, which is a postpaid package targeted at the middle market.Turning now to churn, this is another area where we saw favorable trends in the quarter, as our average monthly churn rate declined five basis points to 1.54%. This improvement was mostly due to a nine basis point reduction in postpaid churn to 1.45% in the quarter, which represented the lowest postpaid churn level for us in over two years, well-below the 1.5% sweet spot that many of you have heard me talk about in the past for postpaid customers. Although Q4 has typically been a strong quarter for us in terms of churn, I do believe that much of this improvement reflects the increased penetration of HD and Standard Def [Definition] DVR services discussed earlier, as well as our use of more focus to upgrade and retention strategies. We're also seeing our prepaid churn levels have stabilize as this subscriber base matures, and we continue to refine our recharged strategies.I think it's also worth noting that our strong results for both closes and churn are favorably impacted by the relatively stable macroeconomic and financial conditions that we are currently seeing across most of the region. The combination of higher growth additions and lower churn drove a 59% increase in net additions to a record 254,000 in the quarter, bringing our DTVLA subscriber base to almost 4.6 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 18%. And if you include Sky Mexico, we now have over 6.5 million subscribers throughout Latin America.Looking now in our financials, DTVLA's revenues, earnings and cash flow were all solid in the quarter, particularly considering the higher cash repatriation charges in Venezuela. Revenues of $839 million were up 47%, driven by both strong subscriber and ARPU growth. Excluding the favorable FX impact coming primarily out of Brazil, revenues would've increased by around 35%. ARPU of about $63 in the fourth quarter grew 25% and reflected a favorable FX impact of about $5, again driven primarily by exchange rates in Brazil. Excluding the FX impact, the DTVLA's ARPU would've increased about 16% in the quarter reflecting both price increases and higher penetration of advanced products. Operating profits before depreciation and amortization increased 20% in the quarter to $219 million and includes a $45 million charge related to the exchange of Venezuelan currency for U.S. dollars, as we continue to repatriate cash from Venezuela. There were no comparable charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, we incurred $213 million in charges from repatriating cash from Venezuela, compared with only $29 million in 2008. Cash flow before interest and taxes, including these FX charges, was down a bit in the quarter as the increase in OPBDA was more than offset by higher subscriber-related CapEx reflecting the significant increase in gross adds and sales of advanced products.I'd like to conclude with a few comments about our 2010 outlook. Beginning with subscribers, we're looking for another great year with net adds at or above the record of 2009. This bullish outlook assumes that the overall economic and financial conditions remained generally stable and the strong trend seen last year continue in terms of increasing sales of HD, DVR and prepaid services. We're also anticipating strong demand for our differentiated and oftentimes exclusive coverage of the FIFA World Cup in the middle of the year. We will have about six hours of original programming each day. And in all countries except Brazil, we will be the only provider in Latin America showing all of the games live in high definition.Revenue growth this year is likely to be roughly half of last year's growth reflecting the effects of a devaluation in Venezuela. Otherwise, we would've expected about the same growth as last year. The two segments have been receiving a number of questions about the impact of this devaluation, I thought it would be helpful to provide a bit of color on this subject. As many of you know probably know, in January, the Venezuelan government announced that the official exchange rate for the Bolivar would go from 2.15 to 4.23 bolivars to the dollar. In other words, relative to 2009, Venezuelan revenues and ARPU will be reduced by about 50% when translated into dollars. From and OPBDA the perspective, however, were not expecting any significant impact from the devaluation because we have already been withdrawing excess Bolivars from Venezuela throughout the year at the even more unfavorable parallel rates, which has had the effect of depressing our OPBDA. In short, DTVLA's reported 2009 OPBDA of $697 million already has the Venezuelan devaluation baked in. Also keep in mind, most of the cost associated with the Venezuelan business, including programming, are denominated in the local currency. So at the consolidated DTVLA level, even with the rapid subscriber growth and the full year effect of the Venezuelan devaluation, we are targeting a very strong year in terms of OPBDA as we expect higher margins and subscriber growth to generate OPBDA growth of more than 20% in 2010 compared with 2009. However, cash flow before interest and taxes is likely to be modestly down, primarily because we're expecting an increase in CapEx, mostly due to the higher gross adds and increased sales of advanced products.So in wrapping things up, I hope you can see by my comments, we remain extremely bullish on our growth prospects in Latin America, and we look forward to an even better year in 2010. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat to discuss DIRECTV U.S. Pat?"
29614,88670278,50642,"The DIRECTV Group, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought DIRECTV U.S. had a very solid quarter highlighted by industry-leading revenue growth, higher margins largely gained through operational improvements and substantial free cash flow growth. The one area that fell below expe",1870,"Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought DIRECTV U.S. had a very solid quarter highlighted by industry-leading revenue growth, higher margins largely gained through operational improvements and substantial free cash flow growth. The one area that fell below expectations was subscriber growth, which I'll talk about in a minute. Looking first at the top line, DIRECTV U.S. revenue growth was solid at 8%. Although ARPU growth of 2.1% was flat with the third quarter's rate, we're actually quite pleased with the results because we saw several favorable trends that should carry into 2010. At the top of the list were premium channels or buyer rates in the fourth quarter declined at the slowest rates of the year, pay-per-view movie revenues were also solid and grew at the fastest rate of the year. The same holds true for advertising revenues, which were up about 13% over last year and represented our best quarter ever for ad sales. NFL Sunday Ticket revenues also were very strong and exceeded our expectations. So with these favorable trends, we remain confident that ARPU growth in 2010 will be greater than the level attained in 2009. Although net additions of 119,000 fell below our expectations, there were actually several positive trends in the quarter related to the quality of new subscribers and take rates for HD and DVR services. The decline in growth additions was mostly due to stricter credit policies and a more competitive environment.During the second half of the year, we implemented several policy changes aimed at further improving the profitability of new subscribers. For example, we raised the minimum credit score required for new customers to receive our national offers. We required credit cards on our commercial and MDU channels. We improved the profitability of the DIRECTV mass [ph] packages. And we dropped dealers that did not meet our quality standards. All of these measures impact growth additions however, we believe that over the long-term, subscriber returns will be greater due to the resulting lower churn and higher margins.But as I've mentioned, the overall quality of new subscribers remained high, both in terms of credit scores and sales of advanced services. For example, we reached a record high for HD and DVR sales as nearly 70% of new subscribers signed up for these services. By comparison, we added about 50% more HD and DVR customers than our largest competitor last year. As a result, we ended the year with an advanced services penetration rate of around 60% of our total subscriber base.Turning now to churn, I thought that the 1.52% in the quarter and the increase over the last year were consistent with our previously stated goal, striking at a better economic balance between our churn rate and the dollars spent to retain customers. As we discussed on the last call, we regularly update our offers for existing customers to reflect the more challenging economic and competitive landscape. In recent quarters, we've tightened up our offers by making them less attractive, particularly for lower quality subscribers. In some cases, these stricter policies result in higher cancellations, especially for the more price-sensitive customers who are shopping around for the cheapest deal. The return, however, is quite evident when you look at the more than 100 million or 23% reduction in our cash upgrade and spending expenses compared to last year's fourth quarter.Now looking out our cost and margins, I thought we did an excellent job managing cost in the quarter with the exception of SAC. As a result, DIRECTV U.S.'s OPBDA  margin increased 260 basis points to about 25% while OPBDA 21% to almost $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. About a half of the margin growth was due to the lower upgrade and retention cost that I talked about earlier. The next largest contributor was in programming, where we picked up a about a 60 basis point margin improvement over the prior year.  We've done a good job managing these calls all of year, leading to a full year programming costs increase of less than 2% per subscriber. Also in the fourth quarter, we benefited from booking profits on our existing NFL Sunday Ticket contract. You may recall it historically, we've booked our NFL Sunday Ticket revenues at zero margin. However, based on the greater than expected NFL revenues in the fourth quarter that I talked about earlier and the expectations of continued success this year, which by the way is the last year of the current contract, we started booking modest profits and expect to continue recognizing gains this year as well.Another area where we are seeing an important progress is in Subscriber Services. We've shared with you many of our targets and initiatives over the last couple of years. And it's encouraging that we're now starting to see the payoff. For example, fourth quarter service levels at our call centers were significantly better than a year ago and at a lower cost. Also our set-top box reliability is better, and we've implemented several technology advancements in the field aimed at improving efficiencies. And as a result, we've recently seen significant reductions in the number of truck rolls and service calls.The one area that did not meet expectations with SAC, which was greater than last year, primarily due to a higher marketing costs and investments in the home. As I mentioned earlier, we increased some of our offers for new customers to be more competitive. It's important to note that these offers were introduced in concert with our tighter credit policies to ensure that the quality of additions was not compromised. In addition, we're spending more money for advanced services and new technologies in the home. As an example, the percentage of new customers signing up for our HD DVR box, was 50% higher than a year ago while its receiver is roughly twice the cost of a standalone HD box. We also decided in Q4 to install our advanced SWM Dish, which stands for Single Wire Multi-Switch and all-new HD households. Although this new dish cost more than a standard dish, we believe this is an important investment to make as we strive to future proof customers homes in anticipation of the many new services we're introducing in the coming months, including Multi-Room Viewing, new broadband applications and the Home Media Center.So with a solid top line growth, higher margins and a 35% decline in capital expenditures, cash flow before interest and taxes grew by 42% to just under $1 billion, which was by far the best quarter ever for DIRECTV U.S. And at a consolidated DIRECTV level, fourth quarter free cash flow, which includes DIRECTV Latin America, taxes and interests, grow even faster at 64% to $710 million. These strong results contributed to a full year free cash flow growth of 40% to a record $2.36 billion in 2009.In terms of our consolidated balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $2.6 million of cash and about $8 billion of total debt. The debt balance at year end includes the Bank of America debt assumed at the completions of the Liberty transaction in November of last year. At year end, that balance was about $1.2 billion. And since then, we have continued to pay down the BofA debt and related equity collars and expect to be finished with that process later this month.Also in the quarter, we booked $29 million in revenues and $12 million in OPBDA for our three new regional sports networks. These results are included in our Sports Networks, Eliminations and other segment. We're very excited about owning the Pittsburgh, Rocky Mountain and North West RSNs [Regional Sports Network] and welcome them to the DIRECTV family. Before turning the call back over to John, I'd like to provide our 2010 outlook for both DIRECTV U.S. and for the consolidated company. Starting at the top line for DIRECTV U.S., we're targeting revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range, which is very similar to last year's level. Relative to 2009, we're expecting less contribution from our subscriber growth. But as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting faster ARPU growth in 2010 compared to 2009. We're also looking for an increase in OPBDA margin, which is expected to help drive OPBDA growth in the low teens range. Cash flow before interest and taxes growth is expected to be a bit higher in the mid-teens range as we target another year-over-year decline and set-top box CapEx. For non-set-top box CapEx, it's likely to remain in the $500 million to $600 million range we have seen in the past. At the consolidated company level, cash flow before interest and taxes expected to be strong and consistent with the DIRECTV U.S. performance. However, cash taxes are expected to increase quite a bit in 2010 due to our higher profit levels and the cessation of the benefits gained over the past couple of years from the accelerated depreciation associated with the two economic stimulus programs in the U.S. In addition, we're anticipating greater interest expense as we increase our leverage. As a result, free cash flow, which I'll remind you grew at a faster than expected rate last year of 40%, is likely to be in the mid single-digit range. EPS is expected to more than double to over $2. Excluding the nearly $500 million charge in 2009 related to the Liberty transactions, we're targeting EPS growth of some 50% driven by the OPBDA growth, lower depreciation and amortization expenses and a continued decline in shares outstanding due to buybacks.And finally, a few words about our return to capital strategy in the balance sheet, which I know our topics of great interest to many of you. First, as you saw in our press release this morning, we announced a new share repurchase program of $3.5 billion. We still believe that our stock is undervalued, and as such, we will continue repurchasing our stock in the same aggressive, but opportunistic fashion you've seen from us over the past few years. We expect to begin repurchasing shares soon once the equity colors have been fully unwound. Regarding our total debt to OPBDA target, at this time, we do not have a specific timeline for achieving that target. Many of you know the difficulty in predicting when and if we hit that target, particularly considering the uncertainty of the financial markets combined with our low net debt and rapidly growing OPBDA. Indeed, a problem most companies could only hope for. Having said that, we will carefully review our longer-term capital structure with our Board as part of our overall strategy efforts this spring. We will share any further thoughts on that once our board has had a chance to review our thinking and approve a longer-term capital structure. So in summary, as we head into this new year, we feel real good about our operating and financial strengths, and look forward to further extending our video leadership position with the many new and exciting products we'll be launching later this year. And with these strengths, we're targeting yet another year in which we lead the industry in both top line and bottom line growth as well as returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jon."

And I think there's always been a balance there as you look at whether you're putting money to work or focusing on near-term earnings, which as you know, in the short-term, are actually inversely correlated. How are you thinking about that balance when you look at the business today, you mentioned the competitive landscape and the maturing business model, but you also talk about product investments, et cetera and opportunities to do more than you already doing in terms of product delivery.

And to your point exactly, Ben, I think a business is interconnected is this, it is about finding the right equilibrium. And as a business matures, in my mind, as I said in the call, I'm frankly more interested in how we create passionate loyalty out of our consumers for life than necessarily chasing lower quality subs. But having said all of that, we need to stay competitive. And I'm used to kind of whether they're Map-of-Wars or whether they're Cola Wars, and we intend to be fully competitive. But I think it is a balance to your point exactly. And I would say we recognized that the industry has gotten a bit more competitive in the last six months and we are fine tuning our own strategies accordingly. But at the same time, I think DIRECTV has been very good about trying to consciously manage and strike the appropriate balance between the discipline with which we managed our ARPU, our SAC and our costs to ensure we continue to deliver strong cash flow to our shareholders. I guess my view is I think it's a bit of both, unfortunately. We got to both be competitive, but at the same time, I think, it doesn't do anybody any good to chase poor quality subs. And I think it's that delicate balance, if you will, that we will continue to strike as we head into this year."

But as I said, from a financial standpoint, I think 1.5% is probably about the sweet spot for us on churn.

Using our SWM technology, which we think is a great decision in the quarter that had some affect on it. We did match the competitors a little bit. I shouldn't say match, I mean we came in with a cash back offer. So there were some things in the fourth quarter that might have been unique. But like Mike said, what we see going forward is we are going to make some investments in the Home in 2010. And whether it's Multi-Room Viewing, it's a higher percentage of broadband, connectivity later in the year, Home Media Center, we obviously have the full effect in the year of using the SWM on all of our HD installs. All of those, we think are kind of must investments in the Home. And that we'll, as Mike said it, first of all, make for a better experience for the customer, on a secured customer and plus they're all revenue opportunities. So kind of looking at the fourth quarter, there was certain things that drove the rate to what it is. But going forward, we will be investing a little bit more in the Home. So as Mike said, I wouldn't necessarily  see the rate coming down much from the fourth quarter rate, but for the rate that will be for different reasons as we invest more in the Home."

I frankly, the math I've seen and I've looked at it with a couple of anchors, I'm also not yet sold that if you try and split off or spin off a business that has two joint ventures in the middle of it, one in Brazil and one in Mexico, that I'm going to create more shareholder value that way. I'd be pretty surprised, frankly, from my experience in looking at that issue. But I would say, first and foremost, this is a business that's just blossoming right now. And to me, we've got significant value creation potential over the next few years. I'll never say never on anything. I think we'll always look at what's in our shareholders best interest. But if I look at it today, at least my initial reaction is that I think there's a lot of value creation. And I think it's up to us to do a better job of explaining to you all how we're going to realize that value, and what our strategies are to deliver it. On the second question on being a subscriber, yes, when John Malone first interviewed me, I happened to be a subscriber in Connecticut and so I'm a very happy subscriber. I was very familiar with the product and frankly, as someone out of the Consumer business, when I first took this job, I think there were three things that I looked at. One, is it a great product, two is it a great brand and three is what's the culture of the team of people you're going to work with. And in all of three of those fronts as I did my due diligence, I was very, very enthusiastic about this company that I was joining. And so I think our user interface is better than anybody else's. I think that once you've seen high-def, you'd never go back to standard-def. I think the sports offerings that we have are second to none. And I also think that more than anybody else, we don't just aggregate content. We do what I call distinctive content with a twist. Eric Shanks and his team, I think are always thinking creatively about what else we can do there. I think we're certainly, from my experience, the best marketer of multiple channel video our there.

Whatever it is we do, I'm a big believer that we should be consistent and do something that's sustainable over a long period of time. And as I said, we are also going to look at other opportunities to see if there's a better return than that. But frankly, our base case that we'll be looking at with our Board, we think we would return the cash to shareholders probably. We need to figure out what the optimal strategy between dividend and buyback. But I wouldn't rule anything out, I wouldn't rule a dividend out at this time. I think, again, that's something for our Board to consider. And Pat and his team will be framing up our thinking on that sometime later this spring."

Just a refresher if that's the right way to think about it and if there's any other limitation that we should think about maybe from a tax perspective? And then second question, just real quickly, you talk about remaining competitive. In some of the recent plan changes from December into January, you took away the low-end family plan. So you really don't have a low-end price point in the market at this point.

Let me start with just a couple of opening remarks and then I'm going to turn the call over to Pat Doyle and Bruce Churchill for any additional color on both our U.S. and Latin America businesses.",1631,"Thanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start with just a couple of opening remarks and then I'm going to turn the call over to Pat Doyle and Bruce Churchill for any additional color on both our U.S. and Latin America businesses. 
Overall, I think we got off to a terrific start in 2010 as our businesses in both Latin America and the United States turned in extremely strong first quarter results, leading as you saw this morning to more than doubling our free cash flow to a record $1 billion while our earnings per share nearly tripled to $0.59. Now with that said, I certainly would not suggest you just take our first quarter results and multiply them by four to predict our full year outlook. Sooner or later, we will have to pay some taxes. However, it's clear that our businesses are demonstrating tremendous operating strength, and I think that positions us nicely to meet or exceed the full year guidance we provided on our last earnings call.
Let me first turn to the United States where I believe there are three key takeaways from the quarter. First, our top line results were strong and appear to have been modestly supported by the slowly improving consumer economy. Second, the significant increase in margins reflects the benefits we're capturing from DIRECTV's operating scale and efficiencies, as well as ongoing efforts to focus on more disciplined cost containment. And finally, fueled by strong topline growth and expanding margins, DIRECTV is demonstrating the very substantial cash flow-generating capability of our company.
Let me touch on each of those three items. First, in terms of revenues. I was very pleased with our 11% growth. We did see some very encouraging trends in the quarter, particularly related to sales of premium movie channels, pay per view movies and events, as well as higher advertising revenues. Now I'd attribute much of that improvement to better execution. But as the economy also continues to improve, customers do appear more willing to purchase additional content and premium services. 
Net subscriber additions of 100,000 were generally in line with our internal expectations. It's certainly still very competitive out there, but I would say no more so than the trends we saw in the fourth quarter.
At DIRECTV, we all believe there's still plenty of growth left in the pay TV market, particularly when you consider both our differentiated advantages and our planned innovations. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and in the next year, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see favorable growth trends, particularly if the housing market expands and the competitive landscape remains stable. In addition, we're expecting to benefit from some more targeted marketing tactics that we're in the process of developing and implementing.
I'm also particularly excited about several upcoming product launches that will once again demonstrate our leadership and innovation in the industry. I believe they will further strengthen both our brand and our reputation for delivering the best video experience in America. For instance, just a couple of weeks ago, we became the first video provider to offer national high-definition distribution of Univision and TeleFutura. This is particularly important when you think about the World Cup, which begins next month. And it also marked the beginning of DIRECTV's expansion to more than 160 high-definition channels over the coming weeks. Next week, we officially roll out Multi-Room Viewing services and then in June, we begin broadcasting in 3D. 
Now much like with high definition a few years ago, we at DIRECTV intend to take a leadership position in 3D. Initially, we'll offer three dedicated 3D channels including ESPN 3D, and our own channel named N3D. DIRECTV customers who have 3D televisions and equipment will be able to watch top-rated 3D movies as well as exciting sporting event such as the World Cup and Major League Baseball All-Star Game. 
In fact, just yesterday, you saw that we announced that DIRECTV will present the first-ever major league baseball telecast in 3D on July 10 and 11 when the New York Yankees take on the Seattle Mariners. And later in the summer, we'll introduce our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service, which will greatly expand the number of on-demand and Pay Per View movies we offer our customers. So as you can see, we'll be introducing a host of new products and services that we believe could potentially bolster both subscriber and ARPU growth as well as reduced churn.
Now I would point out that we don't expect the rate of growth that we experienced in the first quarter necessarily to continue for the balance of the year due in part to a couple of one-time items that Pat will cover later on. 
Turning now to the cost side of the ledger. I think we've really done an excellent job managing our cost as you saw in the nearly five percentage point increase in our OPBDA margin. You could look at practically every line on our income statement and see the specific actions that our teams have taken across DIRECTV to contain costs, and in most cases, grow margins. Upgrade and retention costs, which were down about 20% on a cash basis from prior year, is a good example where we struck a favorable economic balance between lower cost and slightly higher churn. 
The reduction in upgrade costs for existing customers is also related to the increased equipment investment that we're making in all of our new customers. About 70% of new subscribers in the first quarter signed up for HD and/or DVR services, which compares to only about 60% a year ago. We believe that this strategy will not only help reduce churn in the long run, but will reduce the likelihood of a customer calling us to upgrade one or two years down the road.
Another area that's operating more efficiently are our call centers, where we've attained the highest service levels in years. Yet when viewed on a per square subscriber basis, our call center costs in the first quarter were down about 5%. Subscriber acquisition cost, SAC, was the one area that was slightly higher than we would've liked due to a conscious decision we made to respond to the challenging competitive conditions in the quarter, but also due to the aforementioned strategy of increasing our upfront investment in advanced equipment for new subscribers.
Turning to DIRECTV Latin America, we had another great quarter across the board, and most notably, I would say in the area of subscriber growth. As many of you will recall, unlike the United States, pay TV penetration in Latin America is quite low. I was just down to Brazil with Bruce Churchill and the team last week and I was very excited with what I saw. I like to remind people that in Brazil, which is our fastest growing market, less than 15% of households have pay television. Add to that a relatively stable macroeconomic environment plus the region's best TV experience and you can understand why were you seeing unprecedented subscriber growth in Latin America. The growth is diversified from both an economic and geographic perspective. Economically, we're getting the best subscribers at the higher income levels through our superior HD and DVR offerings. And we're also doing well attacking the middle market segments with our popular prepaid and lower priced postpaid packages we launched earlier this year.
DIRECTV Latin America's growth is also geographically diversified through our pan-regional presence and from the fact that we're growing in both young and more mature markets. For instance, it might surprise you to hear that some of our best performing countries in the quarter were Ecuador and Colombia, which is quite a turnaround from a year ago where we were uncompetitive in those markets. And as good as our results were in the first quarter, I'm looking for even better numbers in the second quarter when we begin our unparalleled coverage of the World Cup.
In a few minutes, Bruce will provide you with more details about Latin America, so let me just wrap up my update on a couple of important other items. First, as we mentioned on our last earnings call, one of our top priorities is developing a strategy for returning capital to shareholders. We've made a lot of good progress with that strategy, and Pat's going to provide you with some more details in a few minutes. Also on the last call, I said that we begin a company-wide strategic review in the spring. We're making great progress in that area.
We plan to present our recommendations to our Board of Directors in the summer, and after that, we'll host an investor day in the fall to provide you with a much more detailed view of both our businesses and our outlook.
Earlier, I also shared with you some of the products we'll be launching over the coming months. Discussions with our board have been more long-term focused with a particular emphasis on the steps we're taking to achieve our goal of delivering DIRECTV whenever and wherever our customers want it. And we'll have more to say about that this fall as well. 
In summary, now that we've completed the first full quarter since becoming DIRECTV CEO, I can honestly say that our assets, our balance sheet and most importantly the talented people all across DIRECTV are even better and stronger than I had anticipated. More importantly, I think, so are our opportunities for continued future growth. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months as we continue to share our strategies for increasing shareholder value. So with that, let me turn it over to Bruce Churchill to review our DIRECTV Latin America first quarter results."
29614,104431673,60050,"DIRECTV, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-06-2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In the last earnings call, I talked a lot about our record-setting subscriber growth throughout the regions. I'm happy to say that I may also reuse much of the speech I gave last quarter as our subscriber results in Q1 were even better. I sp",1046,"Thanks, Mike. In the last earnings call, I talked a lot about our record-setting subscriber growth throughout the regions. I'm happy to say that I may also reuse much of the speech I gave last quarter as our subscriber results in Q1 were even better. I spoke with all of you about Q4, spoke about an all-time record of $460,000 gross additions. Well, in Q1 of this year, gross additions were up 34% versus last year. [indiscernible] (22:56) And the reasons behind this success are very similar to those I shared with you a few months ago. 
Higher into the market, growth continued to be driven by increasing sales of our industry-leading HD and DVR services. 30% of our new customers signed up for advanced services in the quarter at about three times the level of a year ago and up five percentage points of the same rates in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year growth is split fairly evenly between HD and DVR services. 
HD growth remained strong in Brazil where we offered 3x as many HD channels as anybody else and HD has picked up steam in PanAmericana as well, where we have been expanding our offerings. Increase in DVR sales has been particularly strong in countries such as Argentina and Colombia. And as I discussed in my response to your question as quarter, we just like to reiterate that the success we're having in both HD and DVRs is a testament to the competitive advantage we've created in Latin America by leveraging the set-top box technology developed by DIRECTV U.S., enabled us to get to market with better products sooner at a lower cost. 
We're also seeing strong growth from our strategy to aggressively go after the Middle Market segment as much lower penetration rates for pay TV services in Latin America [indiscernible] (24:22). Core of this strategy focuses on three main marketing tactics: Prepaid packages, Lower-priced postpaid packages and the bundling of our service where possible with the local telco. 
In terms of prepaid services, we've had the greatest success in countries such as Venezuela and more recently, in Colombia, Chile and Ecuador. Venezuela represents a country where we've offered prepaid services for the longest period of time. And as such, prepaid penetration has reached over 30% of total subscribers in that country. From a DTVLA consolidated perspective, prepaid subscribers as  a percent of total gross adds have been running in the 20 plus percent range. We expect that level to continue for the balance of the year. In addition, lower-priced postpaid packages have been extremely popular in Brazil and we've got some early success bundling DIRECTV with local telcos in Colombia and Argentina. 
Turning now to churn. Our monthly rate obviously higher than a year ago. But then it increases almost entirely due to the initial instability surrounding the currency devaluation in Venezuela. In particular, the instability impacted prepaid churn the most. However, we remain cautiously optimistic amid a sea of uncertainty created by the devaluation in Venezuela will diminish with the passage of time and that more normal market conditions will prevail for the rest of the year. 
Excluding prepaid churn, our consolidated postpaid churn in the region was extremely strong, declined about 10 basis points in the prior year, 1.56%. I attribute most of this improvement to the increased sales of HD and DVR services, as well as our more focused upgrade and retention packages. Even with the challenges in Venezuela, our financial results were quite strong. 30% increase at the top line was mostly due to subscriber growth, but we also saw some favorable pricing trends in the quarter. 
Our three quarters of our 9.5% ARPU growth is related to price increases, higher sales of advanced services. The remaining portion of ARPU growth was foreign exchange related but benefits gained in Brazil were only partially offset by the devaluation in Venezuela. OPBDA was also very solid and more than doubled over last year's results. Majority of the growth was due to the gross profit and the incremental revenues, as well as lower charges related to timing of repatriating cash from Venezuela. 
In terms of our full year outlook, it's too early in the year to revise or financial guidance. However, we feel that our first quarter performance is a good piece of evidence to support our bullish outlook for the balance of the year. As Mike mentioned, certainly the second quarter should be another strong quarter. As many of you know, FIFA World Cup  kicks off in South Africa in June 11. We expect to take advantage of the excitement around this event to deliver a record number of gross and net adds for the quarter, which should be in the high water mark for the year. 
The challenge will be to hold on to these subscribers during the balance of the year particularly in the Prepaid segment. However, this issue is already on our radar screen and we've been through this before. So I'm confident the vast majority of those subscribers would chose to stay with DIRECTV even after the excitement of the World Cup subsides. 
Finally, I would like to bring your attention to two additional points. Those of you who are on the call with Televisa last week will know that our affiliate, Sky Mexico, had a ten-fold increase in net addition to about 240,000 subscribers in the first quarter. Probably [ph] (28:16) on the back of their recently launched prepaid product, VTV. Including these results, our Latin America platform now exceeds 7 million subscribers. I would just like to add that we crossed the 1 million-subscriber mark in both Argentina and Venezuela this quarter. So it's quite clear that growth remained strong throughout the entire region. 
Secondly, I would just like to note that our company, Sky Brazil, was just awarded the Brazilian equivalent of the J.D. Power Award for best service provider in the communications industry. This is the eighth year in a row that Sky Brazil has won this award. I highlight this award to make a point that even with our growth, we still remain very much focused on providing the best customer experience in the business. And with that I'll conclude my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Pat."

From a financial perspective, I thought that our Q1 results were as good as any quarter in our history. Our revenue growth was solid, but I thought our management of cost and margins were even stronger. And the free cash flow growth speaks",1337,"Thanks, Bruce. From a financial perspective, I thought that our Q1 results were as good as any quarter in our history. Our revenue growth was solid, but I thought our management of cost and margins were even stronger. And the free cash flow growth speaks for itself. 
Looking first at the top line for DIRECTV U.S., industry-leading revenue growth of 11% was solid and was mostly driven by ARPU, which at 85.47 was a touch higher than our internal target. 
As Mike mentioned, we're seeing much better results at premiums, pay-per-view and video-on-demand movies as well as in pay-per-view events. As we've shared with you in the past, the buy rates for many of these revenue categories had been declining for years and our goal has been to reverse this trend or to at least slow the rate of decline. I believe we are doing just that, and our team has on a terrific job getting these important revenue categories back on the right track. 
Also contributing to ARPU growth was our annual price increase, which we accelerated by one month this year, higher NFL Sunday Ticket revenues due to the January game, increased revenues from HD and DVR services as well as greater advertising revenue. Net subscriber additions of 100,000 were generally in line with our expectations as both gross additions and churn were consistent with internal projection. On our last earnings call, we mentioned that gross additions this year will probably be lower than last year. We expect this year-over-year decline to be most pronounced in the first quarter due mainly to the one-time benefit gained last year from the digital transition.
Many of the stricter credit measures we've implemented over the past several quarters continue to yield positive results. The overall credit quality of new subscribers remains high and our customers continue to purchase advanced services at an industry-leading rate. As a point of reference, our penetration of HD and DVR services is now North of 60% of total subscribers or about 50% higher than the largest cable company's penetration of about 40%.
Another trend worth noting is the lower contribution from our telco partners. Last year, the telcos reached as high as 25% of total gross additions, and during this past quarter, their share dipped below 20%. This decline is related to several factors, including the continued rollout of FIOS and U-verse as well as the rapid decline in their land lines which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at their call centers. 
Looking briefly at churn, the year-over-year increase in the first quarter was a bit higher than the previous two quarters. However, we're quite pleased with this level for a couple of reasons. First, although the competitive environment last quarter was comparable to the fourth quarter, it was much more challenging than a year ago. Second, we've done a good job managing the trade-off between modestly higher churn and lower upgrade and retention cost. We continue to prioritize our best offer to our best customers and as a result, we believe that most of the increase in churn is related to lower quality subscribers who have a greater propensity to shop around for the best deal. The bottom line is that this level of churn is consistent with our target range for the full year of between 1.5% and 1.6% per month.
Turning now to costs. As I mentioned, this was clearly one of our greatest strengths in the quarter as the nearly five-point increase in OPBDA margin was the largest year-over-year improvement since we implemented the lease model for set-top boxes in early 2006. A portion of the margin growth was due to the decline in gross additions. However, with the exception of SAC, every other line item on our income statement came in better than our internal targets. The largest contributor to our increase in Pre-SAC margin was upgrade in retention marketing, which from a cash perspective, declined 79 million or 20% to the lowest level in two years. This rather significant reduction, particularly considering our larger subscriber base, is primarily due to the increased investment in SAC for new customers increased usage off refurbished boxes and lower manufacturing cost for new equipment.
We're also seeing solid results in subscriber services. The performance in our call centers and installation network is particularly rewarding because of the compounding benefit. That is, we're achieving higher service levels and a relatively lower cost. But more importantly, the customer experience is greatly enhanced, which should drive lower churn in the future. In addition, we did a good job managing programming cost as our first quarter margin was relatively flat versus a year ago despite the increase in premium and pay-per-view revenues, which generally have lower margins.
Also in the quarter, we saw a decline in capital expenditures related to set-top boxes, which combined with double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins, drove substantial free cash flow growth in the quarter. The nearly $1 billion of free cash flow was not only a record for DIRECTV U.S. but was almost double last year's result. 
I'd like to wrap up my opening remarks with a few comments about our outlook and strategy for returning capital to shareholders. Our strong first quarter results provide us with greater confidence that we will meet or exceed the full year guidance provided on our last earnings call. It's worth noting, however, that the revenue and OPBDA growth profile this year is in many ways, the opposite of last year's results. In other words, DIRECTV's first quarter 2009 revenue and OPBDA growth were the lowest of the year and generally improved throughout the year. Obviously, that profile impacts our growth rates this year. Also keep in mind that we be benefited from a few one-time items in the first quarter including revenues for the additional NFL game, lower charges for repatriating cash out of Venezuela and the gain related to the unwinding of the Bank of America collar.
In terms of cash flow, as you saw in our release, tax payments in the first quarter were quite modest. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect free cash flow growth to be impacted by higher tax payments compared to both the prior quarter and prior year, primarily due to the increase in our pretax earnings. Our goal, however, is to manage DIRECTV's cash tax rate of roughly the same level as last year despite the unfavorable impact due to the reversal of benefits gained from the previous two economic stimulus packages. 
In terms of DIRECTV strategy for returning capital, I'd like to first point out that our top priority for creating shareholder value remains to reinvest in our core businesses. Our second priority is to return excess free cash flow and liquidity to shareholders in a timely manner. In that regard, our board approved our plan to reach a leverage target of the 2.5x total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPBDA by the end of next year. Reaching those leverage target within the next year and a half will obviously be impacted by market conditions and our ability to tap the debt markets at reasonable rates. 
In addition to executing on our plan to reach 2.5x leverage, we'll also evaluate ways to further increase liquidity by utilizing DIRECTV Latin America's rapidly growing OPBDA. In terms of returning capital, at this time, we prefer repurchasing shares over other means based on a variety of factors including our current stock price, the favorable spread between our after-tax cost of debt and free cash flow yield and other tax considerations. 
Through yesterday, we had repurchased just over $1 billion of stock so far this year, leaving about $2.5 billion on our current $3.5 billion authorization. We have not ruled out other options for returning capital and we will continue to assess and review the merits of these with our board on an ongoing basis. So at this time, I'm going to turn the call back to John so that we can begin our Q&A."

As we've worked at it, again, this is a bit of a work in process in terms of our strategy we review with our Board of Directors. What became very clear to us though, in the work that we were doing, is that our very first priority should be to get our balance sheet to the appropriate leverage level, if you will, for being an investment-grade company. And hence, that is the focus of what we were talking about today, and we felt that it would be helpful to communicate a clear date by which we plan to be there. Now as we look at that, and as Pat said, first of all, frankly, given just the tax constraints we're under, we've got plenty of room to accomplish that on share buyback, kind of just open market purchases. We are clearly and will continue to look at a number of other ways that we could get there and evaluate what's in the company and the shareholders' best interest in terms of whether you do tenders or that kind of thing. It's not really needed to get to where we want to get to. But we're looking at any kind of financial instruments that would make sense. We'll obviously be assessing, but we can get there with open market purchases. As it relates to the question of dividends, frankly, first and foremost, I think our priority should be to get our balance sheet set properly. We can then have a conversation about whether we are 100% share buyback or some mix of dividends and buyback at that time. I'm sure we've all looked at dividend practices before. And in my view, at least, it's going to be heavily influenced by what the federal government does with tax rates on dividends, as at least one important consideration for some of our shareholders. But we haven't made a decision on that one way or the other. I think it's a little premature. But certainly, as we work through our strategy this summer, we'll probably have more to say on it, either later this year or early next year. Certainly, we'll talk about more specifics about our share repurchase. But for right now, I would say, our focus is on continuing our open market purchase program.

I don't think I would single-out one competitor or another. As Pat highlighted, we have seen a bit elevated churn levels in territories where files and U-Verse are being rolled out. I would say, our churn levels were pretty close to in line, maybe a tad higher than what we would have liked in the first quarter. But frankly, the trends we've seen since the end of the first quarter are very encouraging. And I have to hasten that, that some of the strategies that we've put in place to manage churn, which is to encourage more loyalty, really weren't getting fully put into place until the end of the first quarter. So some of the benefits of that should kick in, in the balance of the year. I would say, the key thing for us -- there's no Nielsen out there, like I'm used to looking at from my consumer products stays to look at share trends in that level of detail. But we're very pleased. We're right in line with our expectations on both gross and net adds. And as I look at the balance of the year, also the quality of the adds, as Pat said, 70% are taking advanced services. So we're continuing to see very, very positive trends in terms of the quality of the subscribers we're bringing on.

And if you look at the average life of our fleet, but because the procurement period and build period is so long for a satellite, we felt it was prudent to start to begin thinking about replacements/back-up. Having said that, just because the payments on satellites are spread over the construction period, we still feel comfortable that, that fits into the kind of $500 million to $600 million kind of non-set-top box CapEx that we've talked about before. I've said I think we'll probably -- once the D14 gets done or close to done, we may be thinking about another one.

So to be honest with you, I actually was quite happy with the gross adds. I think we're continuing to work on the churn.

But we're just kind of looking at, as Latin America, again, continues to grow, continues to grow EBITDA, free cash flow. Today, they're not generating that much, because they're in a heavy growth mode. But we think by kind of the time we get to the end of '11, the DIRECTV Latin America would be another asset that would allow us to either put it into our combined credit or look at other options to also leverage that EBITDA at 2.5x, to kind of continue to be able to return cash to the shareholders.

And certainly, areas like commercial and MDU are certainly among those areas that we're working on for those kinds of things. So I wouldn't say it's only that.

But I think it's a bit premature for me to go into any more specifics on that at this time. On the international question, we did do some work. Bruce Churchill and his team did a kind of a bit of a scan around the world, and we've done some preliminary thinking and discussing about what the findings of that were. To be honest with you, one of the first observations, I guess, after we got done with the review that I had was, boy, Latin America is even better than I thought. I mean, both because of the opportunities that we have to invest down there. And second, because in so many other countries, there are significant restrictions on foreign ownership. In a number of cases, you can't have any. And so I think, frankly, our conclusion was after a looksee, that there may be opportunities down the road in emerging markets that will pop up and we will continue to look at them outside of Latin America. But I didn't see anything eminent or of a focus that we would chase immediately. As I said, if anything, I think both Bruce's and my conclusion was, boy, let's double down in Latin America. We got a great opportunity there, and we have a reasonably favorable regulatory environment for pay TV, and still tremendous penetration growth potential, and also new products and services potential: bundling, Internet, content, all kinds of ways that we can play."

Overall, I thought our second quarter results in both the United States and Latin America were very strong and reflects solid execution of our key three core strategies for creating shareholder value. 
First, we're generating very solid topline growth, driven by the strength of our brand, as well as an unrivaled suite of compelling products and services. In that regard, DIRECTV's consolidated revenue growth of 12% leads the industry and is due in large part to our company's portfolio of businesses all across the Americas, reflecting diverse geographies, demographics and growth profiles. 
Second, of course, our traditional focus on operating excellence, which is driving strong margins and cash flow growth. There, both of our U.S. and Latin American businesses grew their margins in the second quarter. Our earnings per share increased 50% excluding the impact from the Malone transaction, and our year-to-date free cash flow was up 40% to $1.4 billion. 
And third, as we spoke to you on our last call, we're continuing to execute our strategy of aggressively returning capital to shareholders. As you saw in the earnings release, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of stock in the second quarter, representing one of the largest quarterly share buybacks in our history. 
Now before turning the call over to Pat and Bruce for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin America businesses, let me just offer a few observations. First, starting with Latin America. While, clearly, we expected a strong quarter, I think it's fair to say that net additions of 415,000 exceeded all of our expectations. And to put that number into perspective, it was more than 3x the net additions of a year ago and over 60% higher than our previous record set just two quarters ago. The FIFA World Cup, coupled with a relatively strong macroeconomic landscape, propelled a lot of that growth. But we're also continuing to see very solid momentum across the entire region driven by our industry-leading HD and DVR services, as well as popular postpaid and prepaid packages. 
I was also extremely pleased to see that even with that rapid subscriber growth, Bruce and his team were able to significantly increase their operating profit before depreciation and amortization, and the margins by over seven percentage points to almost 31%. 
Now I think we also had a very solid results with our U.S. business. Furthermore, we saw some key trends develop in the quarter, particularly in the areas of both subscriber and ARPU growth that, I believe, position us well for the second half of the year. 
Our net additions of 100,000 were a touch better than our expectations. But importantly, gross adds and churns strengthened throughout the quarter. We're becoming much more targeted in our marketing strategies as well as our new promotions, which is enabling us to drive higher gross additions with much greater penetration of both HD and DVR services. Due in part to our free HD offer, which was introduced at the end of the quarter, we reached a record high penetration level of over 70% in the quarter for new subscribers activating with advanced services. So they're very high-quality subscribers. 
We're also very excited about the additional demand that will be generated through our new partnership with CenturyLink, which was officially launched just this past Sunday, and we're off to a terrific start already taking orders. I might also add that we have exclusive distribution in 12 out of the 13 states that Frontier operates in, and we have an excellent partnership with them as well. 
In addition to growing demand for new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job of retaining existing subscribers. Our monthly churn rate of 1.51% was equal to prior-year's second quarter, breaking a five-quarter trend of higher year-over-year churn rates. 
Much like our strategy with gross additions, we're taking a much more targeted approach to managing churn through improved segmentation. And as a result, we saw a reduction in voluntary churn for the first time in nine quarters. I believe this decline is also due to our improved customer service and boxed reliability efforts. 
ARPU growth was an equally strong story in the quarter. The favorable trends that we talked about on our last earnings call, particularly regarding premiums, Pay Per View and advertising continued in the second quarter, and in some cases, strengthened even further. Premium movie revenues generated the largest favorability to our expectations in prior year. But we're also seeing very solid results in Pay Per View, movies and events. In addition, advertising revenues were very strong as we posted the best second quarter in our history. 
Moving now to the bottom line, I was pleased with the nearly one percentage point increase in our DIRECTV U.S. operating profit before depreciation, amortization margin to over 28%, representing our highest margin in two years. We're continuing to execute well in areas such as programming, subscriber services and upgrade and retention marketing. 
Our SAC was a bit higher than we would've liked. However, I must point out that most of that increase is related to business decisions that we consciously made to provide our customers with advanced equipment, which improves both long-term customer loyalty, as well as topline growth. 
For instance, roughly 2/3 of the year-over-year increase in SACs for the quarter was due to the higher penetration of advanced services that I mentioned earlier, as well as additional investment that we announced late last year related to new services such as our Whole-Home DVR. As a point of reference, we saw our HD penetration rate increase almost 50% after we launched our free HD offer to new consumers. 
We'll continue to make these investments in a financially prudent fashion to ensure that we capture the appropriate returns. It's no coincidence that many of the favorable ARPU and churn trends discussed earlier relate to the increased SAC investment we've made in previous quarters. 
Now before turning the call over to Bruce for some remarks about Latin America, let me just wrap up with an update on a couple of other important items and an overview of our key priorities for the second half of the year. First, we're making terrific progress in our company-wide strategic review. Earlier this week, we had a chance to have a very constructive two-day strategic retreat with our Board of Directors, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you in the fall at our Investor Day. 
We're also making very good progress on adding new Board members. Last month, I was delighted to be able to add Sam DiPiazza to our Board. I've known Sam a long time. He brings a wealth of experience and expertise, and most recently served as the Global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers International from 2002 to 2009. We're working hard to continue to fill the remaining Board seats, and we hope to land a couple more Directors before year end. 
In terms of my top priorities for the second half, I guess I'd go back to the opening comments I made about our core strategies for creating growth and shareholder value. First, we either continue to reinvigorate growth at the top line by delivering on our goal of making DIRECTV the best video experience in the world. Specifically in the second half, that includes building on and extending our industry-leading position in HD, 3D and mobile sports. As you may have noticed, last quarter, we launched three dedicated 3D channels and added 30 new HD channels for the extra capacity provided by our new satellite. We've also just launched our popular NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion with more value and features than ever before and a terrific ad campaign, and I'm very excited about that. 
We are now including all of the services that used to be part of our SuperFan package including games in HD and the Game Mix and RED ZONE CHANNELS at no extra charge to our customers. And we're also introducing an NFL SUNDAY TICKET TO-Go service for about $50, which will provide live-streaming video of the games on mobile devices like the iPad or via a computer through directv.com. 
Also in the second half, we intend to increase penetration of newer services such as our Whole-Home DVR, as well as services requiring an Internet connection to our receivers. And later this year, we'll introduce a greatly enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service that's designed to not only take share from other movie services, but most importantly, to significantly improve the overall movie experience for all of our DIRECTV customers. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we'll continue refining and improving our segmentation strategies for how we acquire and retain customers so that we optimize our subscriber growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to have a heightened focus on increasing productivity, operational excellence and driving operation efficiencies. Whether these come in G&A, our call centers, our installation network or anywhere else across our enterprise, it's critical that we strive for operating excellence to counter out some of the cost pressures that we've seen in areas such as SAC and overall programming expense. 
And finally, we'll continue to repurchase stock in an aggressive fashion while pursuing our goal that we announced last quarter of attaining the leverage ratio of 2.5x total debt to EBITDA by the end of next year. That goal will be facilitated by the recent approval from our Board of Directors to authorize an additional stock repurchase program of $2 billion. 
In summary, as you can see from our updated guidance, we remain bullish on our growth prospects for both the U.S. and our Latin American businesses. Although the economy and competitive landscapes continue to be challenging, we're building on strong operating momentum. We're just now frankly starting to capture some of the benefits related to a few of the key initiatives that we implemented earlier this year. Or perhaps even more exciting, I think, are the many great ideas that are coming out of our strategic reviews that I believe position us well and provide the potential to further boost our growth in both the U.S. and Latin America for many years to come. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill for some comments about our Latin American businesses."
29614,109483364,72538,"DIRECTV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

As you saw from the release this morning, the World Cup impact on our business was everything we expected it to be and then some. The 660,000 growth additions and the 415,000 net additions easily broke previous records and our average monthly churn rate of 1.63% was the lowest second quarter rate in three years. 
The results are strong across the entire region, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, where all three countries experienced a roughly fourfold increase in net additions compared to last year. Argentina's net additions were more than doubled. Our prepaid services continued to gain traction across the region, but the vast majority of our growth came in postpaid. Approximately 80% of total gross adds in the quarter were for postpaid packages, similar to the second quarter of 2009, as well as the first quarter of this year. The point of reference, prepaid subscribers currently make up approximately 10% of our 5.2 million consolidated subscribers. Much of the growth we're seeing in postpaid packages is being driven by the sale of advanced services. About 30% of our gross adds signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter or roughly double the penetration level of the year ago. And from an absolute perspective, the number of gross adds taking advanced products with nearly 4x that of the second quarter of 2009. 
HD continues to fuel much of the growth in advanced services as well. Brazil continues to have the greatest HD penetration in the region due to the fact that we offer 3x as many HD channels than anyone else in the market. However, we're now seeing very strong HD demand in PanAmericana as well, particularly in Argentina. When you combine HD and standard definition DVR sales together, we're now seeing over 40% of our new subscribers in PanAmericana signing up for one or the other of these advanced products. 
Our monthly churn rate also greatly benefited from the World Cup as postpaid churn fell 14 basis points than a year ago to 1.45%. In addition to the strong subscriber results in the quarter, our financial results were also very solid. The 26% increase in revenues was mostly due to subscriber growth, and we also saw some favorable pricing trends in the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU growth would have been around 6% driven by price increases, higher sales of advanced services and lower promotional discounting, thanks to the World Cup. OPBDA was also very solid as it increased 66% over last year's results. Majority of the growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenue as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela. These improvements were partially offset by higher subscription acquisition costs related to the record gross additions. Subscriber-related CapEx on the new additions increased by over $15 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May, the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of the so-called parallel market for converting bolivar to U.S. dollars. This move restricted our ability to repatriate dollars, which partially explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. However, the amount of cash on hand in Venezuela is quite modest, reflecting the fact that we had been very aggressive in pulling cash out prior to the change in regulation. The currency-control situation in Venezuela remains fluid, and obviously, one we will continue to monitor. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can. 
To wrap up my discussion on the quarter, I would like to touch briefly about the results on Mexico, which we do not consolidate. Those of you in the call with Televisa last month, you know that Sky Mexico also benefited significantly from the World Cup, adding 251,000 subscribers in the quarter compared with only 9,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 7.6 million subscribers. Revenue and OPBDA growth of 26% and 21%, respectively, were also very strong in Sky Mexico. 
In summary then, it was a very strong and balanced quarter. We had good operating results from all three platforms, a good mix of product sales and strong financials across the board. 
Moving on to our full year outlook. With the strong first-half behind us, it's now a good time to update our full year guidance. In terms of subscribers, we now expect to add approximately 1 million subscribers this year or roughly the same as the entire U.S. pay-TV industry expects to add this year as well. I expect the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third given normal seasonality, and the fact that the timing of the World Cup, no doubt, accelerated some sales into the second quarter from the third. And as we've talked about on the last call, we remain very focused on keeping churn under control after such tremendous growth over the last several quarters particularly in the prepaid service. 
Moving on to revenue, growth is up nearly 30% year-to-date, but we will be facing tougher comparisons over the remainder of the year. In the first half of this year, the favorable year-on-year comparison for the Brazilian KI helped mask the negative effect of the devaluation in Venezuela. This will not be the case for the second half of the year. However, combining our strong first half revenues with what is likely to be a slower growing second half, yields a full year revenue growth target of between 15% and 20%, which is substantially higher than our original revenue growth guidance of about 10%. 
OPBDA also faces more difficult comparisons in the second half, but we'll benefit from the solid revenue growth and lower transaction charges in Venezuela. Therefore, consolidated OPBDA should grow approximately 45% for the year to about USD $1 billion. 
And finally, many of you are aware that our partner, Globo, has exercised its right under our shareholder's agreement to sell 19% of its 26% interest in Sky Brazil to us. We are currently working through the process that was agreed to in 2004 to determine the fair value of Sky Brazil, and we expect to close this transaction in the next few months. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat."
29614,109483364,72538,"DIRECTV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, I thought our U.S. business also had an extremely strong quarter, highlighted by solid revenue, earning and cash flow growth.

Much like Latin America, I thought our U.S. business also had an extremely strong quarter, highlighted by solid revenue, earning and cash flow growth. 
Looking first at the top line, revenue growth of 9% was solid and was driven mostly by ARPU growth of 5.7%, which at $87.90 was a bit higher than our internal target. Premiums, Pay Per View and advertising sales were particularly strong in the quarter. For the first time in several years, our year-over-year buy rates increased for premium movie channels. Although some of this improvement reflects the low buy rates from a year ago, a significant portion of the growth relates to superior execution by our marketing and call center teams. 
In addition to premiums, we also saw a solid year-over-year growth in Pay Per View movies, as well as higher Pay Per View event revenue, boosted by the Mayweather-Mosley fight in May. Finally, advertising sales were up almost 20% as we posted our best second quarter ever. 
Much like ARPU, net subscriber additions of 100,000 were also a touch better than our internal projections due to solid execution, but also from some of the promotions we've introduced such as Free HD. 
Our direct sales and retail sales channels have been performing better, which is offsetting the continued decline from our telco partners. Last year, telcos reached as high as 25% of gross additions while their contributions now are running five to 10 percentage points lower than those rate. As we've discussed on the last earnings call, this decline is related to several factors including the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse, as well as the decline in their landlines, which result in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at their call centers. 
Looking forward, we certainly expect that our new partnership with CenturyLink will boost sales in the telco channel. For those of you who may not be familiar with CenturyLink, they are currently the fourth largest telco, and upon completing their pending transaction with Qwest, they will become the third largest. They currently cover around 5 million homes in 33 states, so this is a very exciting opportunity for us. 
We're also pleased with our monthly churn rate of 1.51%, which for first time in five quarters, did not increase on a year-over-year basis. We're now managing churn in a much more segmented and targeted fashion, with a particularly sharp eye on those higher-valued subscribers who have the greater chance of voluntarily leaving DIRECTV. A good example would include customers rolling off of their two-year commitments in U-verse or FiOS territory. One could also argue that we're now much closer to the so-called sweet spot of balancing churn with retention spending. 
You've heard us say several times last year that we may have been spending a bit too much to save subscribers, particularly lower valued subscribers. As a result, over the past year, you've seen our retention spending declined modestly while churn increased modestly. Keep in mind, however, that this balance is highly sensitive to the competitive and economic landscape, so it's imperative that we continue to refine our policies accordingly. 
Turning now to the bottom line, we continue to grow both our Pre-SAC and OPBDA margins in the quarter. Similar to recent quarters, we did a good job managing our programming, subscriber services and upgrade and retention costs. However, G&A and SAC costs were higher both sequentially and compared to last year. The year-over-year and sequential increase in G&A was almost entirely due to one-time items and a slightly higher bad debt rate. The one-time items included higher legal expenses in the current quarter and lower expense a year ago related to the forfeiture of Chase's compensation benefits when he left the company. 
In terms of the year-over-year increase in SAC, roughly 2/3 of that increase was driven by the penetration growth in advanced products. We already lead the industry in sales of HD and DVR services. However, we're seeing our advanced penetration increase even further due to some of our new services and promotions. For example, our new Whole-Home DVR service requires customers to leave HD DVR equipment, which by the way, also requires our newer SWiM dish, both of which are more expensive than standard equipment. In addition, our free HD offer has been driving higher HD activation. We are comfortable making these investments in SAC because many of our new services, including Whole-Home DVR, generate incremental revenue streams for us. In many cases, these investments also improve efficiencies or lower costs. 
Our SWiM dish investment illustrates this point well as it reduces labor costs by simplifying the installation, while at the same time improving the installation experience for the customer. It also reduces future upgrade costs by making it easier to drop ship receivers, if a customer chooses to upgrade equipment after activation. And it improves diagnostics of the equipment and avoid unnecessary truck rolls in the future. 
It's also important to point out that customers with HD and DVR services continue to have substantially higher ARPU and lower churn than customers with only basic equipment. Separately, we had a modest increase in capital expenditures in the quarter due to mostly satellite payments for our newest satellite DIRECTV 14. 
Adding it all up, DIRECTV U.S. grew cash flow before interest and taxes by 27% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date growth rate to 40%. 
I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our outlook. You just heard Bruce's update on DIRECTV Latin America's outlook. So these comments apply to our U.S. business. 
Our strong first-half results provide us with greater confidence that we will meet or exceed all of DIRECTV U.S.'s full year guidance provided earlier in the year. When comparing the second half of the year to the first half, we're looking for better year-over-year comparisons for both gross additions and churn. We continue to expect that the quarterly revenue and OPBDA growth profile this year will be, in many ways, the opposite of last year's results. You may recall that last year's revenue and OPBDA growth in the U.S. improved as the year progressed. Obviously, that profile impacts our growth rates this year. 
In terms of consolidated free cash flow at DIRECTV, we are currently holding to our free cash flow growth target. Although we are well ahead of our goal on a year-to-date basis, much like with revenue and OPBDA, we will be dealing with tougher comparisons in the second half. Furthermore, we must be mindful of the impact that higher-than-planned gross additions may have on our near-term free cash flow. 
Regarding our strategy for returning capital to shareholders, through yesterday, we had repurchased approximately 2.8 billion out of our 3.5 billion authorization. As you saw in the earnings release, our Board approved an additional 2 billion increase to that authorization, leaving us with about 2.7 billion for future buybacks, which should cover us for the next several months. We look forward to tapping into what is currently a relatively strong debt market as we continue on our goal of achieving a 2.5x leverage ratio by the end of next year. So at this time, I'm going to turn the call back to Jon so that we can begin the Q&A session"

So again, we don't have a set target. But I think if you kind of look at our past run rate, it should be fairly indicative of how you would see us going forward."

And I would say, while we'll opportunistically continue to be open to ideas in emerging markets, our focus is Latin America. I think if there was one takeaway from the work we did, where we looked extensively at markets from China to India to Russia to Middle East, is that ours is a highly-regulated industry. We actually don't have that many regions of the world where you can own 100% of your business, where you actually have quality programming that consumers are willing to pay for, particularly sports. And where you got enough economies of scale over two languages, Spanish and Portuguese, that you can build. And lastly, that you've got a very, very talented and streetsmart operating team. So I would say we'll continue to opportunistically look outside of Latin America, but I don't see any imminent significant investments that we'd be making at this time. I think our focus is on Latin America, and Bruce has pulled together a very, very exciting strategic plan for that region and frankly, we continue to see strong growth potential primarily because of the low penetration rates that you still see for pay TV in Latin America."

I mean, in the quarter, the uptick that you might have seen there would've been driven by premium channels, stuff like that. As we look at programming costs overall, we continue to manage them effectively. But they continue to create pressure overall on the P&L. I think as I look into the future, I still believe we can manage through things like retrans and other things. But I have to point out that we've got kind of a catch-up accounting on our NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract this year that is kind of creating some profits with a different kind of contract next year. So let's put how we deal with the NFL new contract as a separate item. We haven't yet made any decisions on how we're looking at next year in that regard, but certainly, that's going to create some significant one-time pressure on programming costs for 2011. That's, in my judgment, a separate issue from the rest. And on the rest, I think it continues to be a challenge, I think, for the industry as a whole, but we continue to work to manage through it. And frankly, we'd have to pass pricing to our customers to cover those programming costs increases in future. I think in terms of TV Everywhere, we have got, in laying out our strategy with our board, we've got a whole group of folks working on DIRECTV ideas. From a programming standpoint. We discussed digital rights and authentication in every one of our kind of programming contract renewals. It's a first topic for discussion in many ways. We've got our DVR schedule, that's doing very well. Probably our most imminent next opportunity is the NFL SUNDAY TICKET To-Go for $50. You got a fantastic experience on an iPad, I can tell you that, I'd seen it. I think beyond that, in my own view on TV Everywhere, when you look at it outside the home, it's going to be a journey. I mean each of the media companies has a slightly different take on it as to what content they would make available and when. We just want to make sure we're positioned well to provide our DIRECTV customers with a fantastic experience. So we're working on a number of things that will talk about at our Investor Day from a strategies standpoint to kind of bring our content to a mobile device for our consumers next year and in the years ahead. So it's one of the five priorities that we've got in addition to kind of the connected-home experience and some other areas that we'll talk about at the Investor Day."

Our board was wondering whether I was going to ask for content rights to appear on future television shows, I don't think there's any danger of that. On the first question on pricing, look, ours is a very competitive industry. And as I said, I don't think we ought to focus on one individual competitor. Because frankly, we've seen a ramp-up in competitive activity over the last year, pretty much across the board, with the aggressiveness of the telcos as well as the other satellite companies. So I can't say whether -- I mean I wouldn't try and characterize the quarter as more or less of that. I just say it continues to be very, very competitive out there. I think consumers are still very price sensitive or value sensitive, I should say, and so our thinking here is we need to continue to be competitive in the services we provide customers. Now we're trying to do it in a very segmented and targeted way. So that we tackle these issues and try and figure out how do we continue to earn the loyalty of our existing subscribers, most importantly, and second, what do we need to do in tailoring our offers to ensure that it's competitive going forward. Our focus on Q3 is all around NFL SUNDAY TICKET. We've got a terrific program. Frankly, as we look on SUNDAY TICKET at the SuperFan thing that we had last year, I just didn't think that given what we asked consumers to pay for, it just didn't seem to me that there was enough value add to not provide HD as a part of that package. So that was probably more driven by just kind of a view of what's right for the customer than it was necessarily a competitive consideration. Certainly, the FREE HD was a competitive consideration, and we'll continue to look at that. Frankly, we'll monitor the competitive situation by quarter and make our decisions accordingly, but we're prepared to stay competitive and ensure that we continue to gain high-quality subs. And as you saw, I think one of the most important things was that we're so far able to manage through this in terms of generating good financial performance, while at the same time being very competitive in gaining net additions of 100,000, and by the way, very high quality adds. I mean we had record numbers of -- and HD DVR was 38% in the quarter, which is above -- it was 25% a year ago. So I mean very, very good trajectory for where we're trying to take our customers. In terms of content, look, I've said this before, and I think I'd probably continue to feel that we'll always be open and opportunistic if we look at tuck-under-content ideas. We just signed damages for the 101 channel. We'll continue to look at sports for opportunities, but it certainly don't see a big content acquisition in our future at this time."

Having said that, I would probably say that the opportunity in Latin America is much more wide open. I don't believe that in Latin America, we will see similar competitive pressure from something like a big fibre build out to the home that you've seen here in the U.S. As challenging as those economics are in United States, they're even more challenging in Latin America.

I think it's a $3.50 for this coming season, and whether you're going to try to roll that out more broadly than just New York City?"

You'll get a little peek into how we're thinking",535,"Sure. On the first question, on user interface, it's a whole connected-home strategy. You'll be seeing a lot of work coming on our user interface both later this year when you see the new Cinema interface. You'll get a little peek into how we're thinking about user interface, but I can tell you that we're not standing still. Well, I don't think you can stand still in our business. The world's constantly changing, and you got to run faster. And I'm very excited about some of the work that Romulo Pontual's engineering team is doing in looking at some significant improvements in our user interface next year. We're working on ways to increase the speed for changing the channel. We're looking at picture in picture. We're looking at how you personalize potentially the interface to your TV. We're looking at recommendation software. We already have the best smart search, the best search engine out there. I think there's lots more that we can do with our user interface that you'll be seeing over the next 18 to 24 months, I would say, that I'm very excited about, and it's a big priority for us as part of our connected-home strategy. On the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, we did the Manhattan thing a year ago. We didn't get a huge take on it, frankly. I'm not sure whether that was just that there's not much demand for it or whether we didn't market it as well as we might. We're going to extend it a bit this year, and we'll see what we learn this year. I think, certainly, as we look beyond this year, it's kind of late to go in and try wholesale change things. But as we look beyond this year, we continue to look for ideas for ways to monetize our NFL SUNDAY TICKET rights to help pay for the contract, and there are number of ideas that is probably a little premature for me to talk about as we're really not sure yet which next idea we might chase as we look at ways to provide that experience to more customers. So I think for this year, we'll take that Manhattan test a little bit further, make it available on a national basis. Let's see what kind of a take we get, but it's a bit of a slippery slope on the pricing part of it because -- I mean if I'm controlling it, we're out to see. I mean it's a little bit of one that -- we got to see how much of a demand there is. I'm not convinced, frankly, from a price elasticity standpoint that if I price it $300 to $350, it would make that much difference in the number of subscribers. And to price it much below that, I'd undercut them either mine or existing 2 million customers that take in NFL SUNDAY TICKET. So I would say we're in a learning mode on that. But rest assured, it is an area that we're looking at and try to figure out what the right next step would be, which I think you'd more likely see anything more aggressive we would do next season, not this season."

Second, just the market alone, you got a rising middle class in many of those markets down there that's going to generate significant additional customers for us, as you see kind of the middle class increasing down there and the upper middle class. We're certainly looking at segmentation down there, recognizing that we need to service the high end with the same kind of HD experience that we offer in the U.S. At the same time, we recognize to service kind of, lets call it, the middle class or lower middle class, you need a more affordable offering. And that's part of what's been so successful for us this year, whether it's our Sky Digital Lite package in Brazil or whether it's our prepaid packages that we've had out there. So I think we're going to continue to segment. That's not to be confused with we're trying to chase the bottom of the pyramid. I don't think, at this point, we're focused on that, but it's really how do you make sure that you got a compelling offer for the middle class and ability to upgrade them. And I also think, whether it is broadband or whether it's content, given the strength of our competitive position in Latin America, we're certainly more open, I would say, to out-of-the-box ideas or investments are acquisitions if they were to come along than probably a more mature market like the U.S. But I don't necessarily say that, therefore, we're going to do something, I just -- we're more open minded, given what I think we've got to leverage down there. On the NFL lockout, look, I think it's way premature to talk about that. I think we've been clear that there are provisions in our contract where if there are games that get canceled, we get something back for that, either in a longer contract or whatever. I think probably when we get towards the end of this year and we talk about how we're planning for next year, we can talk a little bit more about it at that time, but I'd say it's bit premature."

Overall, I thought our second quarter results in both the United States and Latin America were very strong and reflects solid execution of our key three core strategies for creating shareholder value. 
First, we're generating very solid topline growth, driven by the strength of our brand, as well as an unrivaled suite of compelling products and services. In that regard, DIRECTV's consolidated revenue growth of 12% leads the industry and is due in large part to our company's portfolio of businesses all across the Americas, reflecting diverse geographies, demographics and growth profiles. 
Second, of course, our traditional focus on operating excellence, which is driving strong margins and cash flow growth. There, both of our U.S. and Latin American businesses grew their margins in the second quarter. Our earnings per share increased 50% excluding the impact from the Malone transaction, and our year-to-date free cash flow was up 40% to $1.4 billion. 
And third, as we spoke to you on our last call, we're continuing to execute our strategy of aggressively returning capital to shareholders. As you saw in the earnings release, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of stock in the second quarter, representing one of the largest quarterly share buybacks in our history. 
Now before turning the call over to Pat and Bruce for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin America businesses, let me just offer a few observations. First, starting with Latin America. While, clearly, we expected a strong quarter, I think it's fair to say that net additions of 415,000 exceeded all of our expectations. And to put that number into perspective, it was more than 3x the net additions of a year ago and over 60% higher than our previous record set just two quarters ago. The FIFA World Cup, coupled with a relatively strong macroeconomic landscape, propelled a lot of that growth. But we're also continuing to see very solid momentum across the entire region driven by our industry-leading HD and DVR services, as well as popular postpaid and prepaid packages. 
I was also extremely pleased to see that even with that rapid subscriber growth, Bruce and his team were able to significantly increase their operating profit before depreciation and amortization, and the margins by over seven percentage points to almost 31%. 
Now I think we also had a very solid results with our U.S. business. Furthermore, we saw some key trends develop in the quarter, particularly in the areas of both subscriber and ARPU growth that, I believe, position us well for the second half of the year. 
Our net additions of 100,000 were a touch better than our expectations. But importantly, gross adds and churns strengthened throughout the quarter. We're becoming much more targeted in our marketing strategies as well as our new promotions, which is enabling us to drive higher gross additions with much greater penetration of both HD and DVR services. Due in part to our free HD offer, which was introduced at the end of the quarter, we reached a record high penetration level of over 70% in the quarter for new subscribers activating with advanced services. So they're very high-quality subscribers. 
We're also very excited about the additional demand that will be generated through our new partnership with CenturyLink, which was officially launched just this past Sunday, and we're off to a terrific start already taking orders. I might also add that we have exclusive distribution in 12 out of the 13 states that Frontier operates in, and we have an excellent partnership with them as well. 
In addition to growing demand for new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job of retaining existing subscribers. Our monthly churn rate of 1.51% was equal to prior-year's second quarter, breaking a five-quarter trend of higher year-over-year churn rates. 
Much like our strategy with gross additions, we're taking a much more targeted approach to managing churn through improved segmentation. And as a result, we saw a reduction in voluntary churn for the first time in nine quarters. I believe this decline is also due to our improved customer service and boxed reliability efforts. 
ARPU growth was an equally strong story in the quarter. The favorable trends that we talked about on our last earnings call, particularly regarding premiums, Pay Per View and advertising continued in the second quarter, and in some cases, strengthened even further. Premium movie revenues generated the largest favorability to our expectations in prior year. But we're also seeing very solid results in Pay Per View, movies and events. In addition, advertising revenues were very strong as we posted the best second quarter in our history. 
Moving now to the bottom line, I was pleased with the nearly one percentage point increase in our DIRECTV U.S. operating profit before depreciation, amortization margin to over 28%, representing our highest margin in two years. We're continuing to execute well in areas such as programming, subscriber services and upgrade and retention marketing. 
Our SAC was a bit higher than we would've liked. However, I must point out that most of that increase is related to business decisions that we consciously made to provide our customers with advanced equipment, which improves both long-term customer loyalty, as well as topline growth. 
For instance, roughly 2/3 of the year-over-year increase in SACs for the quarter was due to the higher penetration of advanced services that I mentioned earlier, as well as additional investment that we announced late last year related to new services such as our Whole-Home DVR. As a point of reference, we saw our HD penetration rate increase almost 50% after we launched our free HD offer to new consumers. 
We'll continue to make these investments in a financially prudent fashion to ensure that we capture the appropriate returns. It's no coincidence that many of the favorable ARPU and churn trends discussed earlier relate to the increased SAC investment we've made in previous quarters. 
Now before turning the call over to Bruce for some remarks about Latin America, let me just wrap up with an update on a couple of other important items and an overview of our key priorities for the second half of the year. First, we're making terrific progress in our company-wide strategic review. Earlier this week, we had a chance to have a very constructive two-day strategic retreat with our Board of Directors, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you in the fall at our Investor Day. 
We're also making very good progress on adding new Board members. Last month, I was delighted to be able to add Sam DiPiazza to our Board. I've known Sam a long time. He brings a wealth of experience and expertise, and most recently served as the Global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers International from 2002 to 2009. We're working hard to continue to fill the remaining Board seats, and we hope to land a couple more Directors before year end. 
In terms of my top priorities for the second half, I guess I'd go back to the opening comments I made about our core strategies for creating growth and shareholder value. First, we need to continue to reinvigorate growth at the top line by delivering on our goal of making DIRECTV the best video experience in the world. Specifically in the second half, that includes building on and extending our industry-leading position in HD, 3D and mobile sports. 
As you may have noticed, last quarter, we launched three dedicated 3D channels and added 30 new HD channels for the extra capacity provided by our new satellite. We've also just launched our popular NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion with more value and features than ever before and a terrific ad campaign, and I'm very excited about that. 
We are now including all of the services that used to be part of our SuperFan package, including games in HD and the Game Mix and Red Zone Channels at no extra charge to our customers. And we're also introducing an NFL SUNDAY TICKET To-Go service for about $50, which will provide live-streaming video of the games on mobile devices like the iPad or via a computer through directv.com. 
Also in the second half, we intend to increase penetration of new services, such as our Whole-Home DVR, as well as services requiring an Internet connection to our receivers. And later this year, we'll introduce a greatly enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service that's designed to not only take share from other movie services, but most importantly, to significantly improve the overall movie experience for all of our DIRECTV customers. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we'll continue refining and improving our segmentation strategies for how we acquire and retain customers so that we optimize our subscriber growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to have a heightened focus on increasing productivity, operational excellence and driving operating efficiencies. Whether these come in G&A, our call centers, our installation network or anywhere else across our enterprise, it's critical that we strive for operating excellence to counter out some of the cost pressures that we've seen in areas, such as SAC and overall programming expense. 
And finally, we'll continue to repurchase stock in an aggressive fashion while pursuing our goal that we announced last quarter of attaining a leverage ratio of 2.5x total debt to EBITDA by the end of next year. That goal will be facilitated by the recent approval from our Board of Directors to authorize an additional stock repurchase program of $2 billion. 
In summary, as you can see from our updated guidance, we remain bullish on our growth prospects for both the U.S. and our Latin American businesses. Although the economy and competitive landscapes continue to be challenging, we're building on strong operating momentum. We're just now frankly starting to capture some of the benefits related to a few of the key initiatives that we implemented earlier this year. Or perhaps even more exciting, I think, are the many great ideas that are coming out of our strategic reviews that I believe position us well and provide the potential to further boost our growth in both the U.S. and Latin America for many years to come. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill for some comments about our Latin American businesses."
29614,109483364,72583,"DIRECTV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike. As you saw from the release this morning, the World Cup impact on our business was everything we expected it to be and then some. 660,000 growth additions and the 415,000 net additions easily broke previous records and our average monthly ch",1059,"Thanks, Mike. As you saw from the release this morning, the World Cup impact on our business was everything we expected it to be and then some. 660,000 growth additions and the 415,000 net additions easily broke previous records and our average monthly churn rate of 1.63% was the lowest second quarter rate in three years. 
The results are strong across the entire region, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, where all three countries experienced a roughly fourfold increase in net additions compared to last year. Argentina's net additions were more than double. 
Our prepaid services continued to gain traction across the region, but the vast majority of our growth came in postpaid. Approximately 80% of total gross adds in the quarter were for postpaid packages, similar to the second quarter of 2009, as well as the first quarter of this year. 
The point of reference, prepaid subscribers currently make up approximately 10% of our 5.2 million consolidated subscribers. Much of the growth we're seeing in postpaid packages is being driven by the sale of advanced services. About 30% of our gross adds signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter or roughly double the penetration level of the year ago. And from an absolute perspective, the number of gross adds taking advanced products was nearly 4x that of the second quarter of 2009. 
HD continues to fuel much of the growth in advanced services as well. Brazil continues to have the greatest HD penetration in the region due to the fact that we offer 3x as many HD channels than anyone else in the market. However, we're now seeing very strong HD demand in PanAmericana as well, particularly in Argentina. When you combine HD and standard definition DVR sales together, we're now seeing over 40% of our new subscribers in PanAmericana signing up for one or the other of these advanced products. 
Our monthly churn rate also greatly benefited from the World Cup as postpaid churn fell 14 basis points from a year ago to 1.45%. In addition to the strong subscriber results in the quarter, our financial results were also very solid. The 26% increase in revenues was mostly due to subscriber growth, and we also saw some favorable pricing trends in the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU growth would have been around 6% driven by price increases, higher sales of advanced services and lower promotional discounting, thanks to the World Cup. OPBDA was also very solid as it increased 66% over last year's results. Majority of the growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenue as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela. 
These improvements were partially offset by higher subscription acquisition costs related to the record gross additions. Subscriber-related CapEx on the new additions increased by over $15 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May, the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of the so-called parallel market for converting bolivar to U.S. dollars. This move restricted our ability to repatriate dollars, which partially explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. 
However, the amount of cash on hand in Venezuela is quite modest, reflecting the fact that we had been very aggressive in pulling cash out prior to the change in regulation. The currency-control situation in Venezuela remains fluid, and obviously, one we will continue to monitor. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can. 
To wrap up my discussion on the quarter, I would like to touch briefly about the results of Sky Mexico, which we do not consolidate. Those of you in the call with Televisa last month, you know that Sky Mexico also benefited significantly from the World Cup, adding 251,000 subscribers in the quarter compared with only 9,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 7.6 million subscribers. Revenue and OPBDA growth of 26% and 21%, respectively, were also very strong in Sky Mexico. 
In summary then, it was a very strong and balanced quarter. We had good operating results from all three platforms, a good mix of product sales and strong financials across the board. 
Moving on to our full year outlook. With the strong first-half behind us, it's now a good time to update our full year guidance. In terms of subscribers, we now expect to add approximately 1 million subscribers this year or roughly the same as the entire U.S. pay-TV industry expects to add this year as well. I expect the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third given normal seasonality, and the fact that the timing of the World Cup, no doubt, accelerated some sales into the second quarter from the third. And as we've talked about on the last call, we remain very focused on keeping churn under control after such tremendous growth over the last several quarters particularly in the prepaid service. 
Moving on to revenue, growth is up nearly 30% year-to-date, but we will be facing tougher comparisons over the remainder of the year. In the first half of this year, the favorable year-on-year comparison for the Brazilian KI helped mask the negative effect of the devaluation in Venezuela. This will not be the case for the second half of the year. However, combining our strong first half revenues with what is likely to be a slower growing second half, yields a full year revenue growth target of between 15% and 20%, which is substantially higher than our original revenue growth guidance of about 10%. 
OPBDA also faces more difficult comparisons in the second half, but we'll benefit from the solid revenue growth and lower transaction charges in Venezuela. Therefore, consolidated OPBDA should grow approximately 45% for the year to about USD $1 billion. 
And finally, many of you are aware that our partner, Globo, has exercised its right under our shareholder's agreement to sell 19% of its 26% interest in Sky Brazil to us. We are currently working through the process that was agreed to in 2004 to determine the fair value of Sky Brazil, and we expect to close this transaction in the next few months. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat."
29614,109483364,72583,"DIRECTV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, I thought our U.S. business also had an extremely strong quarter, highlighted by solid revenue, earning and cash flow growth.

Much like Latin America, I thought our U.S. business also had an extremely strong quarter, highlighted by solid revenue, earning and cash flow growth. 
Looking first at the top line, revenue growth of 9% was solid and was driven mostly by ARPU growth of 5.7%, which at $87.90 was a bit higher than our internal target. Premiums, Pay Per View and advertising sales were particularly strong in the quarter. For the first time in several years, our year-over-year buy rates increased for premium movie channels. Although some of this improvement reflects the low buy rates from a year ago, a significant portion of the growth relates to superior execution by our marketing and call center teams. 
In addition to premiums, we also saw a solid year-over-year growth in Pay Per View movies, as well as higher Pay Per View event revenue, boosted by the Mayweather-Mosley fight in May. Finally, advertising sales were up almost 20% as we posted our best second quarter ever. 
Much like ARPU, net subscriber additions of 100,000 were also a touch better than our internal projections due to solid execution, but also from some of the promotions we've introduced such as Free HD. 
Our direct sales and retail sales channels have been performing better, which is offsetting the continued decline from our telco partners. Last year, telcos reached as high as 25% of gross additions while their contributions now are running five to 10 percentage points lower than those rate. As we've discussed on the last earnings call, this decline is related to several factors including the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse, as well as the decline in their landlines, which result in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at their call centers. 
Looking forward, we certainly expect that our new partnership with CenturyLink will boost sales in the telco channel. For those of you who may not be familiar with CenturyLink, they are currently the fourth largest telco, and upon completing their pending transaction with Qwest, they will become the third largest. They currently cover around 5 million homes in 33 states, so this is a very exciting opportunity for us. 
We're also pleased with our monthly churn rate of 1.51%, which for first time in five quarters, did not increase on a year-over-year basis. We're now managing churn in a much more segmented and targeted fashion, with a particularly sharp eye on those higher-valued subscribers who have the greater chance of voluntarily leaving DIRECTV. A good example would include customers rolling off of their two-year commitments in U-verse or FiOS territory. One could also argue that we're now much closer to the so-called sweet spot of balancing churn with retention spending. 
You've heard us say several times last year that we may have been spending a bit too much to save subscribers, particularly lower valued subscribers. As a result, over the past year, you've seen our retention spending declined modestly while churn increased modestly. Keep in mind, however, that this balance is highly sensitive to the competitive and economic landscape, so it's imperative that we continue to refine our policies accordingly. 
Turning now to the bottom line, we continue to grow both our Pre-SAC and OPBDA margins in the quarter. Similar to recent quarters, we did a good job managing our programming, subscriber services and upgrade and retention costs. However, G&A and SAC costs were higher both sequentially and compared to last year. The year-over-year and sequential increase in G&A was almost entirely due to one-time items and a slightly higher bad debt rate. The one-time items included higher legal expenses in the current quarter and lower expense a year ago related to the forfeiture of Chase's compensation benefits when he left the company. 
In terms of the year-over-year increase in SAC, roughly 2/3 of that increase was driven by the penetration growth in advanced products. We already lead the industry in sales of HD and DVR services. However, we're seeing our advanced penetration increase even further due to some of our new services and promotions. For example, our new Whole-Home DVR service requires customers to leave HD DVR equipment, which by the way, also requires our newer SWiM dish, both of which are more expensive than standard equipment. In addition, our free HD offer has been driving higher HD activation. We are comfortable making these investments in SAC because many of our new services, including Whole-Home DVR, generate incremental revenue streams for us. In many cases, these investments also improve efficiencies or lower costs. 
Our SWiM dish investment illustrates this point well as it reduces labor costs by simplifying the installation, while at the same time improving the installation experience for the customer. It also reduces future upgrade costs by making it easier to drop ship receivers, if a customer chooses to upgrade equipment after activation. And it improves diagnostics of the equipment and avoid unnecessary truck rolls in the future. 
It's also important to point out that customers with HD and DVR services continue to have substantially higher ARPU and lower churn than customers with only basic equipment. Separately, we had a modest increase in capital expenditures in the quarter due to mostly satellite payments for our newest satellite DIRECTV 14. 
Adding it all up, DIRECTV U.S. grew cash flow before interest and taxes by 27% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date growth rate to 40%. 
I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our outlook. You just heard Bruce's update on DIRECTV Latin America's outlook. So these comments apply to our U.S. business. 
Our strong first-half results provide us with greater confidence that we will meet or exceed all of DIRECTV U.S.'s full year guidance provided earlier in the year. When comparing the second half of the year to the first half, we're looking for better year-over-year comparisons for both gross additions and churn. We continue to expect that the quarterly revenue and OPBDA growth profile this year will be, in many ways, the opposite of last year's results. You may recall that last year's revenue and OPBDA growth in the U.S. improved as the year progressed. Obviously, that profile impacts our growth rates this year. 
In terms of consolidated free cash flow at DIRECTV, we are currently holding to our free cash flow growth target. Although we are well ahead of our goal on a year-to-date basis, much like with revenue and OPBDA, we will be dealing with tougher comparisons in the second half. Furthermore, we must be mindful of the impact that higher-than-planned gross additions may have on our near-term free cash flow. 
Regarding our strategy for returning capital to shareholders, through yesterday, we had repurchased approximately 2.8 billion out of our 3.5 billion authorization. As you saw in the earnings release, our Board approved an additional 2 billion increase to that authorization, leaving us with about 2.7 billion for future buybacks, which should cover us for the next several months. We look forward to tapping into what is currently a relatively strong debt market as we continue on our goal of achieving a 2.5x leverage ratio by the end of next year. So at this time, I'm going to turn the call back to Jon so that we can begin the Q&A session"

I think if there was one takeaway from the work we did, where we looked extensively at markets from China to India to Russia to Middle East, is that ours is a highly-regulated industry. We actually don't have that many regions of the world where you can own 100% of your business, where you actually have quality programming that consumers are willing to pay for, particularly sports. And where you got enough economies of scale over two languages, Spanish and Portuguese, that you can build. And lastly, that you've got a very, very talented and streetsmart operating team. So I would say we'll continue to opportunistically look outside of Latin America, but I don't see any imminent significant investments that we'd be making at this time. I think our focus is on Latin America, and Bruce has pulled together a very, very exciting strategic plan for that region and frankly, we continue to see strong growth potential primarily because of the low penetration rates that you still see for pay TV in Latin America."

I mean, in the quarter, the uptick that you might have seen there would've been driven by premium channels, stuff like that. As we look at programming costs overall, we continue to manage them effectively. But they continue to create pressure overall on the P&L. I think as I look into the future, I still believe we can manage through things like retrans and other things. But I have to point out that we've got kind of a catch-up accounting on our NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract this year that is kind of creating some profits with a different kind of contract next year. So let's put how we deal with the NFL new contract as a separate item. We haven't yet made any decisions on how we're looking at next year in that regard, but certainly, that's going to create some significant one-time pressure on programming costs for 2011. That's, in my judgment, a separate issue from the rest. And on the rest, I think it continues to be a challenge, I think, for the industry as a whole, but we continue to work to manage through it. And frankly, we'd have to pass pricing to our customers to cover those programming costs increases in future. I think in terms of TV Everywhere, we have got, in laying out our strategy with our board, we've got a whole group of folks working on DIRECTV ideas. From a programming standpoint. We discussed digital rights and authentication in every one of our kind of programming contract renewals. It's a first topic for discussion in many ways. We've got our DVR schedule, that's doing very well. Probably our most imminent next opportunity is the NFL SUNDAY TICKET To-Go for $50. You got a fantastic experience on an iPad, I can tell you that, I'd seen it. I think beyond that, in my own view on TV Everywhere, when you look at it outside the home, it's going to be a journey. I mean each of the media companies has a slightly different take on it as to what content they would make available and when. We just want to make sure we're positioned well to provide our DIRECTV customers with a fantastic experience. So we're working on a number of things that will talk about at our Investor Day from a strategies standpoint to kind of bring our content to a mobile device for our consumers next year and in the years ahead. So it's one of the five priorities that we've got in addition to kind of the connected-home experience and some other areas that we'll talk about at the Investor Day."

And if I could sneak one more in, there's been a lot of question about DIRECTV acquiring content or more content exposure, and I know you're on Undercover Boss later this year. But I was wondering if there's anything more to some of the rumors flying around out there, maybe you could just address that."

Our board was wondering whether I was going to ask for content rights to appear on future television shows, I don't think there's any danger of that.

Our board was wondering whether I was going to ask for content rights to appear on future television shows, I don't think there's any danger of that. On the first question on pricing, look, ours is a very competitive industry. And as I said, I don't think we ought to focus on one individual competitor. Because frankly, we've seen a ramp-up in competitive activity over the last year, pretty much across the board, with the aggressiveness of the telcos as well as the other satellite companies. So I can't say whether -- I mean I wouldn't try and characterize the quarter as more or less of that. I just say it continues to be very, very competitive out there. I think consumers are still very price sensitive or value sensitive, I should say, and so our thinking here is we need to continue to be competitive in the services we provide customers. Now we're trying to do it in a very segmented and targeted way. So that we tackle these issues and try and figure out how do we continue to earn the loyalty of our existing subscribers, most importantly, and second, what do we need to do in tailoring our offers to ensure that it's competitive going forward. Our focus on Q3 is all around NFL SUNDAY TICKET. We've got a terrific program. Frankly, as we look on SUNDAY TICKET at the SuperFan thing that we had last year, I just didn't think that given what we asked consumers to pay for, it just didn't seem to me that there was enough value add to not provide HD as a part of that package. So that was probably more driven by just kind of a view of what's right for the customer than it was necessarily a competitive consideration. Certainly, the FREE HD was a competitive consideration, and we'll continue to look at that. Frankly, we'll monitor the competitive situation by quarter and make our decisions accordingly, but we're prepared to stay competitive and ensure that we continue to gain high-quality subs. And as you saw, I think one of the most important things was that we're so far able to manage through this in terms of generating good financial performance, while at the same time being very competitive in gaining net additions of 100,000, and by the way, very high quality adds. I mean we had record numbers of -- and HD DVR was 38% in the quarter, which is above -- it was 25% a year ago. So I mean very, very good trajectory for where we're trying to take our customers. In terms of content, look, I've said this before, and I think I'd probably continue to feel that we'll always be open and opportunistic if we look at tuck-under-content ideas. We just signed damages for the 101 channel. We'll continue to look at sports for opportunities, but it certainly don't see a big content acquisition in our future at this time."

I mean, I think in general, therefore, we will continue to ride it out the way we have in the United States and see where it goes. Having said that, I would probably say that the opportunity in Latin America is much more wide open. I don't believe that in Latin America, we will see similar competitive pressure from something like a big fiber build out to the home that you've seen here in the U.S. As challenging as those economics are in United States, they're even more challenging in Latin America. So the opportunity is more wide open. It evolves differently. My guess is it will be more mobile and wirelessly based as opposed to landline based, and I think we're well positioned to fight in that arena."

As I said in my notes, it's something that we're continuing to monitor and tweak effectiveness, but we're really gaining a lot of traction on that. And it's really -- the churn has really been more voluntary than anything else. On subs, yes, I think that we had a lot of good momentum in the quarter. As Mike said, I think when we responded in part on the HD for FREE, we put in some filters, but it resonated really well. And then we've launched our Whole-Home DVR early in June, and that was well received.

We see little bit too of just a mix, with the telcos were generally of lower overall SAC and has their volume declines and is replaced by retail and other channels, you get a little upward pressure there.

And we want the consumer to have an HD DVR, so they can get the full DIRECTV experience. The net neutrality debate, it's all tied up in what are you really talking about. Are you talking about discriminating on specific content? Or are you talking about not allowing pricing for heavy users? And frankly, on the latter point, I think, if 5% of the users are using 50% of the iPhone bandwidth, you got to find a way to price appropriately or you won't have -- I mean, capital won't invest.

On the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, we did the Manhattan thing a year ago. We didn't get a huge take on it, frankly. I'm not sure whether that was just that there's not much demand for it or whether we didn't market it as well as we might. We're going to extend it a bit this year, and we'll see what we learn this year. I think, certainly, as we look beyond this year, it's kind of late to go in and try wholesale change things. But as we look beyond this year, we continue to look for ideas for ways to monetize our NFL SUNDAY TICKET rights to help pay for the contract, and there are number of ideas that is probably a little premature for me to talk about as we're really not sure yet which next idea we might chase as we look at ways to provide that experience to more customers. So I think for this year, we'll take that Manhattan test a little bit further, make it available on a national basis. Let's see what kind of a take we get, but it's a bit of a slippery slope on the pricing part of it because -- I mean if I'm controlling it, we're out to see. I mean it's a little bit of one that -- we got to see how much of a demand there is. I'm not convinced, frankly, from a price elasticity standpoint that if I price it $300 to $350, it would make that much difference in the number of subscribers. And to price it much below that, I'd undercut them either mine or existing 2 million customers that take in NFL SUNDAY TICKET. So I would say we're in a learning mode on that. But rest assured, it is an area that we're looking at and try to figure out what the right next step would be, which I think you'd more likely see anything more aggressive we would do next season, not this season."

Second, just the market alone, you got a rising middle class in many of those markets down there that's going to generate significant additional customers for us, as you see kind of the middle class increasing down there and the upper middle class. We're certainly looking at segmentation down there, recognizing that we need to service the high end with the same kind of HD experience that we offer in the U.S. At the same time, we recognize to service, kind of, lets call it, the middle class or lower middle class, you need a more affordable offering. And that's part of what's been so successful for us this year, whether it's our Sky Digital Lite package in Brazil or whether it's our prepaid packages that we've had out there. So I think we're going to continue to segment. That's not to be confused with we're trying to chase the bottom of the pyramid. I don't think, at this point, we're focused on that, but it's really how do you make sure that you got a compelling offer for the middle class and ability to upgrade them. And I also think, whether it is broadband or whether it's content, given the strength of our competitive position in Latin America, we're certainly more open, I would say, to out-of-the-box ideas or investments or acquisitions if they were to come along than probably a more mature market like the U.S. But I don't necessarily say that, therefore, we're going to go do something, I just -- we're more open minded, given what I think we've got to leverage down there. On the NFL lockout, look, I think it's way premature to talk about that. I think we've been clear that there are provisions in our contract where if there are games that get canceled, we get something back for that, either in a longer contract or whatever. I think probably when we get towards the end of this year and we talk about how we're planning for next year, we can talk a little bit more about it at that time, but I'd say it's bit premature."

I'd like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce as is customary for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American bus",1354,"Thanks, John, thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce as is customary for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses. Overall though, I thought our third quarter results were certainly the best of the year, as we gain market share in both regions, North America and South America, while also maintaining very strong margins. My main takeaways from the quarter are: first, DIRECTV and Sky Light America's strong brands and differentiated content continued to drive greater consumer demand for our services, both in the United States and across Latin America. In addition to gaining share, our customers also are purchasing more HD, DVR and premium services, which contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our company.
Second, we're continuing to manage our cost effectively, capturing efficiencies and productivity improvements. Despite a 13% increase in consolidated gross additions, and related increase in acquisition cost, we still achieved double-digit OPBDA growth, and grew our earnings per share by 49% in the quarter.  And third, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet and returning the capital to shareholders by issuing $3 billion in debt and repurchasing $1.37 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date buybacks to $3.6 billion.
Let's first look at the DIRECTV U.S. business. I'm particularly pleased to see that as our year progressed, our subscriber momentum continues to build. In fact, our third quarter was the first time in six quarters where both our gross adds and our churn were better than prior year's period, resulting in a 28% increase in net additions to 174,000. Consumer demand for DIRECTV's services remains extremely strong for a couple of reasons. It's clear that some of our new products are resonating well with our customers. For instance, I mentioned at an investor conference a few weeks ago that our take rates for Whole-Home DVR services was running around 25% of gross adds. And recently, we've seen that number reach as high as 40% of new subscribers. We intend to keep that momentum going in the fourth quarter, with continued focus on our Multi-Room Viewing product, as well as relaunching our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service, and more aggressively connecting our most valuable subscribers receivers to the Internet.
We continue to believe that a set-top box connected to the Internet provides our customers with significantly more features and services, which in turn, will drive greater ARPU and lower churn. Another reason behind the strong demand we saw in the quarter is the popularity of our offers, including FREE HD and the NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion. Continuing the trends that we discussed on our last earnings call, the FREE HD offers seems to be particularly appealing to our target market, namely, higher income households that have high definition televisions. In the quarter, we reached yet another record, as over 75% of gross adds were activated with advanced services. However, our biggest jump came in customer signing up for both HD and DVR services, as that number grew to almost half of all new customers in the quarter compared to only 30% a year ago.
Now in addition to targeting and attaining higher quality new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job keeping our existing customers happy. We now approach churn management in a much more proactive and highly targeted manner. Our customer service agents have better information and tools to more effectively respond to our customers needs and desires. In addition, I believe that all parts of our operations under Mike Palkovic, from the initial installation to equipment reliability to our loyalty program and overall customer service, are all performing at improved levels, and are contributing to our lower churn rates.
More effective call center operations are also playing a key role in our ARPU growth, as our call agents are now much better equipped to upsell customers to higher packages or premium services. Now in addition to the strong HD and DVR trends I cited earlier, our ARPU was also boosted by the second consecutive quarter, in which we increased our overall buy rates for both premium and pay-per-view movies.
Also contributing to our strong ARPU growth was another quarter of excellent growth in advertising sales. In terms of our margins and the bottom line, Pat will go into much more detail, but overall, I was very pleased with our results. Our SAC continues to run at around that $800 level, but I'm confident at the vast majority of the increase, and we looked at this quite carefully, is related to investments in advanced equipment that drives either incremental revenue streams or an improved television experience, resulting in lower churn rates. But regardless has a substantially higher return on investment.  And our DIRECTV U.S. pre-SAC margin speaks for itself as it grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter, while reaching the highest level ever for the third quarter.
Let me turn briefly to DIRECTV Latin America. Clearly, the highlight there in the quarter was the continued subscriber momentum that we're seeing across the region. As I told you on our prior call, one concern we had was whether we could sustain the strong subscriber growth following the World Cup. I think our third quarter results answer that question loud and clear, as we saw an impressive 36% increase in gross additions over the prior year. Consistent with recent trends, the majority of our growth came from Brazil. In fact, Sky Brazil set yet another record by growing gross additions nearly 60% to 255,000, while topping the record they have just established in the prior quarter in the run-up to the World Cup.  But I also should point out, we saw a strong demand in several other countries as well, including Argentina, Ecuador, and even in Venezuela, where we've implemented what's essentially a virtually no growth strategy due to foreign exchange limitations.
In addition, our subscriber growth across the region continues to be diversified, with approximately 20% of new customer signing up for HD or DVR services, and about 20% choosing prepaid services. Now we also have some concern about churn potentially spiking after the World Cup. And as predicted, we did see and as planned, I might add, we did see an uptick in prepaid churn, but most importantly, postpaid churn in Latin America remained relatively flat from a year ago at 1.54%. Our ARPU was also solid in the quarter, particularly when you consider the 40% ARPU decline in Venezuela related to the devaluation of its currency earlier this year. Most importantly in local currency terms, our ARPU was up around 4% in the quarter, as we continue to benefit from price increases and strong demand for advanced services.
And even with the significant increase in gross additions, DIRECTV Latin America's operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded by seven percentage points to 34%, due mostly to lower cash repatriation cost in Venezuela, but also from improved programming margins and very solid cost management.
So in summary, I think it's clear from our results that both our U.S. and Latin American businesses have unique and sustainable competitive advantages that have positioned us well to continue increasing value for our shareholders by generating industry-leading topline and bottom-line growth. We are maintaining, in many cases, increasing both market share and margins, while using our under leveraged balance sheet and strong free cash flow to aggressively repurchase DIRECTV shares. Perhaps even more exciting are the many new growth opportunities that we see and hope to share with you at our December Investor Day. I speak for the entire executive management team when I tell you that we're very much looking forward to sharing with you our strategies for turning these growth opportunities into higher cash flow for all of our shareholders when we see you at our Investor Day on December 2.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill to talk a bit more about Latin America."
29614,115170721,85393,"DIRECTV, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mike. Again, as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter, particularly coming off a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year. The 525,000 gross additions are second on",880,"Great. Thanks, Mike. Again, as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter, particularly coming off a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year. The 525,000 gross additions are second only to the levels immediately preceding the World Cup earlier this year, and 36% higher than they were in Q3 of 2009. In fact, Sky Brazil reached record levels of gross additions, growing almost 60% versus the prior year, while PanAmericana grew about 20%, with Argentina and Ecuador delivering particularly strong year-over-year growth.
We're also seeing well balanced growth across each of the product market segments. In particular, about 20% of new customers signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter. In absolute terms, the number of gross additions taking advanced products was almost 45% higher than Q3 of 2009. With these results, about 25% of our 5.4 million subscribers have advanced products.
And we continued to be successful in offering innovative products targeted to the more middle market segments. In Brazil, our Sky Light package is very popular, and we have high expectations for our recently launched Sky Fit package as well. Both are affordably priced, entry-level postpaid products that allow the subscriber to add selected additional products and services on top. One year ago, our lowest priced postpaid package in Brazil was priced at 79.9 Reais versus the Sky Fit today which sells for 49.9 Reais or roughly 35% less. And yet, our programming margin on Sky Fit is consistent with our other packages, and I believe it is a testament to our ability to profitably serve the middle market segment. Prepaid gross additions represented 18% of our 525,000 gross adds in the quarter or 31% greater than last year. Cumulatively, prepaid subscribers makeup approximately 10% of our 5.4 million consolidated subscribers.
I was also pleased that our postpaid churn for the quarter of 1.54% met our expectations, while remaining relatively flat compared with the prior year. With regard to our prepaid services, as expected, we did see a decline in our recharge rates following the end of the World Cup. But as we have discussed before, we believe that giving this segment of consumers the option to sign up for pay-TV when they can afford it is still a good business for us, given the low net subscriber acquisition of costs associated with this group. We expect many of them will come back on in the months ahead, now that we have passed the natural lull of the post-World Cup periods.
We ended the quarter with 206,000 net adds. While this figure does not match the record we set last quarter in the run-up to the World Cup, it wasn't all that long ago that 206,000 net adds would have been a record. In fact, this is only the fourth time in our history that we have exceeded 200,000 net adds in a quarter, and it is still almost 30% better than we did last year.
We also had excellent financial results in the quarter, driven by a strong subscriber growth, revenues increased to 22%. ARPU was down modestly in dollars, due mostly to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU would have increased around 4%, driven by price increases and higher penetration of advanced products. OPBDA and cash flow before interest and taxes were even stronger as they grew 57% and 85%, respectively, over last year's results. The majority of this growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition cost associated with the increase in gross adds.
Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May, the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of a so-called parallel market for converting bolivars to U.S. dollars. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars, which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. As of September 30, we had approximately $120 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official 4.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar that is currently not available for repatriation. The currency control situation in Venezuela remains fluid and obviously, one we will continue to monitor closely. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can. Finally, I would like to make a few comments about the results of Sky Mexico, which are not consolidated in our results.
As some of you may already know, Sky Mexico continues to post extremely strong results, following the World Cup, adding more than 300,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 23,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 8.2 million subscribers. Financial results of Sky Mexico were equally strong, as revenue and OPBDA grew 20% and 34%, respectively.
So in summary, we had another very solid quarter, with continued strong subscriber growth across all three platforms, the diversified mix of product sales and strong financial results across the board. As a result, I remain confident that we are on track to meet the full year guidance we provided in our last earnings call. Pat?"

Much like Latin America, likely in the U.S. also had a very solid quarter and in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year, as our subscriber growth accelerated from the levels seen earlier in the year, while at the same time, we continued generating strong margins.
Starting first with subscribers. We reversed the five quarter trend of declining year-over-year net additions by growing 28% to 174,000 net new customers, as both our gross additions and churn rate were better than prior year. Gross additions of 1.14 million were particularly strong, and represented the best third quarter in six years. As Mike mentioned earlier, we attribute the strong demand to a combination of factors, including the introduction of new services such as the Whole-Home DVR, popular offers such as FREE HD, and more targeted incentives designed to exploit competitor weaknesses, while capitalizing on DIRECTV's strength. The strength of our direct sales and retail channels continue to more than offset the declining contribution from our telco partners. Even with the addition of CenturyLink, telco's contribution has gradually declined over the past year, and is currently only about 15% of total gross addition compared to a high of 25% in the first half of last year.
This decline is mostly related to the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse, as well as the reduced number of landline, which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at the telco call centers. We are also pleased with our average monthly churn rate of 1.7%, which for the first time in six quarters, was lower on a year-over-year basis. We saw favorable trends in both voluntary and involuntary churn. The main reason for the improvement is that we're managing churn in a more proactive, segmented and targeted fashion. We now have an improved customer relationship management system, where our agents have better tools and information to communicate more effectively with our customers. We also have more intelligence on the front end, including a sophisticated predictive model, which provides us with the ability to identify those customers who are most likely to churn, so that we can implement action plan to mitigate losses.  In addition, we're constantly looking for ways to further tighten our credit standards or introduce new tactics to reduce involuntary churn. For example, in order for our customers to receive the FREE HD offer, they have to sign up for Auto Bill Pay, which historically has been associated with lower churn rates.
Turning now to ARPU. The 4.3% growth was double last year's third quarter and consistent with our internal target. As predicted, the rate was modestly below our first-half growth, mostly due to all around tougher comparisons with the prior year, as well as a couple of one-time events including an extra NFL game and acceleration of our price increase by one month. Consistent with trends seen in recent quarters, premiums, pay-per-view movies and advertising sales remained strong in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, year-over-year buy rates increased for premium and pay-per-view movies for the second consecutive quarter.
Our subscriber VOD movies, movie revenues remained about half as much as cable, so I'm happy to see we're making progress in this area even before we ramp up marketing for our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service. Also contributing nicely to ARPU growth is the increase in demand from both new and existing customers for advanced services. You heard earlier that about 75% of new customers are activating with advanced services. Even though many of these customers are receiving HD for free, virtually all of them are signing up for DVR services for an extra $7 per month and many are taking our Whole-Home DVR service for an extra $3 per month. We're seeing many of these same trends with existing customer, which help explain the modest increase in our third quarter upgrade and retention cost.
Turning now to the bottom line. Pretax margin grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, but EBITDA margin declined by about a percentage point to 24% in the quarter, primarily due to higher growth additions and related increase in subscriber acquisition costs. As we've seen all year, our programming, subscriber services and broadcast operations costs were contained and well managed. I'll just explain the reason for our higher upgrade and retention cost, so I'd like to spend a minute discussing SAC. Of the $108 year-over-year increase in SAC, approximately 90% of that increase is related to the increased demand for advanced products. Included in this percentage are the higher relative cost of HD and DVR boxes, the additional equipment and installation cost related to the advanced dish, and also the extra commissions we pay dealers to acquire higher quality HD and DVR customers. There will likely be continued upward pressure on SAC related to our strategy to more aggressively connect customers, set-top boxes to the Internet beginning here in the fourth quarter.
It's important to point out that we make these investments only after completing a very rigorous analysis that concludes with a relatively high level of confidence that we will attain an attractive return on our investment. I believe those analytical process has a pretty good track record over the past few years of identifying areas where we can generate healthy financial returns by upgrading customers with advanced equipment. In fact, customers who have HD and DVR services continue to generate roughly twice the returns of basic customers due to the significantly better ARPU and churn.
More broadly, we believe that investing in advanced equipment or higher quality customers is the best use of our free cash flow to generate superior returns for our shareholders.  Looking quickly at DIRECTV U.S. cash flow in the quarter, the same things you heard earlier apply here, where the higher gross adds and demand for advanced equipment resulted in higher capital expenditures and lower cash flow.  
I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our fourth quarter outlook. You just heard Bruce reaffirm DIRECTV Latin America's full year outlook, so these comments apply to our U.S. business. In many ways, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're anticipating revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter, as gross and net additions are again expected to be better than prior year. Pre-SAC margin is expected to have its usual sequential decline from the third to the fourth quarter related to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET costs. In fact, it's expected to see continued upward pressure as  I discussed earlier.
In terms of DIRECTV's consolidated free cash flow, we expect to exceed our initial full year estimate of mid-single digit growth. We're estimating that we'll receive a benefit of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter related to the most recent economic stimulus program that extended the accelerated write-off of equipment for another year. Also, keep in mind that we are expecting to make a payment for the acquisition of an additional 19% ownership in Sky Brazil from Globo in the fourth quarter. This will be reported under investing activities and therefore, not included in our reported free cash flow metric.
Regarding our balance sheet and strategy for returning capital to shareholders, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of reaching 2.5x leverage target by the end of next year. With the $3 billion raise in the third quarter, our leverage ratio of total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPBDA now stands at about 2x. This ratio also reflects the $1.2 billion repayment of all of our remaining secured debt in the quarter. Finally, through yesterday, we have repurchased approximately $680 million out of our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization.  Year-to-date, we've repurchased about $4.2 billion, while reducing our shares outstanding by some 12%. Cumulatively, we've now reduced DIRECTV shares by about 40% since we began our buyback program in 2006.
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Jon, so he can begin our Q&A session."

But we're off to a good start for the fourth quarter, but I think it's hard to generalize on four weeks and, frankly, we had a good third quarter. So I mean, it's hard for me to kind of see some secular change going out there for the industry as a whole that I could comment on one way or the other.

They're investing with advanced products. They're investing with our MRV system, which we had almost 290,000 new customers taking MRV in the quarter. They are investing with HD DVR in a huge way, the almost 50% of our gross adds took HD DVR. That's way up from where it was a year ago, and they're also investing by buying pay-per-view movies. Our pay-per-view Movie business was up over 30%, as well as Premium business, which is up in the take rates, penetration rates on that are up as well. So I think we're certainly seeing a general interest in the overall quality entertainment experience that DIRECTV can provide our customers, and I think that's really been a key part of our success, I would say, coupled with our kind of NFL SUNDAY TICKET, and FREE HD promotion that we had in the quarter."

Are you going to settle with this at all, or do you sort of look at this and say, where we are in the cost curve, it still makes sense to sell these to whoever wants them, both in the installed base and in terms of gross adds. And so if the demand's there, we're going to move it or are you going to look to kind of moderate this and balance kind of near-term financial profits? I look to just understand how you're thinking about that. And then on the SUNDAY TICKET offer and just qualitatively, how did you guys do with the offer at the beginning of the season? The reason I asked is the NFL has done a pretty good job of making a lot of money everywhere they can in different windows. There's a lot of advertising with Verizon wireless and RED ZONE CHANNEL's available in a lot of places, the NFL Network is getting more distribution. Some people would argue that SUNDAY TICKET's being diluted by all these of other stuff, but I know you had a very good year last year and you've changed pricing around this year.

And it has a certain revenue stream that we can model for our customers and certain churn projections based on whether they're advance services and all kinds of things. They have sophisticated modeling approach to that. I can assure you, we look very carefully at our ROI on all of these advanced products and as Pat said in his remarks, the ROI is more than double what it is for a basic subscriber and I don't think, however, that means, therefore, SAC can go to infinity. We look very carefully at it. We're very disciplined in how we manage it. But again, we've got a product that consumers want right now, and it has a terrific ROI to it. Pat?"

I mean, we expected it to be an attractive product, but it really resonated with our customers. So on the new customer side, it's a pretty easy proposition, and I think with the incremental revenue we get there and the experience in churn, that's an easy one. We continue to monitor existing customers that want to upgrade to MRV because, again, depending on the technology in their home, that could be different proposition or it just doesn't make sense for some people to upgrade to MRV. But that one, I mean, we, again, we're very comfortable on gross add, very good return on that one because again, if you remember, that person's getting an HD DVR's probably got an HD box in the other room. And so he's paying us the $7, maybe the $10 for HD and the $3 for MRV. So the returns are very good there. Going in to like the fourth quarter where we're stressing broadband connectivity, I mean, I think as a team here, we're very bullish on the advantages of connecting boxes to the Internet. Again, we're offering it free for our very best customers. We're starting out in that way. we'll certainly monitor it, check our kind of financial projections on what we think that's going to drive as far as incremental revenue and a stickier customer.

And the branding of NFL SUNDAY TICKET and its role in our DIRECTV services, it plays a very important role from an overarching branding standpoint. Having said that, I would say that our NFL SUNDAY TICKET results were acceptable in the quarter. They weren't outstanding, by any stretch of the imagination. I would say we saw some modest falloff in renewals, but we have strong gross adds in the quarter, and about 25% of our gross adds took the ticket.

I mean, in every market, we compete against generally one large cable company that, in some cases, is owned by a company for example like Telmex or Telefónica . In other cases, it's an independent cable company. So it's not as if the competition isn't already there. And in fact, in the case of Brazil, for example, several of the telcos have launched a fairly modest DTH platforms. So I'm aware of the competition. I think we continue to compete very well, and I think it goes back to a point that I've made probably over and over again on some of these calls that some of you may be tired of hearing me it which is, the key advantage we have is our product is just better. We have the advantage of taking all of the products in the R&D that is developed for the benefit of DIRECTV in the U.S, which is the world's most competitive pay-TV market, and we're able to bring it to Latin America sooner, better and cheaper than everybody else. So I'm very confident that from a competitive point of view, we will continue to do more than hold our own. On the second point about market growth, I think that you have to keep in mind a couple of things. One, you're correct about our ability to get into new segments and then particularly, more middle market segments, which I talked about. I think the other thing you have to remember is, in many markets, particularly Brazil, for example, there is a sort of a macroeconomics phenomenon going on, where a lot of people are rising from more lower or mass-market segments into middle market segments. So people moving from D&E [developing & emerging] class holds into C&D [construction and development]. And so the actual pie that all of us in this business are going after is increasing, so it is not like the United States, where you have very high penetration, and you're really fighting for share. I mean, the pay TV penetration is up in Latin America, but it's still in the mid -- the high 20s percentage points. It's not anything close to the saturation point. So assuming continued relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions, I think there's still a lot of running room to grow."

And those that have less than a college degree, where unemployment is over 20% and consumers are hurting. So I think, certainly, our strong belief is that we need greater package flexibility for price sensitive customers in our industry. We continue to have those discussions with our programming partners, and we continue to look for ways to do that just as we're doing in Latin America. Frankly, I think we're probably learning as much in this case from Latin America for our U.S. business as Bruce gets advantage from the U.S. business on other things. But certainly, the idea of more segmentation and more package flexibility, I believe, certainly, is important for us for the entire ecosystem to be able to service the -- shall we say, the bottom of the pyramid in the United States."

And do you feel that you can grow as fast as the overall pay-TV market, given your premium end concentration or if you go in sort of the bottom end of the pyramid, could you grow even faster? And then secondly, one of your real beautiful points is just to get for marketing in the commercial both in the U.S. whether you're marketing Russians or Texans. When we look of the DTV Cinema, it looks like, you're very well positioned to take on Netflix, I mean, you can't do the all you can eat proposition, do you feel like you're getting pretty good sheet of scores on the incremental marketing campaign? And I'm sure you'll be talking a lot about the new user interface at your Investor Conference and all that."

I’d like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter and then, I’ll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce as is customary for more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses.
Overall though, I thought our third quarter results were certainly the best for the year, as we gained market share in both regions, North America and South America, while also maintaining very strong margins.
My main takeaways from the quarter are, first, DIRECTV and Sky Latin America’s strong brands and differentiated content continue to drive greater consumer demand for our services, both in the United States and across Latin America. In addition, to gaining share our customers also are purchasing more HD, DVR and premium services, which contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our company.
Second, we’re continuing to manage our costs effectively, capturing efficiencies and productivity improvements. Despite a 13% increase in consolidated gross additions and related increase in acquisition costs, we still achieved double-digit OPBDA growth and grew our earnings per share by 49% in the quarter.
Third, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet and returning the capital to shareholders by issuing $3 billion in debt and repurchasing $1.37 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date buybacks to $3.6 billion.
Let’s first look at the DIRECTV U.S. business. I’m particularly pleased to see that as our year progressed, our subscriber momentum continues to build. In fact our third quarter was the first time in six quarters where both our gross adds and our churn, were better than prior year’s period, resulting in a 28% increase in net additions to $174,000.
Consumer demand for DIRECTV services remains extremely strong for a couple reasons. It’s clear that some of our new products are resonating well with our customers.
For instance, I mentioned at an investor conference a few weeks ago that our take rate for whole-home DVR services was running around 25% of gross adds, and recently we’ve seen that number reach as high as 40% of new subscribers.
We intend to keep that momentum going in the fourth quarter with continued focus on our multi-room viewing product as well as re-launching our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service and more aggressively connecting our most valuable subscribers’ receivers to the Internet.
We continue to believe that a set-top box connected to the Internet provides our customers with significantly more features and services, which in turn will drive greater ARPU and lower churn.
Another reason behind the strong demand we saw in the quarter is the popularity of our offers, including free HD in the NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion. Continuing the trends that we discussed in our last earnings call, the free HD offer seems to be particularly appealing to our target market, namely higher income households that have high-definition televisions.
In the quarter, we reached yet another record as over 75% of gross adds were activated with advanced services. However, our biggest jump came in customers signing up for both HD and DVR services, as that number grew to almost half of all new customers in the quarter compared to only 30% a year ago.
Now in addition to targeting and attaining higher quality new subscribers, I think we’re also doing a better job keeping our existing customers happy. We now approach churn management in a much more proactive and highly targeted manner. Our customer service agents have better information tools to more effectively respond to our customers’ needs and desires.
In addition, I believe that all parts of our operations under Mike Palkovic from the initial installation to equipment reliability to our loyalty program and overall customer service are all performing at improved levels and are contributing to our lower churn rates.
More effective call center operations are also playing a key role in our ARPU growth as our call agents are now much better equipped to upsell customers to higher packages or premium services.
Now in addition to the strong HD and DVR trends I cited earlier, our ARPU was also boosted by the second consecutive quarter in which we increased our overall buy rates for both premium and pay-per-view movies. Also contributing to our strong ARPU growth was another quarter of excellent growth in advertising sales.
In terms of our margins in the bottom-line, Pat will go into much more detail, but overall I was very pleased with our results. Our SAC continues to run it around that $800 level, but I’m confident that the vast majority of the increase, and we’ve looked at this quite carefully, is related to investments in advanced equipment that drives either incremental revenue streams or an improved television experience, resulting in lower churn rates, but regardless has a substantially higher return on investment.
Our DIRECTV U.S. pre-SAC margin speaks for itself, as it grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter, while reaching the highest level ever for third quarter.
Let me turn briefly to DIRECTV Latin America. Clearly the highlight there in the quarter was the continued subscriber momentum that we’re seeing across the region.
As I told on our prior call, one concern we had was whether we could sustain the strong subscriber growth following the World Cup. I think our third quarter results answered that question loud and clear as we saw an impressive 36% increase in gross additions over prior year.
Consistent with recent trends, the majority of our growth came from Brazil. In fact, Sky Brazil set yet another record by growing gross additions nearly 60% to 255,000 while topping the record they had just established in the prior quarter in the run up to the World Cup.
But I also should point out, we saw a strong demand in several other countries as well, including Argentina, Ecuador and even in Venezuela where we have implemented what’s essentially a virtually no-growth strategy due to foreign exchange limitations.
In addition, our subscriber growth across the region continues to be diversified with approximately 20% of new customers, signing up for HD or DVR services and about 20% choosing prepaid services.
Now, we also have some concern about churn potentially spiking after the World Cup. As predicted, and as planned, I might add, we did see an uptick in prepaid churn, but most importantly, postpaid churn in Latin America remained relatively flat from a year ago at 1.54%.
Our ARPU was also solid in the quarter particularly when you consider the 40% ARPU decline in Venezuela related to the devaluation of its currency earlier this year. Most importantly, in local currency terms, our ARPU was up around 4% in the quarter as we continue to benefit from price increases and strong demand for advanced services.
Even with the significant increase in gross additions, DIRECTV Latin America’s operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded by seven percentage points to 34% due mostly to lower cash repatriation costs in Venezuela, but also from improved programming margins and very solid costs management.
So, in summary, I think it’s clear from our results that both our U.S. and Latin American businesses have unique and sustainable competitive advantages that have positioned us well to continue increasing value for our shareholders, by generating industry leading top line and bottom-line growth.
We are maintaining, in many cases increasing, both market share and margins, while using our underleveraged balance sheet and strong free cash flow to aggressively repurchase DIRECTV shares.
Perhaps even more exciting are the many new growth opportunities that we see and hope to share with you at our December Investor Day. I speak for the entire executive management team when I tell you that we’re very much looking forward to sharing with you our strategies for turning these growth opportunities into higher cash flow for all of our shareholders when we see you at our Investor Day on December 2nd.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill to talk a bit more about Latin America.
"
29614,115170721,85467,"DIRECTV, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Great, thanks Mike. Again as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter particularly coming of a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year.

Again as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter particularly coming of a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year. The 525,000 gross additions are second only to the levels immediately preceding the World Cup earlier this year and 36% higher than they were in Q3 of 2009.
In fact, Sky Brazil reached record levels of gross additions, growing almost 60% versus the prior year, while PanAmericana grew about 20% with Argentina and Ecuador delivering particularly strong year-over-year growth.
We’re also seeing well-balanced growth across each of the product market segment. In particular, about 20% of new customers signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter. In absolute terms, the number of gross additions taking advanced products was almost 45% higher than Q3 of 2009. With these results, about 25% of our 5.4 million subscribers have advanced products.
We continue to be successful in offering innovative products targeted to the more middle market segment. In Brazil, our Sky Light package is very popular and we have high expectations for our recently launched Sky Fit package as well. Both are affordably priced entry level postpaid products that allow the subscriber to add selected additional products and services on top.
One year ago, our lowest priced postpaid package in Brazil was priced at 79.9 reais versus the Sky Fit today which sells for 49.9 reais, or 35% less. Yet our programming margin on Sky Fit is consistent with our other packages, and I believe it is a testament to our ability to profitably serve the middle market segment.
Prepaid gross additions represented 18% of our 525,000 gross adds in the quarter were 31% greater than last year. Cumulatively prepaid subscribers make up approximately 10% of our $5.4 million consolidated subscriber. I was also pleased that our postpaid churns for the quarter of 1.54% met our expectations, while remaining relatively flat compared with the prior year.
With regard to our prepaid services as expected, we did see a decline in our recharge rates following the end of the World Cup. But as we have discussed before, we believe that giving this segment of consumers the option to sign up for pay TV when they can afford it, is still a good business for us, given the low net subscriber acquisition of cost associated with this group. We expect many of them will come back on in the months ahead now that we’re passed the natural low of the post World Cup periods.
We ended the quarter with 206,000 net adds. While this figures does not match the record we set last quarter in the run up to the World Cup, it wasn’t all that long ago that 206,000 net adds would have been a record. In fact, this is only the fourth time in our history that we have exceeded 200,000 net adds in a quarter and it is still almost 30% better than we did last year.
We also had excellent financial results in the quarter. Driven by strong subscriber growth, revenues increased 22%. ARPU was down modestly in dollars due mostly to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange ARPU would have increased around 4%, driven by price increases and higher penetration of advanced products.
OPBDA and cash flow before interest and taxes were even stronger as they grew 57% and 85% respectively over the last year’s results. Majority of this growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross adds.
Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of the so-called parallel market for converting bolivars to U.S. dollars. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars, which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last.
As of September 30th, we had approximately $120 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official 4.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar that is currently not available for repatriation. The currency control situation at Venezuela remains fluid and obviously, one we will continue to monitor closely. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about the results of Sky Mexico which are not consolidated in our results. As some of you may already know, Sky Mexico continues to post extremely strong results following the World Cup adding more than 300,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 23,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 8.2 million subscribers. Financial results of Sky Mexico were equally strong as revenue in OPBDA grew 20% and 34%, respectively.
So, in summary, we had another very solid quarter, with continued strong subscriber growth across all three platforms, a diversified mix of product sales and strong financial results across the board. As a result, I remain confident that we’re on track to meet the full year guidance we provided in our last earnings call. Pat?

Much like Latin America, DIRECTV U.S. also had a very solid quarter and in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year, as our subscriber growth accelerated from the levels seen earlier in the year, while at the",1333,"Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, DIRECTV U.S. also had a very solid quarter and in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year, as our subscriber growth accelerated from the levels seen earlier in the year, while at the same time we continued generating strong margins.
Starting first with subscribers, we reversed a five quarter trend of declining year-over-year net additions by growing 28% to 174,000 net new customers, as both our gross additions and churn rate were better than prior year. Gross additions of 1.14 million were particularly strong and represented the best third quarter in six years.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we attribute the strong demand to a combination of factors, including the introduction of new services, such as the Whole-Home DVR, popular offer such as Free HD, and more targeted incentives designed to exploit competitor weaknesses, while capitalizing on DIRECTV strength. The strength of our direct sales and retail channels continue to more than offset the declining contribution from our Telco partners.
Even with the addition of CenturyLink, Telco’s contribution has gradually declined over the past year and is currently only about 15% of total gross additions compared to a high of 25% in the first half of last year. This decline is mostly related to the continued rollout of FiOS and U-Verse, as well as the reduced number of landlines which resulted in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at the Telco call centers.
We’re also pleased with our average monthly churn rate of 1.7%, which for the first time in six quarters was lower on a year-over-year basis. We saw favorable trends in both voluntary and involuntary churn. The main reason for the improvement is that we’re managing churn in a more proactive, segmented, and targeted fashion.
We now have an improved customer relationship management system, where agents have better tools and information to communicate more effectively with our customers. We also have more intelligence on the front end, including a sophisticated predicted model, which provides us with the ability to identify those customers who are more likely to churn, so that we can implement action plans to mitigate losses.
In addition, we are constantly looking for ways to further tighten our credit standards or introduce new tactics to reduce involuntary churn. For example, in order for our customers to receive the free HD offer, they have to sign up for Auto Bill Pay, which historically has been associated with lower churn rate.
Turning now to ARPU, the 4.3% growth was double last year’s third quarter and consistent with our internal target. As predicted, the rate was modestly below our first half growth, mostly due to all around tougher comparisons with the prior year, as well as the couple of one-time events including an extra NFL game and acceleration of our price increase by one month.
Consistent with trends seen in recent quarters, premiums, pay-per-view movies, and advertising sales remained strong in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, year-over-year buy rates increased our premium and pay-per-view movies for the second consecutive quarter.
Our subscriber VOD movie revenues remained about half as much as cable, so I am happy to see we’re making progress in this area even before we ramp up marketing for our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service. Also contributing nicely to ARPU growth is the increase in demand from both new and existing customers for advanced services. You heard earlier that about 75% of new customers are activating with advanced services.
Even though many of these customers are receiving HD for free, virtually all of them are signing up for DVR services for an extra $7 per month and many are taking our whole home DVR service for an extra $3 per month. We’re seeing many of these same trends with existing customer, which help explain the modest increase in our third quarter upgrade and retention costs.
Turning now to the bottom line, pre-tax margin grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, but EBITDA margin declined about a percentage point to 24% in the quarter, primarily due to higher growth additions and related increase in subscriber acquisition costs.
As we’ve seen all year, our programming, subscriber services, and broadcast operations costs were contained and well managed. I just explained the reason for our higher upgrade and retention costs. So, I’d like to spend a minute discussing SAC.
Of the $108 year-over-year increase in SAC, approximately 90% of that increase is related to the increased demand for advanced products. Included on this percentage are the higher relative costs of HD and DVR boxes, the additional equipment and installation costs related to the advanced Dish and also the extra commissions we pay dealers to acquire higher quality HD and DVR customers.
There will likely be continued upward pressure on SAC related to our strategy to more aggressively connect customers’ set-top boxes to the Internet beginning here in the fourth quarter.
It’s important to point out that we make these investments only after completing a very rigorous analysis that concludes with a relatively high level of confidence that we will obtain an attractive return on our investment.
I believe those analytical process has a pretty good track record over the past few years of identifying areas where we can generate healthy financial returns by upgrading customers with advanced equipments. In fact, customers with HD and DVR services continue to generate roughly twice the returns of basic customers due to the significantly better ARPU and churn.
More broadly, we believe that investing in advanced equipment for higher quality customers is the best use of our free cash flow to generate superior returns for our shareholders.
Looking quickly at DIRECTV U.S. cash flow in the quarter, the same things you heard earlier apply here where the higher gross adds and demand for advanced equipment resulted in higher capital expenditures and lower cash flow.
I’d like to wrap up with a few comments about our fourth quarter outlook. You just heard Bruce reaffirm DIRECTV Latin America’s full year outlook. So, these comments apply to our U.S. business.
In many ways, we’re expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We’re anticipating revenue growth would be similar to the third quarter as gross and net additions are again expected to be better than prior year.
Pre-SAC margin is expected to have its usual sequential decline from the third to the fourth quarter, related to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET cost and SAC, as expected, to see continued upward pressure, as I discussed earlier.
In terms of DIRECTV’s consolidated free cash flow, we expect to exceed our initial full year estimate of mid single-digit growth. We’re estimating that we’ll receive a benefit of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter related to the most recent economic stimulus program that extended the accelerated write-off of equipment for another year.
Also, keep in mind that we are expecting to make a payment for the acquisition of an additional 19% ownership in Sky Brazil from Globo in the fourth quarter. This will be reported under investing activities and therefore, not included in our reported free cash flow metrics.
Regarding our balance sheet and strategy for returning capital to shareholders, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of reaching 2.5 times leveraged target by the end of next year. With the $3 billion raise in the third quarter, our leverage ratio of total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPBDA now stands at about 2 times. This ratio also reflects the $1.2 billion repayment of all our remaining secured debt in the quarter.
Finally, through yesterday, we had repurchased approximately $680 million out of our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we’ve repurchased about $4.2 billion, while reducing our shares outstanding by some 12%. Cumulatively we’ve now reduced DIRECTV shares by about 40% since we began our buyback program in 2006.
So with that, I’ll turn the call back to John, so that he can begin our Q&A session.

Thanks for taking the question. If you could talk regarding the U.S. I mean, both (inaudible) Comcast have mentioned, they have seen subscriber trends improving thus far in the quarter and certainly indicates that you guys are going to be up year-on-year. But are you seeing similar trends, should we look at this as a market-wide thing or is there something share driven going on there?
Secondly regarding, both Latin America and the U.S. and I do understand you have been kicking the tires in some mobile data options in Latin America. If you could talk a little bit about that and to what degree you see the need to have some sort of either operational or ownership participation in mobile networks in Latin America and the U.S. as part of the overall mobile video strategy versus just having an app?

I think you have a lot of things going on in October that I wouldn’t generalize for the full quarter, but as Pat said our expectation is to see continued trends on pretty much all fronts, both growth in net subscribers churn improvements and financial management, probably directionally consistent with Q3 and Q4. But, we’re off to a good start for the fourth quarter, but I think it’s hard to generalize on four weeks and frankly, we had a good third quarter.
So it’s hard for me see some secular change going out there for the industry as a whole that I could comment on one way or the other. Like I can only say, look our trends continue to be good. On the question on mobile networks, Bruce you want to comment on that Latin American, our thinking there?

There are many more mobile telephones than there are fixed line telephones. So therefore, given that its earlier days there might be an opportunity for us to participate in some way in that arena, since it seems to be a somewhat logical adjacent product for us.
Having said that I think in all likelihood it’s something we would do with partners, we would not do alone and it’s not an area of expertise for us and there’s a lot of different ways that partnerships could be constructed. So it’s something where we’re looking at just because of where we are in that development cycle. At the same time to your question if it is something I need, I certainly do not need it today. I don’t think we’re in the world where having mobile video delivered over mobile devices is a big market. So, it’s not something I’m missing.

So I think we’re seeing it come pretty broad based across our footprint. I would certainly tell you and I think I commented on this on the call.
I think the big news is in my mind there is a segment of consumers out there, In our case, it is the ones that are targeted the upper income pay for the premium service that are investing in their home entertainment system, if you will. They are investing with advanced products. They are investing with our MRV system, which we had almost 290,000 new customers taking MRV in the quarter. They are investing with HD DVR in a huge way, almost 50% of our gross adds took HD DVR. That’s way up from where it was a year ago and they are also investing by buying pay-per-view movies. Our pay-per-view movie business was up over 30% as well as premium business, which is up, and the take rates, penetration rates on that are up as well.
So, I think we’re certainly seeing a general interest in the overall quality entertainment experience that DIRECTV can provide for customers. I think that’s really been a key part of our success. I would say, coupled with our NFL SUNDAY TICKET and free HD promotion that we had in the quarter.

Mike or Pat or both of you, I was wondering if you could talk about how you’re balancing investment in these new products relative to the demand you are seeing. Clearly, the MRV successes there, you have a couple of other products coming out and obviously connected set-tops include a lot of investment in the home around installation work. Are you going to throttle this at all or do you sort of look at this and say where we are in the cost curve? It still make sense to sell these to whoever wants them both in the installed base and in terms of gross adds, and so if the demand is there we’re going to move it or you’re going to look to kind of moderate this and balance near-term financial profits, just understand how you’re thinking about that.
And then on the SUNDAY TICKET offer, just qualitatively how do you guys do with the offer at the beginning of the season? The reason I ask is the NFL has done a pretty good job of making a lot of money everywhere they can in different windows. There is a lot of advertising with Verizon Wireless and RedZone channel is available at a lot of places. The NFL Network is getting more distribution. Some people would argue that SUNDAY TICKET is being diluted by all other stuff, but I know you had a very good year last year and you’ve changed pricing around this year. So, just curious how SUNDAY TICKET is going?

I think on the first question look, we looked very carefully. The nature of our business model as you know, Ben, we almost look at our investment in SAC like as a CapEx, like as a capital expenditure, because it is, and it has a certain revenue stream that we can model for our customers and with certain churn projections based on whether their advanced services and all kinds of things. We’ve very sophisticated modeling approach to that. I can assure you we look very carefully at our ROI on all of these advanced products.
As Pat said in his remarks, the ROI is more than double what it is for a basic subscriber. I don’t think, however, that means therefore, SAC can go to infinity. We looked very carefully at it. We’re very disciplined in how we mange it, but again we’ve got a product that consumers want right now and it has a terrific ROI to it?

We expected it to be an attractive product, but it really resonated with our customers.
On the new customer side, it’s a pretty easy proposition, and I think the incremental revenue we get there and the experience and churn, that’s an easy one. We continue to monitor existing customers. They want to upgrade to MRV, because again depending on the technology in their home that could be a different proposition where it just doesn’t make sense for some people to upgrade to MRV.
Again, we are very comfortable on gross add, very good return on that one because again you remember that person is getting an HD DVR, probably got an HD box in the other room, and so he is paying us the $7, maybe the $10 for HD and the $3 for MRV. So the returns are very good there.
Going into the fourth quarter where we’re stressing broadband connectively, I think as a team here, we’re very bullish on the advantages of connecting boxes to the Internet. Again, we’re offering it free for our very best customers. We’re starting out in that way, we’ll certainly monitor it, check our financial projections on what we think that’s going to drive as far as incremental revenue and a sticker customer.
But I think again, we feel like this is kind of a must that it’s important for our customers to have that total experience of being hooked up to broadband, but right now we’re very comfortable on these investments and kind of returns they’re going to generate for us.

Our VOD on-demand revenue per sub are less than half of what an average cable company gets. We think that’s a big opportunity, a big incremental revenue opportunity in profit opportunity for us in the years ahead as we pursue that strategy.
On the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, look let’s keep in mind first of all, it’s a very important partnership that we’ve had with the NFL for many, many years. We value that partnership and the branding of NFL SUNDAY TICKET and its role in our DIRECTV services it plays a very important role from an overarching branding standpoint.
Having said that I would say that our NFL SUNDAY TICKET results were acceptable in the quarter. They weren’t outstanding by any stretch of the imagination. I would say we saw some modest fall off loss in renewals, but we had strong gross adds in the quarter and about 25% of our gross adds took the ticket. We had a good experience I think with our NFL Mobile offering, where we had almost 350,000 customers in the quarter and I think we’re getting a lot of learning about that as we look in the years ahead. But I would say we’re satisfied with the performance in the quarter of where we ended up.

And then Bruce, the growth of Latin America continues to obviously be pretty excellent. So, two things happen when you grow this fast to strong. First, we all start getting concerned that the strong growth will suggest the competitors that this is a bigger market than they thought and they start to ramp efforts to get into the market.
Second, you start to segment the customer base to continue to improve penetrations which you’ve obviously done quite well. So, that starts to suggest that maybe you flushed out a lot of the growth and growth will start to slow. So, the question is, are competitors ramping efforts in video in Latin America and can you sustain this level of growth and if so, how do you do that?

In every market, we compete against generally on large cable company that in some cases is owned by a company for example like Telmex or Telefonica, in other case it’s an independent cable company. So it’s not as if the competition isn’t already there and in fact, in the case of Brazil for example several of the Telco’s have launched fairly modest DTH platform.
So, I’m aware of the competition. I think we continue to compete very well and I think it goes back to a point that I’ve made probably over and over again on some of these call and some of you may be tired of hearing me say it, which is key advantage we have is our product is just better.
We have the advantage of taking all the products in the R&D that is developed for the benefit of DIRECTV in the U.S. which is the world’s most competitive Pay-TV market and we’re able to bring it to Latin America sooner, better and cheaper than everybody else. So I’m very confident that from a competitive point of view we will continue to do more than hold our own.
On the second point about market growth I think that you have to keep in mind a couple of things. One, you’re correct about our ability to get into new segments and in particularly more middle markets segments which I talked about. I think the other thing you have to remember is in many market particular Brazil, for example, there is a sort of macro economics that I’m not going on where a lot of people are rising from more lower or mass market segments into middle market segment. So, people moving from D&E class holds into C&D. So, the actual pie that all of us in this business are going after is increasing.
So it is not like the United States where you have very high penetration and you’re really fighting for share. I mean the Pay-TV penetration is up in Latin America, but it’s still in the high-20 percentage points. It’s not anything close to the saturation point. So, assuming continued relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions, I think there is still a lot of running room to grow.

We continue to have those discussions with our programming partners, and we continue to look for ways to do that just as we’re doing in Latin America.

We’ve made a decision to be right down the middle on the fairway on dealing with that. So I think the authorization that we’ve got in August for share repurchases is kind of our intent to use that to get us through kind of the end of the year and maybe a little bit into January before we do something more with share repurchase. So, kind of, yes and no. There’s nothing kind of black and white, but we’ve taken a fairly conservative view and that’s how we’re approaching our share repurchase right now.
On the accounting, you’re right. I mean we’re finishing up one of the contracts with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET this season. As it turned out at the end of that contract, we ended up reporting a modest margin on the program as a whole. Next year, we won’t have that margin to report in addition to a year-over-year increase in the cost of the NFL SUNDAY TICKET. So we’re looking at next year as probably something around 200 point increase from 2010 and 2011 as we look at NFL SUNDAY TICKET costs.

In other words to get well above that 25% number that I quoted earlier, we are going to have to penetrate some of those a good part of that market and as I think I mentioned in my comments we now have a package at 49.90 reais in Brazil which is roughly $28 or so. That’s not to say that people just get that because they can also buy some other services on top of that, but that’s obviously lower than where we are today.

The cash, I mentioned earlier about the $120 million of cash at the official rate in Venezuela. We obviously, wouldn’t repatriate all of that. We do have ongoing liabilities in Venezuela, cost associated, we pay programming in local currency. We have obviously employees there et cetera. So, it’s hard for me to estimate what the impact would have been, because it’s also hard to estimate what the parallel rate would be.

I think programming cost is a significant challenge for the entire industry and it’s clear that the new dual revenue model for the broadcast business is here to stay and that is going to drive up the cost of everyone’s programming, as well as I think driving up the consumer’s Pay-TV bill each month.

But it’s not like we’re starting from zero which some of our cable competitors are.
But I think this whole arena is why really you’re going to see several things. All of us are having to take very, very tough measures on channels that we deemed to either be less popular or new channels for that matter that not everybody can go up and price and value for money is going to be critical. We’re going to be pushing hard for greater package flexibility and I think you’re going to see much greater scrutiny over MSN provisions, on both packaging as well as price.
Lastly, I think we’re distributor or a retailer if you will, if our suppliers raise their cost of programming to us we need to pass it on to our consumers and we’re going to have to work hard to communicate that clearly to our consumers as those costs increases comes through our P&L in the years ahead.

So I am very bullish about what we will be able to do with the consumer, and we recognize in our space we have to look very broadly at competitors, and we have a lot of respect for what Netflix has done, but we intent to compete and to compete aggressively in that space, and I think you’ll see a lot of that as we rollout our new DIRECTV Cinema service in December of this year. I think that will give you a bit of a taste of where we’re going, and I think the bigger metric to keep in mind is, as I said, our VOD per subscriber is less than half of what cable guys are today, much less where Netflix is. So we think it’s a big revenue growth opportunity for our company.

I'd like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce as is customary for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American bus",1354,"Thanks, John, thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce as is customary for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses. Overall though, I thought our third quarter results were certainly the best of the year, as we gain market share in both regions, North America and South America, while also maintaining very strong margins. My main takeaways from the quarter are: first, DIRECTV and Sky Light America's strong brands and differentiated content continued to drive greater consumer demand for our services, both in the United States and across Latin America. In addition to gaining share, our customers also are purchasing more HD, DVR and premium services, which contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our company.
Second, we're continuing to manage our cost effectively, capturing efficiencies and productivity improvements. Despite a 13% increase in consolidated gross additions, and related increase in acquisition cost, we still achieved double-digit OPBDA growth, and grew our earnings per share by 49% in the quarter.  And third, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet and returning the capital to shareholders by issuing $3 billion in debt and repurchasing $1.37 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date buybacks to $3.6 billion.
Let's first look at the DIRECTV U.S. business. I'm particularly pleased to see that as our year progressed, our subscriber momentum continues to build. In fact, our third quarter was the first time in six quarters where both our gross adds and our churn were better than prior year's period, resulting in a 28% increase in net additions to 174,000. Consumer demand for DIRECTV's services remains extremely strong for a couple of reasons. It's clear that some of our new products are resonating well with our customers. For instance, I mentioned at an investor conference a few weeks ago that our take rates for Whole-Home DVR services was running around 25% of gross adds. And recently, we've seen that number reach as high as 40% of new subscribers. We intend to keep that momentum going in the fourth quarter, with continued focus on our Multi-Room Viewing product, as well as relaunching our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service, and more aggressively connecting our most valuable subscriber’s receivers to the Internet.
We continue to believe that a set-top box connected to the Internet provides our customers with significantly more features and services, which in turn, will drive greater ARPU and lower churn. Another reason behind the strong demand we saw in the quarter is the popularity of our offers, including FREE HD and the NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion. Continuing the trends that we discussed on our last earnings call, the FREE HD offers seems to be particularly appealing to our target market, namely, higher income households that have high definition televisions. In the quarter, we reached yet another record, as over 75% of gross adds were activated with advanced services. However, our biggest jump came in customer signing up for both HD and DVR services, as that number grew to almost half of all new customers in the quarter compared to only 30% a year ago.
Now in addition to targeting and attaining higher quality new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job keeping our existing customers happy. We now approach churn management in a much more proactive and highly targeted manner. Our customer service agents have better information and tools to more effectively respond to our customer’s needs and desires. In addition, I believe that all parts of our operations under Mike Palkovic, from the initial installation to equipment reliability to our loyalty program and overall customer service, are all performing at improved levels, and are contributing to our lower churn rates.
More effective call center operations are also playing a key role in our ARPU growth, as our call agents are now much better equipped to upsell customers to higher packages or premium services. Now in addition to the strong HD and DVR trends I cited earlier, our ARPU was also boosted by the second consecutive quarter, in which we increased our overall buy rates for both premium and pay-per-view movies.
Also contributing to our strong ARPU growth was another quarter of excellent growth in advertising sales. In terms of our margins and the bottom line, Pat will go into much more detail, but overall, I was very pleased with our results. Our SAC continues to run at around that $800 level, but I'm confident at the vast majority of the increase, and we looked at this quite carefully, is related to investments in advanced equipment that drives either incremental revenue streams or an improved television experience, resulting in lower churn rates. But regardless has a substantially higher return on investment.  And our DIRECTV U.S. pre-SAC margin speaks for itself as it grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter, while reaching the highest level ever for the third quarter.
Let me turn briefly to DIRECTV Latin America. Clearly, the highlight there in the quarter was the continued subscriber momentum that we're seeing across the region. As I told you on our prior call, one concern we had was whether we could sustain the strong subscriber growth following the World Cup. I think our third quarter results answer that question loud and clear, as we saw an impressive 36% increase in gross additions over the prior year. Consistent with recent trends, the majority of our growth came from Brazil. In fact, Sky Brazil set yet another record by growing gross additions nearly 60% to 255,000, while topping the record they have just established in the prior quarter in the run-up to the World Cup.  But I also should point out, we saw a strong demand in several other countries as well, including Argentina, Ecuador, and even in Venezuela, where we've implemented what's essentially a virtually no growth strategy due to foreign exchange limitations.
In addition, our subscriber growth across the region continues to be diversified, with approximately 20% of new customer signing up for HD or DVR services, and about 20% choosing prepaid services. Now we also have some concern about churn potentially spiking after the World Cup. And as predicted, we did see and as planned, I might add, we did see an uptick in prepaid churn, but most importantly, postpaid churn in Latin America remained relatively flat from a year ago at 1.54%. Our ARPU was also solid in the quarter, particularly when you consider the 40% ARPU decline in Venezuela related to the devaluation of its currency earlier this year. Most importantly in local currency terms, our ARPU was up around 4% in the quarter, as we continue to benefit from price increases and strong demand for advanced services.
And even with the significant increase in gross additions, DIRECTV Latin America's operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded by seven percentage points to 34%, due mostly to lower cash repatriation cost in Venezuela, but also from improved programming margins and very solid cost management.
So in summary, I think it's clear from our results that both our U.S. and Latin American businesses have unique and sustainable competitive advantages that have positioned us well to continue increasing value for our shareholders by generating industry-leading topline and bottom-line growth. We are maintaining, in many cases, increasing both market share and margins, while using our under leveraged balance sheet and strong free cash flow to aggressively repurchase DIRECTV shares. Perhaps even more exciting are the many new growth opportunities that we see and hope to share with you at our December Investor Day. I speak for the entire executive management team when I tell you that we're very much looking forward to sharing with you our strategies for turning these growth opportunities into higher cash flow for all of our shareholders when we see you at our Investor Day on December 2.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill to talk a bit more about Latin America."
29614,115170721,85559,"DIRECTV, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DirecTV, LLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mike. Again, as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter, particularly coming off a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year. The 525,000 gross additions are second on",880,"Great. Thanks, Mike. Again, as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter, particularly coming off a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year. The 525,000 gross additions are second only to the levels immediately preceding the World Cup earlier this year, and 36% higher than they were in Q3 of 2009. In fact, Sky Brazil reached record levels of gross additions, growing almost 60% versus the prior year, while PanAmericana grew about 20%, with Argentina and Ecuador delivering particularly strong year-over-year growth.
We're also seeing well balanced growth across each of the product market segments. In particular, about 20% of new customers signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter. In absolute terms, the number of gross additions taking advanced products was almost 45% higher than Q3 of 2009. With these results, about 25% of our 5.4 million subscribers have advanced products.
And we continued to be successful in offering innovative products targeted to the more middle market segments. In Brazil, our Sky Light package is very popular, and we have high expectations for our recently launched Sky Fit package as well. Both are affordably priced, entry-level postpaid products that allow the subscriber to add selected additional products and services on top. One year ago, our lowest priced postpaid package in Brazil was priced at 79.9 Reais versus the Sky Fit today which sells for 49.9 Reais or roughly 35% less. And yet, our programming margin on Sky Fit is consistent with our other packages, and I believe it is a testament to our ability to profitably serve the middle market segment. Prepaid gross additions represented 18% of our 525,000 gross adds in the quarter or 31% greater than last year. Cumulatively, prepaid subscribers makeup approximately 10% of our 5.4 million consolidated subscribers.
I was also pleased that our postpaid churn for the quarter of 1.54% met our expectations, while remaining relatively flat compared with the prior year. With regard to our prepaid services, as expected, we did see a decline in our recharge rates following the end of the World Cup. But as we have discussed before, we believe that giving this segment of consumers the option to sign up for pay-TV when they can afford it is still a good business for us, given the low net subscriber acquisition of costs associated with this group. We expect many of them will come back on in the months ahead, now that we have passed the natural lull of the post-World Cup periods.
We ended the quarter with 206,000 net adds. While this figure does not match the record we set last quarter in the run-up to the World Cup, it wasn't all that long ago that 206,000 net adds would have been a record. In fact, this is only the fourth time in our history that we have exceeded 200,000 net adds in a quarter, and it is still almost 30% better than we did last year.
We also had excellent financial results in the quarter, driven by a strong subscriber growth, revenues increased to 22%. ARPU was down modestly in dollars, due mostly to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU would have increased around 4%, driven by price increases and higher penetration of advanced products. OPBDA and cash flow before interest and taxes were even stronger as they grew 57% and 85%, respectively, over last year's results. The majority of this growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition cost associated with the increase in gross adds.
Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May, the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of a so-called parallel market for converting bolivars to U.S. dollars. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars, which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. As of September 30, we had approximately $120 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official 4.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar that is currently not available for repatriation. The currency control situation in Venezuela remains fluid and obviously, one we will continue to monitor closely. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can. Finally, I would like to make a few comments about the results of Sky Mexico, which are not consolidated in our results.
As some of you may already know, Sky Mexico continues to post extremely strong results, following the World Cup, adding more than 300,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 23,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 8.2 million subscribers. Financial results of Sky Mexico were equally strong, as revenue and OPBDA grew 20% and 34%, respectively.
So in summary, we had another very solid quarter, with continued strong subscriber growth across all three platforms, the diversified mix of product sales and strong financial results across the board. As a result, I remain confident that we are on track to meet the full year guidance we provided in our last earnings call. Pat?"

Much like Latin America, likely in the U.S. also had a very solid quarter and in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year, as our subscriber growth accelerated from the levels seen earlier in the year, while a",1334,"Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, likely in the U.S. also had a very solid quarter and in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year, as our subscriber growth accelerated from the levels seen earlier in the year, while at the same time, we continued generating strong margins.
Starting first with subscribers. We reversed the five quarter trend of declining year-over-year net additions by growing 28% to 174,000 net new customers, as both our gross additions and churn rate were better than prior year. Gross additions of 1.14 million were particularly strong, and represented the best third quarter in six years. As Mike mentioned earlier, we attribute the strong demand to a combination of factors, including the introduction of new services such as the Whole-Home DVR, popular offers such as FREE HD, and more targeted incentives designed to exploit competitor weaknesses, while capitalizing on DIRECTV's strength. The strength of our direct sales and retail channels continue to more than offset the declining contribution from our telco partners. Even with the addition of CenturyLink, telco's contribution has gradually declined over the past year, and is currently only about 15% of total gross addition compared to a high of 25% in the first half of last year.
This decline is mostly related to the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse, as well as the reduced number of landline, which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at the telco call centers. We are also pleased with our average monthly churn rate of 1.7%, which for the first time in six quarters, was lower on a year-over-year basis. We saw favorable trends in both voluntary and involuntary churn. The main reason for the improvement is that we're managing churn in a more proactive, segmented and targeted fashion. We now have an improved customer relationship management system, where our agents have better tools and information to communicate more effectively with our customers. We also have more intelligence on the front end, including a sophisticated predictive model, which provides us with the ability to identify those customers who are most likely to churn, so that we can implement action plan to mitigate losses.  In addition, we're constantly looking for ways to further tighten our credit standards or introduce new tactics to reduce involuntary churn. For example, in order for our customers to receive the FREE HD offer, they have to sign up for Auto Bill Pay, which historically has been associated with lower churn rates.
Turning now to ARPU. The 4.3% growth was double last year's third quarter and consistent with our internal target. As predicted, the rate was modestly below our first-half growth, mostly due to all around tougher comparisons with the prior year, as well as a couple of one-time events including an extra NFL game and acceleration of our price increase by one month. Consistent with trends seen in recent quarters, premiums, pay-per-view movies and advertising sales remained strong in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, year-over-year buy rates increased for premium and pay-per-view movies for the second consecutive quarter.
Our subscriber VOD movies, movie revenues remained about half as much as cable, so I'm happy to see we're making progress in this area even before we ramp up marketing for our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service. Also contributing nicely to ARPU growth is the increase in demand from both new and existing customers for advanced services. You heard earlier that about 75% of new customers are activating with advanced services. Even though many of these customers are receiving HD for free, virtually all of them are signing up for DVR services for an extra $7 per month and many are taking our Whole-Home DVR service for an extra $3 per month. We're seeing many of these same trends with existing customer, which help explain the modest increase in our third quarter upgrade and retention cost.
Turning now to the bottom line. Pretax margin grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, but EBITDA margin declined by about a percentage point to 24% in the quarter, primarily due to higher growth additions and related increase in subscriber acquisition costs. As we've seen all year, our programming, subscriber services and broadcast operations costs were contained and well managed. I'll just explain the reason for our higher upgrade and retention cost, so I'd like to spend a minute discussing SAC. Of the $108 year-over-year increase in SAC, approximately 90% of that increase is related to the increased demand for advanced products. Included in this percentage are the higher relative cost of HD and DVR boxes, the additional equipment and installation cost related to the advanced dish, and also the extra commissions we pay dealers to acquire higher quality HD and DVR customers. There will likely be continued upward pressure on SAC related to our strategy to more aggressively connect customers, set-top boxes to the Internet beginning here in the fourth quarter.
It's important to point out that we make these investments only after completing a very rigorous analysis that concludes with a relatively high level of confidence that we will attain an attractive return on our investment. I believe those analytical process has a pretty good track record over the past few years of identifying areas where we can generate healthy financial returns by upgrading customers with advanced equipment. In fact, customers who have HD and DVR services continue to generate roughly twice the returns of basic customers due to the significantly better ARPU and churn.
More broadly, we believe that investing in advanced equipment or higher quality customers is the best use of our free cash flow to generate superior returns for our shareholders.  Looking quickly at DIRECTV U.S. cash flow in the quarter, the same things you heard earlier apply here, where the higher gross adds and demand for advanced equipment resulted in higher capital expenditures and lower cash flow.  
I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our fourth quarter outlook. You just heard Bruce reaffirm DIRECTV Latin America's full year outlook, so these comments apply to our U.S. business. In many ways, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're anticipating revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter, as gross and net additions are again expected to be better than prior year. Pre-SAC margin is expected to have its usual sequential decline from the third to the fourth quarter related to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET costs. In fact, it's expected to see continued upward pressure as  I discussed earlier.
In terms of DIRECTV's consolidated free cash flow, we expect to exceed our initial full year estimate of mid-single digit growth. We're estimating that we'll receive a benefit of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter related to the most recent economic stimulus program that extended the accelerated write-off of equipment for another year. Also, keep in mind that we are expecting to make a payment for the acquisition of an additional 19% ownership in Sky Brazil from Globo in the fourth quarter. This will be reported under investing activities and therefore, not included in our reported free cash flow metric.
Regarding our balance sheet and strategy for returning capital to shareholders, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of reaching 2.5x leverage target by the end of next year. With the $3 billion raise in the third quarter, our leverage ratio of total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPBDA now stands at about 2x. This ratio also reflects the $1.2 billion repayment of all of our remaining secured debt in the quarter. Finally, through yesterday, we have repurchased approximately $680 million out of our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization.  Year-to-date, we've repurchased about $4.2 billion, while reducing our shares outstanding by some 12%. Cumulatively, we've now reduced DIRECTV shares by about 40% since we began our buyback program in 2006.
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Jon, so he can begin our Q&A session."

I would certainly tell you, and I think I commented on this on the call, I think the big news is, in my mind, there is a segment of consumers out there, in our case, it's the ones we targeted that upper income, the premier that pay for the premium service that are investing in their home entertainment system, if you will. They're investing with advanced products. They're investing with our MRV system, which we had almost 290,000 new customers taking MRV in the quarter. They are investing with HD DVR in a huge way, the almost 50% of our gross adds took HD DVR. That's way up from where it was a year ago, and they're also investing by buying pay-per-view movies. Our pay-per-view Movie business was up over 30%, as well as Premium business, which is up in the take rates, penetration rates on that are up as well. So I think we're certainly seeing a general interest in the overall quality entertainment experience that DIRECTV can provide our customers, and I think that's really been a key part of our success, I would say, coupled with our kind of NFL SUNDAY TICKET, and FREE HD promotion that we had in the quarter."

Clearly, the MRV success is there. You have a couple of other products coming out and obviously, connect set-tops included a lot of investment in the home around installation work. Are you going to settle with this at all, or do you sort of look at this and say, where we are in the cost curve, it still makes sense to sell these to whoever wants them, both in the installed base and in terms of gross adds? And so if the demand's there, we're going to move it or are you going to look to kind of moderate this and balance kind of near-term financial profits? I look to just understand how you're thinking about that. And then on the SUNDAY TICKET offer and just qualitatively, how did you guys do with the offer at the beginning of the season? The reason I asked is the NFL has done a pretty good job of making a lot of money everywhere they can in different windows. There's a lot of advertising with Verizon wireless and RED ZONE CHANNEL's available in a lot of places, the NFL Network is getting more distribution. Some people would argue that SUNDAY TICKET's being diluted by all these of other stuff, but I know you had a very good year last year and you've changed pricing around this year. So I'm just curious, how SUNDAY TICKET's going?"

I think on the first question, look, we look very carefully. The nature of our business model as you know, then you'll have to constantly be looking at -- we almost look at our investment in SAC, like it's a CapEx, like it's a capital expenditure because it is. And it has a certain revenue stream that we can model for our customers and certain churn projections based on whether they're advance services and all kinds of things. They have sophisticated modeling approach to that. I can assure you, we look very carefully at our ROI on all of these advanced products and as Pat said in his remarks, the ROI is more than double what it is for a basic subscriber and I don't think, however, that means, therefore, SAC can go to infinity. We look very carefully at it. We're very disciplined in how we manage it. But again, we've got a product that consumers want right now, and it has a terrific ROI to it. Pat?"

I mean, we expected it to be an attractive product, but it really resonated with our customers. So on the new customer side, it's a pretty easy proposition, and I think with the incremental revenue we get there and the experience in churn, that's an easy one. We continue to monitor existing customers that want to upgrade to MRV because, again, depending on the technology in their home, that could be different proposition or it just doesn't make sense for some people to upgrade to MRV. But that one, I mean, we, again, we're very comfortable on gross adds, very good return on that one because again, if you remember, that person's getting an HD DVR's probably got an HD box in the other room. And so he's paying us the $7, maybe the $10 for HD and the $3 for MRV. So the returns are very good there. Going in to like the fourth quarter where we're stressing broadband connectivity, I mean, I think as a team here, we're very bullish on the advantages of connecting boxes to the Internet. Again, we're offering it free for our very best customers. We're starting out in that way. we'll certainly monitor it, check our kind of financial projections on what we think that's going to drive as far as incremental revenue and a stickier customer. But I think again, we feel like this is kind of a must that it's important for our customers to have that total experience and being hooked up to broadband. But right now, we're very comfortable on these investments and the kind of returns they're going to generate for us."

And our VOD, I mean, the way we look at the connecting to the Internet as a strategy, and we'll talk about that in December, is it really unlocks for us an area we've been disadvantaged versus the cable guys for years. Our VOD on-demand revenues per sub are less than half of what an average cable company gets. We think that's a big opportunity, a big incremental revenue opportunity and profit opportunity for us in the years ahead as we pursue that strategy. On the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, let's keep in mind, first of all, it is a very important partnership that we have had with the NFL for many, many years. We value that partnership. And the branding of NFL SUNDAY TICKET and its role in our DIRECTV services, it plays a very important role from an overarching branding standpoint. Having said that, I would say that our NFL SUNDAY TICKET results were acceptable in the quarter. They weren't outstanding, by any stretch of the imagination. I would say we saw some modest falloff in renewals, but we have strong gross adds in the quarter, and about 25% of our gross adds took the ticket. We had a good experience, I think, with our NFL mobile offering, where we had almost 350,000 customers in the quarter, and I think we're getting a lot of learning about that as we look in the years ahead.

And then Bruce, the growth in Latin America continues to obviously be pretty excellent, so two things happen when you grow this fast this long, right? First, you start to -- we all start to get concerned that the strong growth will suggest that competitors that this is a bigger market than they thought, and they start to ramp up for this to get in the market. And second, you start to segment the customer base to continue to improve penetrations, which you've obviously done quite well. So that starts to suggest that maybe you flushed out a lot of growth and growth will start to slow. So the question is, are competitors ramping efforts in video in Latin America, and can you sustain this level of growth? And if so, how do you do that?"

I mean, in every market, we compete against generally one large cable company that, in some cases, is owned by a company for example like Telmex or Telefónica . In other cases, it's an independent cable company. So it's not as if the competition isn't already there. And in fact, in the case of Brazil, for example, several of the telcos have launched a fairly modest DTH platforms. So I'm aware of the competition. I think we continue to compete very well, and I think it goes back to a point that I've made probably over and over again on some of these calls that some of you may be tired of hearing me it which is, the key advantage we have is our product is just better. We have the advantage of taking all of the products in the R&D that is developed for the benefit of DIRECTV in the U.S, which is the world's most competitive pay-TV market, and we're able to bring it to Latin America sooner, better and cheaper than everybody else. So I'm very confident that from a competitive point of view, we will continue to do more than hold our own. On the second point about market growth, I think that you have to keep in mind a couple of things. One, you're correct about our ability to get into new segments and then particularly, more middle market segments, which I talked about. I think the other thing you have to remember is, in many markets, particularly Brazil, for example, there is a sort of a macroeconomics phenomenon going on, where a lot of people are rising from more lower or mass-market segments into middle market segments. So people moving from D&E [developing & emerging] class holds into C&D [construction and development]. And so the actual pie that all of us in this business are going after is increasing, so it is not like the United States, where you have very high penetration, and you're really fighting for share. I mean, the pay TV penetration is up in Latin America, but it's still in the mid -- the high 20s percentage points. It's not anything close to the saturation point. So assuming continued relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions, I think there's still a lot of running room to grow."

So I think if you're going to look at revenue growth, my guess is, it's going to be driven more by subscriber growth and ARPU growth without getting too specific about it either."

I think our premium service, I think we would expect to continue to see ARPU growth with the premium service. But what we constantly look at is how many new subscribers we are you bringing in, and when you've got an industry like Brazil, we're going to get less than 15% of the customers that take pay-TV in general. You've got an enormous opportunity to explode the base of the pyramid, what we want to be is very disciplined as we kind of look at these lower price packages and make sure there's a good return on them. And so we'll talk about it next year when we get around it, talking about next year. But I think it's kind of a balance you've got to keep in mind, as Bruce said, between a lot more subscribers, but will come in, in these lower price packages or prepaid versus the premium service, which is also growing."

I guess, first, if you could help us quantify the exposure to Venezuela just in terms of the percentage of the sub-base and revenue and EBITDA relative to total Latin America. And then just if you repatriated cash hypothetically in Venezuela this quarter, how much were those charges have been? I mean, is the $9 million share from last quarter a good number? Just trying to understand the recurring margin impact if you assumed you repatriated all the free cash flow on a regular basis. And then just lastly on the margins in Latin America, aside from the lack of repatriation charges, do you think this new margin level is something that's more or less sustainable?"

I think as Michael alluded to earlier, given the repatriation constraints that we have there, our basic strategy is to hold onto that base, the markets not growing a ton, but nevertheless, we sort of prefer to focus on our existing base, and to the extent we have subscribers we can upgrade with advanced services, we'll do that, et cetera, as opposed in this fairly selling more in the middle market. I don't want to get really involved in the individual P&Ls of the countries. The cash, I mentioned earlier about the 120 million of cash is the official rate in Venezuela. We obviously wouldn't repatriate all of that. I mean, we do have ongoing liabilities in Venezuela, costs associated, we paid programming in local currency.  We have obviously, employees there, et cetera, so it's hard for me to estimate what the impact would have been. I mean, because it's also hard to estimate what the parallel rate would be. But if you were to look at it historically, it might be a sort of $20 million number probably that we could -- had we been able to, we might have incurred a number like that, but it's not again a huge meaningful number in the overall context of DIRECTV Latin America or DIRECTV.

And it's clear that the new dual revenue model for the broadcast business is here to stay. And that is going to drive up the cost of everyone's programming, as well as I think, driving up the consumer's pay-TV bill each month. In our case, we have been paying some re-trends on the non-owned and operated stations in the past. That's not to say there won't be meaningful increases, there will be, but it's not like we're starting from zero, which some of our cable competitors are. But I think this whole arena is why really you're going to see several things. I mean, all of us are having to take very, very tough measures on channels that we deem to either be less popular or new channels for that matter that not everybody can go up in price and value for money is going to be critical. We're going to be pushing hard for greater package flexibility. And I think you're going to see much greater scrutiny over MSN provisions on both packaging, as well as price. And lastly, I think we're a distributor or a retailer, if you will.

And then secondly, one of your real beautiful points is just to get for marketing in the commercial both in the U.S. whether you're marketing Russians or Texans.
