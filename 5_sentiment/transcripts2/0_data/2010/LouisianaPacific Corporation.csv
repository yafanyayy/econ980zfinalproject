Usually, I let Rick give the weather report and I'll let him do that for national. But we appreciate those who are participating, even though the East Coast has got some snow problems. As the operator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO and with me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts. As I usually do, I'll begin a discussion with a review of the financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year, then I will follow that with comments on the performance of our individual segments and then from selected balance sheet discussion items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we have been operating, his perspective on our most recent results and some thoughts on the outlook for 2010.As we have done in the past, this call is open to the public and we are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information. It should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I'll reference the slide numbers in my comments. Additionally, we did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information. And as you know, our Form 10-K will be filed around the first of March. I want to remind the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on the Slide 2 of the presentation. As we all know, over the last three years, it's been very difficult to forecast the housing environment, so our comments need to be taken in that context. Also, be aware of the discussion on our use of non-GAAP financial information, which is included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached does have some of the necessary reconciliations, and as I mentioned, we did file Form 8-K this morning that provided more of those reconciliations. We're not going to reread all these statements but I will incorporate it with this reference.Before I talk about our results for Q4 and the full year, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about what LP accomplished in this last year with our single-minded focus on cash. We entered the year with $215 million in cash and equivalents, short- and long-term investments and restricted cash. $126 million of this $215 million is what we identified as available. What this means is we reduced the total cash by the carrying value of our auction rate securities and by the amount of restricted cash. Using that same measure, we ended 2009 with $440 million in cash, $394 million of which was available under that definition. That's an increase of $268 million in a year where housing was down 39%. We talked about some of the things that we did to improve that balance sheet item. Clearly, there was net cash from financing activities that included the March senior secured note issuance, and the September equity offering offset by some of the bond repurchases that we did. The net amount here was $116 million. Operationally, and I'll get into the details here, each of our three operating segments improved significantly as measured by their adjusted EBITDA. 72% increase in OSB, 15% increase in EWP and over a doubling in our Siding business. We did collect the $80 million in tax refunds that we forecasted at the beginning of the year. We reduced our inventories across the system by over 25%, which released $50 million in cash. Late in the fourth quarter, we did sell a portion of our auction rate securities portfolio for $21 million in cash. We also released an additional $58 million in restricted cash that is now available for our use. Well, not what we expect, yet we did generate $8 million from asset sales, short of our expectations. We held capital expenditures and investments in our joint ventures to $10 million. Our selling and administrative expenses fell by 20%, a $27 million savings. And our Lean Six Sigma program continued to generate savings and improve our operations. With this balance sheet improvement and the lessons that we learned during this period, we remain very well positioned to respond whatever the market throws at us over the next several years. That is a preface, let me talk about earnings. On Slide 4 of the presentation, this looks at Q4 2009 results, compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $49 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $275 million for the quarter, 10% increase from the same quarter last year. The same period last year reported a net loss of $341 million or $3.31 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $250 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a $19 million loss in the quarter compared to a loss of $38 million in the same quarter last year. Lots of move in [ph] the tax rate and continuing operations between the quarters, the effective tax benefit rate in Q4 of 2009 was 27%. This is lower than we would expect, primarily as a result of a change in estimate due to the need to establish a valuation reserve against deferred state tax assets, because of the lack of taxable income in the past three years. Full impact of this valuation reserve was taken in Q4, as we needed to apply the estimated effective annual tax benefit rate to the full year results. Q4 2008, the tax benefit rate was only 12%. The cause of this low rate is primarily due to the non-deductibility of the $273 million goodwill write-off taken last year. Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment, the tax benefit rate in Q4 was 42%.Slide 5 is a discussion of special items in the quarter that are generally not attributable to our ongoing operations. In Q4 of 2009, we had a charge of $9 million to increase contingent liability reserves, which included a charge associated to the subleasing of certain office space, its environmental reserves at a closed site and an increase in the ABTco class action settlement reserves. We [ph] made an investment gain of $19 million on the portfolio on the sale of the auction rate security portfolio that I talked about, and I'll discuss this further in a few minutes. And then we did announce that we would have a $21 million loss on the early extinguishment of the debt related to the equity clawback that we completed in October of last year. In 2008, the items included the impairment of $27 million on the auction rate security portfolio, the write-up of the goodwill that I just mentioned, and other operating charges and credits related to severance, and rightsizing charges and an increase in settlement reserves.Slide 6 shows our annual results for 20009 reporting a net loss of $121 million or $1.12 per share, compared to a loss of $579 million or $5.62 per share in 2008. The effective tax benefit rate for 2009 was 35% and 26% for '08. The primary difference between the years again, is related to the non-deductibility of goodwill in 2008. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the full year of 2009 was a loss of $44 million compared to a loss of $155 million in 2008, over a 70% improvement by housing starts being lower by nearly 40%. Slide 7 is a discussion of the special item compared for the two years. For 2009, the items are very similar to what I discussed in Q4. 2008, we recorded $119 million total write-down on the ARS portfolio, wrote up the goodwill, and then, we had other operating charges and credits that included the OSB settlement reserve and the previously discussed reserve increases in severance and rightsizing charges.Let me talk about our segments now. Slide 8 is the OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter, which is a 45% improvement compared to a $31 million operating loss in Q4 of last year, with a 16% increase in volumes and an average sales price that was 5% lower. This improvement is directly attributable to the actions that we have taken over the last year to adjust our operations and to focus on cash. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $22 million in Q4 of last year. Compared to Q3, volumes were lower by 4% and price also decreased by 4%. For the full year, OSB had an operating loss of $66 million compared to a loss of $155 million for the same period last year, despite our sales being down 35%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was a negative $30 million compared to a loss of $104 million during 2008, an improvement of over 70%.Slide 9 of the presentation is our Siding segment, which includes SmartSide and Canexel and commodity OSB produced paper [ph]. For the fourth quarter, Siding had operating income of $5 million, significantly better than the $11 million loss in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $9 million compared to a loss of $7 million in Q4 of 2008. For the quarter, sales were up 13% with unit volumes better by 19% in SmartSide, and down slightly in Canexel compared to the same quarter last year. In terms of sales price, the 25% increase in Canexel is a combination of change in mix. We eliminated our Door Skin business which had a lower price point in the middle of last year, and we also had an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate, as much of this product is sold in Canada. For the year, Siding had operating income of $29 million compared to $3 million in 2008, a tenfold improvement in results. Sales in 2009 were 12% lower than the prior year. And the adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for this segment had doubled to $48 million compared to $24 million in 2008. Slide 10 is our Engineered Wood business. And as a reminder, this includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This segment does include the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q4, EWP reported a loss of $9 million compared to a loss of $12 million in Q4 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $6 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $8 million for the same quarter last year. Volumes of I-Joist were up slightly, while volumes of LVL/LSL were up quite a bit compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is only slightly related to housing. In the quarter, we did sell a significant volume of non-structural LSL starter board that skewed these numbers from a volume percentage. Pricing was up 2% in I-Joist and down a bit in LSL but the decline in the LVL/LSL pricing was due to the non-structural starter board that I just discussed. For the year, EWP had an operating loss of $33 million, an improvement from the $40 million loss in 2008. Sales however, were lower by a third in 2009, proportional to the decline in housing starts. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing EWP operations for the year was $21 million compared to a loss of $24 million last year. Our other building products, there's no slide in this presentation, but let me make a few comments. Overall, we lost about $1 million in both Q4 of '09 and '08. For the quarter, sales were at $31 million, up 50% from the $20 million recording Q4 of last year. For the full year, we had operating income in this segment of about $1 million compared to a loss of $7 million in 2008, with sales increasing by 21%. Some of the other items, we did have a $3 million foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to a $13 million gain at the same quarter last year. As a reminder, in 2008, we had $125 million Canadian loan that was repaid late in the fourth quarter, that was denominated in Canadian dollars, the Canadian rate dropped and this was the reason for the realized gain.Investment income, excluding the gain on the sale of ARS in the quarter, was about $6 million compared to $7 million in the quarter last year. Interest expense was about $6 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 2008, primarily due to the high cost refinancing completed in Q1. Selling and administrative costs for the quarter were $32 million compared to $26 million in the same quarter of last year. There were several factors that contributed to this increase, but the most significant is related to management incentive pay. In 2008, we reversed the year-to-date accrual as it became evident that for the second year in a row, LP would not be making these payments. Q4 of 2009, incentive pay was earned based on substantially exceeding the cash target, that was the focal point of the incentive plan, and the year-end true-up was included in other expenses. Other year-end accruals included higher than anticipated health and welfare costs, and slightly higher pension expense. For the full year as I mentioned, selling and administrative costs were lower by 20%, a savings of $27 million compared to last year.Slide 11 of the presentation is balance sheet. Key balance sheet statistics, as I mentioned, cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash were $440 million, more than double the $215 million that we had at the end of last year. Working capital was about $535 million. For this year, this does include assets held for sale as a current asset, on the theory that these assets will be converted to cash in the next 12 months. We had net cash of over $160 million compared to a net debt position of $35 million at the end of 2008. Capital expenditures for the year of $10 million and book value per ending [ph] share was $9.92. This does reflect the impact of the additional shares issued in our equity offering in late September.Before I turn it to Rick, let me make a few other comments on our ABL, subsequent to year end, we did modify our ABL agreement so that we no longer have to defeat the $60 million bond payment that is due on August, 2010. We did file an 8-K on that last week. As we've discussed in the last call, Congress did implement the ability to carry back five years and we will be doing that with our carryback losses from 2009 to earlier years. For LP, we intend to receive a federal refund of about $45 million in the first half of this year. The last item I just want to touch on, and we will have more disclosure in our Form 10-K, is qualified special purpose entities. Based on new accounting pronouncements related to the joint ventures and these special purpose entities that become effective in Q1 of this year, we are anticipating that we will bring back this off-balance sheet arrangement onto the books of LP. This arrangement has been fully disclosed in LP's notes of the financial statements since this was put in place in 2003. Essentially, what this means is we will record $410 million of notes receivable and $366 million of notes payable. The difference is already recorded on LP's books as an investment and/or advances to an affiliate. This will be eliminated due to the gross-up. Fundamentally, this will not result in any change to our net equity position. With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

I want to welcome all of you to our end of the year earnings call. My prepared remarks this morning, I am going to spend some time wrapping up and reflecting on 2009, make a few comments relative to Q4 '09 to Q4 '08, and then share with you some observations and perspectives of how I think 2010 will unfold. Let me start by giving you might cut on 2009.I'd be less than honest with you if I didn't admit upfront that I am very happy to put 2009 in the books and behind us. It was the most chaotic year that I have experienced in my 33 years in the industry. And it was a very, very difficult year in which nothing came easy. Going into '09, we knew that we had a couple of very important things to accomplish in addition to the normal pleasing of customers, and the manufacturing and selling of building products. We knew that we had to shore up the balance sheet and preserve, conserve and generate cash. As Curt said, we began '09 with about $215 million in total cash of which about $126 million was available cash. That situation coupled with the unprecedented low level of business in building products, the predicted losses that we were anticipating and the debt maturity that was coming at us in August of 2010, I think influenced our stock price all the way down to a low last year of about $1.03 early in the year, as the S&P had bottomed. We focused our management incentives in the organization on cash preservation and generation, exclusive of the refinancing activities and more or less managed our entire set of businesses for cash in 2009. In early spring, we were able to complete as you know, a public debt offering that allowed us to push out the majority of our debt obligations until 2017. Because of the financial crisis hitting Wall Street, our debt deal did become quite difficult, it was also quite expensive. It was necessary and we did get it done. Fortunately, we did have the foresight to put an equity clawback provision into that deal. And in the fall, after more stability returned to the financial markets and our stock had rebounded as a result of LP showing improved results and more staying power, we did a follow-on equity offering that priced at $6.75. And we were able to retire a third of that expensive debt at a discount, and we relieved ourselves of about $17 million of interest charges going forward. Towards the end of the year, we were also able to free up some restricted cash from our Chilean operation and tendered some of our auction rate securities to the issuers to free up more cash, and our operations, as Curt said again, generated another $50 million in inventory reductions through their efforts. So at the end of 2009, we had $440 million in cash and a little over $390 million of available cash that has made our entire balance sheet much stronger than it was a year ago. Needless to say, it was not a year that any of us would care to repeat. I think housing starts all-in sugared out last year at about 550,000, that's down around 39% from 2008. LP's net sales were down a little over 23%. The entire year was characterized by managing our capacity to our customers' immediate needs and our employees' focused discipline on spending and inventory reduction. OSB reduced its operating loss 58% on less volume and lower sales in 2009, Siding improved its operating profits over 10x and Engineered Wood reduced its operating losses by 17% in that environment. South America moved from a loss in 2008 to a profit in 2009. There were some bright spots for us in 2009 in the face of mostly adversity. LP had its best year in safety in its history. We ended up the year with a TIR of 0.67 with all of our businesses under 1.0 for the first time. And that's an accomplishment that all of our employees are proud of, considering the amount of change and up and down of our facilities. 43% of our facilities went incident-free throughout the year. In environmental compliance, we experienced only two notices of violation for the year, which is one of our best performances. Our Lean Six Sigma efforts continued to pay off for us with a 7.5 to one return in 2009. And in CapEx, we had little activity as forecasted and ended up the year with a spend of $10 million. Our sales and marketing group ended up the year with about 1,800 new wins. A win is defined as a new product placement with an existing customer or adding a new customer with a product placement. In our calculation of a four quarter rolling year-over-year change of LP product volumes divided by the housing start number, all of our product categories were up, except OSB sheathing. Some were up significantly. TechShield was up 24% and SmartSide was up 42%. Sheathing being modestly down did not surprise us, as we turned away some sales volume this last year, because it was simply not good business for us. In big-box retail, sales dollars with Home Depot and Lowe's are specialty products of siding and molding were up in 2009 against 2008. LP ended the year with 3,956 employees, down another 713 from the year 2008. As a result, I think of the very depressed housing market, seasonality set in early in Q4 and heavily affected our Q4 quarter in siding. Our reporting segments did all perform better in Q4 than Q4 of '08, but it was still a relatively weak quarter when coupled with the adjustments and the end-of-the-year noise that Curt has already mentioned. Of operating significance in Q4, our Hanceville, Alabama mill lost 31 days of operating time due to log outages caused by the weather in the South. We were also close to running out at Roxboro, North Carolina but did not. We made the decision to go ahead this quarter and put the permanently closed label on two of our OSB mills, which had been in the indefinitely shut category. That's Athens, Georgia and Silsbee, Texas. This is about 725 million square feet of rated capacity that moves into the permanently shut graveyard that has been created by this downturn. Left indefinitely shut in our stable is our Chambord, Quebec mill and our new mill in Clarke County in Alabama. Between Christmas and New Year's, we started our second mill in Chile back up, the Lautaro mill, that wood [ph] mill was constructed in 2008. The Chilean economy is picking back up and they have elected their first pro-business President. We plan to run Lautaro at least four months this year, and obviously hope that the demand for the product is such that we can run it longer. Panguipulli, our first mill constructed in Chile about 10 years ago is running full. I'll finish my comments with some thoughts on 2010. We have made our plans for 2010 based upon an assumption of 700,000 new residential starts all-in, that's single-family, multi-family and manufactured housing, and about 160,000 new residential starts in Canada. It's our opinion that the housing market will ebb and flow over the next several quarters as it slowly improves. Any recovery in new residential starts will be constrained by lingering foreclosures, slow home price appreciation, continued high unemployment and credit that is just hard to get. This makes the short-term outlook difficult to the call, given the departure from any historical norms. Now 2010 does begin with a few favorable influences compared to this time last year. The tax credit is in place this year for homebuyers, which was not in place in Q1 of '09. This may pull forward some buying into the first half of the year. The distribution channels are buying our products. After working through the process of redeploying their inventories, from shuttered locations to those that remained open last year. Supply and demand have had another season to become more in sync, and random length pricing is better than last January and February. Our orders in Siding are also stronger than the same time last year.Our management incentives for 2010 are being built around being adjusted EBITDA positive for the year, and I think that's an improvement. The Canadian housing market appears to be more normal this year, but FX with the Canadian dollar has begun the year less favorable than it was this time last year. Currently, our assumptions around wood costs are that they will net out relatively flat year-to-year, after seeing some increases in Q1 in the South due to the wet weather. The exceptionally wet weather in the South has us fighting for log deliveries at both Hanceville and Roxboro.  Currently, our assumptions around wood cost or that they will net out relatively flat year-to-year after seeing some increases in Q1 in the South due to the wet weather. The exceptionally wet weather in the South has us fighting for log deliveries at both Hanceville and Roxboro.  We do expect to give up some of our cost gains that we made in 2009 in resins, waxes, borate, plastic. And electricity continues to escalate. In 2010, we expect CapEx spend to be less than $25 million. We are beginning the quarter with both Dawson Creek, British Columbia OSB mill and the Swan Valley Manitoba OSB mills down for the months of January and February. We were unable to accomplish what we set out to do in 2009 around asset sales. That was the bad news. The good news is we will continue to pursue completely in those efforts in 2010 and have that upside in cash ahead of us, should we be more successful this year. Underway are the marketing of our permanently closed Saint-Michel OSB complex, a building that we own in Franklin, Tennessee and our Selma extrusion facility. And now we will add to that list our Athens and Silsbee facilities. Finally, last week at LP's Board of Directors meeting, John Weaver was elected as a member of our board. John is the recently retired Executive Chairman of AbitibiBowater. John spent his career in the forest industries and worked in Canada for the last 13 years. We are happy to have him aboard to provide his perspective and counsel. So in general, I think that we're more optimistic than we were a year ago. It is a measured optimism to be sure, but it feels like we have the worse behind us in almost every aspect. The biggest difference Q1 with last year to Q1 of this year is simply that a sale in the marketplace creates an order at the manufacturing level. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Curt."

I think there's probably a little bit more on the higher cost side and lower, but relatively that. We expect resins to be up, principally because oil is up and very volatile. And it's not just oil, it's the derivatives, being phenol and benzene, primarily for the resins.

As the operator said, I am Curt Stevens, the Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Rick Frost, LP’s CEO; as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barkley, our primary investor relations contacts.
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2010, and I will follow this with comments on some of our individual segments, and selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over give you the weather report for Nashville and then discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our most recent operating results and his thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of 2010.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a web cast. This can be accessed at our website www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments. We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we just filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter.
First thing on these slides, I like to remind all participants about the forward-looking statement comment that is included on slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The Appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations and those have been supplemented by the Form 8-K we filed this morning. I am not going to reread these statements, but I am going to incorporate it with these references.
Slide 4 of the presentation is a discussion of our Q1 2010 results compared to the same quarter of last year and the prior quarter. We are reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Our net sales from continuing operations were $300 million for the quarter. For the same period last year we reported a net loss of $30 million or $0.29 per diluted share, and sales from continuing operations of $206 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the first quarter of 2009. There was some movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 was 31%. This is primarily the result of the blended rate between jurisdictions with profits in foreign subsidiaries, tax at lower rates and losses in North America in operations.
Q1 of 2009, the tax benefit rate was 39%, basically it is the statutory rate. Had the tax benefit rate in Q1 been the same as last year, net earnings per share would have been improved by about $0.03 a share.
Now let me discuss performance of each of our segments. Slide five of the presentation is a summary of OSB. OSB had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to $24 million operating loss in Q1 2009. For the quarter, we had a 34% increase in volume, and an average sales price that was 26% higher than the same quarter last year. This resulted in a $24 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA.
The strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increases our costs more than revenue due to sales being in the US, hurt our earnings in this segment by about $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a positive $4 million compared to a loss of $17 million in Q1 of last year. Compared to Q4 of 2009, volumes were lower by 14%, while pricing increased by 22%. Volumes in Q1 were constrained by the availability of logs in the US South due to extremely wet weather conditions that occurred during the quarter.
Slide 6 of the presentation is our siding segment, which includes our SmartSide and Canexel siding products and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the first quarter siding had operating income of $9 million, significantly better than the $2 million reported in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the siding segment was $14 million compared to $7 million in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter sales were up 20% and unit volumes were better by 29% in SmartSide and down by about 15% in Canexel compared to the same quarter last year.
Reductions in volumes for our Canexel product line was caused by a decision to not to run one of the production lines for working on process improvements. This has limited our available products and customers on allocation for Canexel.
For the quarter SmartSide average sales prices were up slightly due to product mix with individual product prices remaining relatively flat. Canexel prices show a pretty significant increase at 24%, but this is largely due to this product being sold in Canada and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased the US equivalent sales price.
Slide 7 of the presentation is our engineered wood, which includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, produced at our main facility, and Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This segment does include the sale of I-Joists and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q4 EWP recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million, about half of what we recorded in Q1 of 2009 and Q4 of 2009.
Volumes of I-Joist were up significantly, 88%, while LVL and LSL were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The increases were tied to the increase in housing, as well as during the quarter we did see significant inventory building in the channel after dramatic reductions in 2009.
Pricing was down slightly in I-Joist, but up about 4% in LVL and LSL. Another building product in this category includes our interior molding business, our South American operations and the US GreenFiber joint-venture and some non-operating facilities. Overall, we were slightly positive in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year.
For the quarter, sales for these operations were $41 million, up 45% from the $28 million recorded in Q1 of last year. Some other items, we did have a small foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to $2.6 million gain in the same quarter of last year. Investment income in the quarter was about flat between periods, with returns down significantly, but cash balances were higher.
Interest expense was nearly $17 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in Q1 of 2009. This is primarily due to the higher cost of refinancing that we completed late in Q1 of 2009.
Slide 8 of the presentation shows some balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents and investments and restricted cash were $414 million the end of the quarter, working capital about $520 million.
We had net cash over debt of $136 million and capital expenditures were a relatively modest $4 million in the quarter. Book value per ending share was $9.73. I do want to mention as I did in our earnings call at the end of February that we did have a balance sheet (inaudible) that occurred in Q1, and was reflected retrospectively for prior periods. This was due to a change in accounting standard.
We added back our previously qualified special-purpose entity, an entity called LP Pinewood [ph] that was off balance sheet and now it is back on the balance sheet. This entity was put in place in 2003 to defer the income taxes paid on the sale of LP Southern Timberland. By adding this back, we increased our assets by $368 million, increased our liabilities by a like amount, and reduced equity by about $1 million.
The overall transaction has been disclosed since the inception in our footnotes, but is now included in the balance sheet. This is to note the associated debt has little or no recourse to LP, as it is backed by a letter of credit, which is subsequently backed by cash.
A few other comments, before I give it to Rick, our federal tax refund as we discussed in the last call, we did do a rapid filing of our 2009 federal income tax return, and received a refund of about $47 million during the quarter. The balance sheet shows the remaining income tax receivables of about $6 million, and that will come back to LP over the next year or so.
On the auction rate securities, based on valuations received from third parties, we did increase the value of this portfolio by $10 million in the quarter, and as you know we're continuing to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. With that let me turn it over to Rick.

It is drizzling here in Nashville, but we're drying out after a week of sunshine last week. I am sure that you did see in the news that we had severe weather and a lot of rain in the middle of Tennessee area last week, and we had flooding of I guess, unprecedented nature. It was the worst flooding in history. I'm happy to report and relieved to report that we were fortunate that no LP employees suffered significant flood damage, but the town will take some time to recover.
I want to begin my brief prepared remarks this morning by adding a little bit of color to Q1 but not be redundant to what Curt has already said. On the safety front, we got off to a great start in the year, with only two recordable injuries across our system in Q1 and a TIR of 0.23. The other most significant event was that our Carthage OSB mill became the first OSB mill in history in North America to exceed 1 million incident free work hours.
Overall, financially we did eke out our first positive adjusted EBITDA Q1 since 2006, which felt good. The housing market ended the quarter with seasonally adjusted single family starts of about 530,000. Each of our three core businesses did improve financially from Q1 of 09, which was granted a pretty low hurdle to jump over, but they also improved over Q4 of 2009 as well.
I will make a few comments on each of our reporting segments for Q1. OSB did surprise us in Q1. Our customers’ needs were more robust than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Random lengths price [ph] across the six different sales regions moved upward $60 to $65 on a 7/16 inch basis during the quarter. Because of the lag effect, which is the time between order and delivery, we weren’t able to capture all of that move, but what we did capture helped us considerably.
Our Huntsville OSB Alabama mill was down 42 days in Q1 for log outages resulting from weather that was adverse to logging. Our TechShield radiant barrier OSB roof sheathing was 50% over Q1 ’09, and our TopNotch Sub-Flooring was up 24% from the same quarter last year.
We had two months that were indefinitely shut during the quarter, strand board [ph] and Clarke County, and the rest of our miles ran on various shifting schedules.
In siding, our SmartSide volume was up about 20% over Q1 2009 with slightly stronger sales price due to mix, and we think that bodes well for us for the rest of the year. As Curt mentioned, our Canexel fine fiber product reminds on allocation as we work to get our production scheduling back in balance.
In engineered wood products, the segment which is most heavily tied to new residential construction, we improved, which means we lost less money. At these volume levels this is still a distressed business segment. Plaguing this business at the present or the lack of starts and component raw material prices, which are outstripping finished product pricing. As you know, I-Joist is made from OSB webstock and flange lumber, and LVL is made from peeled veneer. All three of these core components have increased substantially in price, more so than finished product pricing.
In Chile, which I had an opportunity to visit in the first quarter, the earthquake affected our Lataro mill adversely with about a 17 day outage, but at present both of our Chilean mills are running full to feed the reconstruction effort that is needed there.
I will spend a few moments looking forward in terms of what we see coming at us and then we will open it up to questions. Obviously, the recent run-up in OSB pricing is going to positively affect the financial performance of our OSB business and LP overall in Q2. It has certainly been unexpected, but even at these demand and takeaway levels it is very significant to us.
But the housing market has experienced a welcome bump if you will. However, from what I read it is unlikely that substantial recovery towards the base underlying housing demand will be significant in 2010. I just reviewed a recent composite of the 2010 start forecast put together by APA, and that still does not break the 700,000 start level for 2010, although (inaudible) is still the outlier on this, having end of the year start level at about 850,000.
A couple of questions for us are yet unanswered. First, how much of the current housing activity is pulled forward cost by tax incentives, and the second is the channel building a little bit more of a position for the summer. Meanwhile, we're still looking at four large problems in the eye, the four that we have been looking at for a year now. The first is high unemployment, which last week came in at 9.9%; continued foreclosures; the excess for sale inventory of existing homes; and in general slower household formation. And because of these elements, we are still being quite cautious in our optimism around this recovery.
That said, I will turn it back over to Curt for the question period.

If you look at Q1, you know, you guys get various amounts of information, but I will refer to random lengths print, the year North Central began on a 7/16 basis at 182, and I think the quarter ended North Central’s 7/16 at 248. There are six different sales regions and prices during the quarter varied between $10 and $15 up or down from each other in those sales regions.
In the first quarter, the North Central was higher than all the other regions except for Western Canada. So our weighted average of sales may not equal the central pricing that some people seem to pick and look at obsessively. There is also a lag on pricing for open market wood. The way this works is that as order files extend, and order taken in one week may not actually be delivered for four weeks.
So in a climbing pricing environment, this creates a lag in terms of getting what may print on a Friday, it may take you however long way your order file is out to capture that particular price. So if the market moves very, very quickly you stay behind it. There was another influence that we had in terms of looking at that and that is that our value-added products tend to lag the market as well, because the pricing these products changes less rapidly.
We did have a high component of value-added in Q1 with TechShield and TopNotch, and then finally, I think the other thing that influences price, particularly as price becomes higher is that there are discounts on contracted wood on a percentage basis. So, at a higher number those percentages are higher dollars. So that is what happens when the market moves very, very rapidly in the up direction.

I think in terms of Chile from what we can tell it looks like about 300,000 residences were destroyed in that earthquake, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years worth of building. So in terms of what that has done for us, if you remember the last call I said we had just started Lataro, which is our second mill up in hopes of running it for the rest of the year.
We now feel quite confident that we will run both mills full out for a considerable period of time to help in that reconstruction. So, we did start Lataro up between Christmas and New Year's. Right after the earthquake, we added the fourth shift there as quickly as possible. So both Panguipulli and Lataro are running full. The other positive thing out of this catastrophe was that wood construction held up quite well.
So we think that it will continue to help us in our effort to convert building practices in Chile. We did spend sending about 4 million down from Canada to Chile in the immediate relief effort, and for some help to our Brazilian operation we are moving a couple of thousand cubic meters a month over from Brazil.
So Chile looks to be full speed ahead with both mills for the foreseeable future, meaning I would think at least a couple of years. In Brazil, we're running our Ponta Grossa mill at about 50% of capacity. When we bought that mill it was in need of some improvement. We do have one dryer and one thermal oil system, which is down and we're looking to perhaps start that dryer and that thermal oil system up somewhere in the fourth quarter to continue to fill in the success that we are having in selling OSB for non-construction purposes in Brazil.
In a concurrent effort, we are working through the bureaucratic red tape to qualify a building system in Brazil, what we are calling an OSB building system, which is if we are successful there it would allow us to then put LP OSB into that building system. There is huge pent-up demand in Brazil as I talked about last year, and why we went there. Currently we have about 7 million homes, and the need is projected for about 18 million homes over the next decade. So, we think that that is going to continue to get more attractive for us, but right now we are caught in this bureaucratic red tape.
In Brazil, they don't approve single products in their regulatory environment. They approve building systems. So we have been working on that now for about five or six months, and hopefully we will break through sometime this year.

As the operator said, I'm Curt Stevens, Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO, as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. I'll begin the discussion with the review of our financial results for the first quarter of 2010; then I'll follow this with comments on some of our individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over and give you the weather report for national and then discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating; his perspective on our most recent operating results and his thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of 2010.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at our website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided our presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I'll be referencing these slides in my comments. We had filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we just filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter.
First thing on this slide, I'd like to remind all participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Results of, be aware of our discussion, of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations, and those have been supplemented by the Form 8-K that we filed this morning. I'm not going to reread this statements but I am going to incorporate it with these references. 
Slide 4 of the presentation is a discussion of our Q1 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Our net sales from continuing operations of nearly $300 million for the quarter. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $30 million or $0.29 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $206 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the first quarter of 2009. There was some movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 was 31%. This is primarily the result of the blended rate between jurisdictions with profits from foreign subsidiaries, tax and lower rates and losses in North American operations. Q1 of 2009, the tax benefit rate was 39%, basically, the statutory rate. Has the tax benefit rate in Q1 been the same as last year, net earnings per share would have been improved about $0.03 a share.
Let me now discuss performance each of our segments. Slide 5 of the presentation is a summary of OSB. OSB had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to a $24 million operating loss in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, we had a 34% increase in volume and an average sales price that was 26% higher in the same quarter last year. This resulted in a $24 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increases our cost more than revenue due to sales being in the U.S., further our earnings in this segment by about $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a positive $4 million compared to a loss of $17 million in Q1 of last year.
Compared to Q4 of 2009, volumes were lower by 14% while pricing increased by 22%. Volumes in Q1 were constrained by the availability of logs in the U.S. South, due to extremely wet weather conditions that occurred during the quarter. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is our Siding segment, which includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and commodity OSB produced at our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $9 million, significantly better than the $2 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $14 million compared to $7 million in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 20% and unit volumes were better by 29% in SmartSide and down by about 15% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. Reductions in volume for our CanExel product line is caused by our decision not to run one of the production lines while working on process improvements. This has limited our available product and customers in our location in CanExel.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up slightly due to product mix with individual product pricings remaining relatively flat. CanExel prices show a pretty significant increase of 24%, but this is largely due to this product being sold in Canada and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar increase the U.S. sales price.
Slide 7 of the presentation, our engineered wood, which includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, produced at our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. Segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV are under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million, about half of what we recorded in Q1 of 2009 and Q4 of 2009.
Volumes of I-Joist were up significantly, 88%, while LVL/LSL were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase were tied to the increase in housing as well as during the quarter, we did see significant inventory building in the channel after dramatic reductions in 2009. Pricing was down slightly in I-Joist but up about 4% in LVL/LSL.
Our other building products. This category includes our interior moulding business, our South American operations and the U.S. GreenFiber Joint Venture in some non-operating facilities. Overall, we were slightly positive in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.6 million first quarter of last year. For the quarter, sales for these operations were $41 million, up 45% from the $28 million recorded in Q1 of last year. 
Some other items. We did have a small foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to $2.6 million gain in the same quarter last year. And then investment income in the quarter was about flat between periods, with returns down significantly but cash balances were higher. Interest expense was nearly $17 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in Q1 of 2009. This is primarily due to the higher cost refinancing that we completed late in Q1 of 2009. 
Slide 8 of the presentation shows some balance sheet items. Cash, cash equivalents, investments of restricted cash were $414 million into the quarter, working capital about $520 million. We had net cash over debt of $136 million, and capital expenditures were relatively modest $4 million in the quarter. Book value per ending share was $9.73.
I do want to mention as I did in our earnings call at the end of February that we did have a balance sheet growth that occurred in Q1 and was reflected retrospectively for prior periods. This was due to a change in accounting standard. We added back our previously qualified special purpose entity, an entity called LP Plywood, that was off-balance sheet and now it's back on the balance sheet. This entity was put in place in 2003 to defer the income taxes paid on the sale of LP's southern timberlands. By adding these back, we increased our assets by $368 million, increased our liability by a like amount and reduced equity by about $1 million.
The overall transaction has been disclosed since the inception in our footnotes but is now included in the balance sheet. This is the note, the associated debt had little or no recourse to LP as it is backed by a letter of credit, which is subsequently backed by cash. 
A few other comments before give to Rick, our federal tax refund, as we discussed in our last call, we did do a rap in filing 2009 federal income tax return and received a refund of about $47 million during the quarter. The balance sheet shows the remaining income tax receivable of about $6 million, and that will come back to LP over the next year or so. On the auction rate securities, based on valuations received from third parties, we did increase in the value of this portfolio by about $10 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are continuing to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. 
With that, let me turn over to Rick."

It is drizzling here in Nashville, but we are drawing out after a week of sunshine last week. I'm sure that you did see in the news that we had severe weather and a lot of rain in the middle Tennessee area last weekend, and we had plenty of, I guess, unprecedented nature. It was the worst flooding in history. I am happy to report and relieved to report that we were fortunate that no LP employee suffered significant flood damage, but the town will take some time to recover.
I want to begin my brief prepared remarks this morning by adding a little bit of color in Q1 but not be redundant to what Curt has already said. On the safety front, we got up to a great start in the year with only two recordable injuries across our system in Q1 and a TIR of 0.23. Other most significant event was that our Carthage OSB mill was the first OSB mill in history in North America to exceed 1 million incident free work hours. 
Overall, financially, we did eke out our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter Q1 since 2006, which felt good. The housing market ended the quarter with seasonally adjusted single-family starts of about 530,000. Each of our three core businesses did improve financially from Q1 of '09, which was granted a pretty low hurdle to jump over. But they also improved over Q4 of 2009 as well.
Make a few comments on each of our reporting segments for Q1. OSB did surprise us in Q1. Our customer's needs were more robust than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Random links sprint across the six different sales regions moved to upward, $60 to $65 on the 716 [indiscernible] bases during the quarter. Because of the lag effect, which is the time between order and delivery, we weren't able to capture all of that move, but what we did capture helped us considerably. 
Our Hanceville OSB Alabama mill was down 42 days in Q1 for log outages, resulting from weather that was adverse to logging. Our TechShield Radiant Barrier OSB roof sheathing was up 50% over Q1 '09, and our TopNotch Sub-Flooring was up 24% from the same quarter last year. We did have two mills that we're indefinitely shut during the quarter, Chambord and Clark County. And the rest of our mills ran on various shifting schedules.
In Siding, our SmartSide volume was up about 20% over Q1 2009, with slightly stronger sales price due to mix, and we think that bodes well for us for the rest of the year. As Curt mentioned, our CanExel fine fiber product remains on allocation as we work to get our production scheduling back in balance. 
In Engineered Wood Products, the segment which is most heavily tied to new residential construction, we improved, which means we lost less money. At these volume levels, this is still a distressed business segment. Plaguing this business at present are the lack of starts and component raw material prices [audio gap] which are outstripping finished product pricing. 
As you know, I-Joist is made from OSB web stock and flanged lumber and LVL is made from peeled veneer. All three of these core components have increased substantially in price, more so than finished product pricing. 
In Chile, which I had an opportunity to visit in the first quarter, the earthquake affected our Lautaro mill adversely with about 17-day outage. But at present, both of our Chilean mills are running full, to feed the reconstruction efforts that is needed there. 
I'll spend a few moments looking forward in terms of what we see coming at us and then we'll open it up to questions. Obviously, the recent run-up in OSB pricing is going to positively affect the financial performance of our OSB business and LP overall in Q2. It has certainly been unexpected, but even at these demand and takeaway levels, it is very significant to us. But the housing market has experienced a welcome bump, if you will. However, from what I read, it is unlikely that substantial recovery towards the base underlying housing demand will be significant in 2010. I just reviewed a recent composite of the 2010 start forecast put together by APA, and that still doesn't break the 700,000 start level for 2010. Although RISI is still the outlier on this, having the end of the year start level at about 850,000. 
Couple of questions for us are yet unanswered. First, is how much of the current housing activity is a pull-forward cost by tax incentives. And the second is the channel building a little bit more of a position for the summer. Meanwhile, we are still looking at four large problems in the eyes of four that we have been looking at for a year now. The first is high unemployment, which last week came in at 9.9%; continued foreclosures; the excess of for-sale inventory of existing homes and in general, slower household formation. And because of these elements, we're still being quite cautious in our optimism around this recovery. 
That said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question period."

If you look at Q1, you guys get various amounts of information, but I'll refer to Random Lengths’ print. The year, North Central began on a 7/16 basis at 182. And I think quarter ended North Central 7/16 at 248. There are six different sales regions. And prices during the quarter varied between $10 and $15 up or down from each other in those sales regions. In the first quarter, the North Central was higher than all other regions, except for Western Canada. So a weighted average of sales may not equal the North Central pricing that some people seem to pick and look at obsessively. There's also a lag on pricing for open market wood. The way this works is that as order files extend, an order taken in one week may not actually be delivered for 4 weeks. So in a climbing pricing environment, this creates a lag in terms of getting what may print on a Friday. It may take you, however long your order file is out to capture that particular price. So if the market moves very, very quickly, you stay behind it. There's another influence that we had in terms of looking at that and that is that our value-added products tend to lag the market as well because the price in these products changes less rapidly. We did have a high component of value-added in Q1 with TechShield and TopNotch. And then finally, I think the other thing that influences price, particularly as price becomes higher, is that there are discounts on contracted wood on a percentage basis. So at a higher number those percentages are higher dollars. So that's what happens when the market moves very rapidly in the up direction."

The other positive thing out of this catastrophe was that wood construction held up quite well. So we think that it will continue to help us in our effort to convert building practices in Chile. We did send about 4 million feet down from Canada to Chile in the immediate relief effort. And with some help to our Brazilian operation, we're moving a couple thousand cubic meters a month over from Brazil. So Chile looks to be full speed ahead with both mills for the foreseeable future, meaning, I would think at least a couple of years. In Brazil, we are running our Ponta Grossa mill at about 50% of capacity. When we bought that mill, it was in need of some improvement. We do have one dryer and one thermal oil system, which is down. And we are looking to, perhaps, start that dryer and that thermal oil system up somewhere in the fourth quarter to continue to fill in the success that we're having in selling OSB for non-construction purposes in Brazil. In a concurrent effort, we are working through the bureaucratic red tape to qualify a building system in Brazil, what we're calling, an OSB building system, which is if we’re successful there would allow us to then put LP OSB into that building system. There's a huge pent-up demand in Brazil, as I talked about last year and why we went there, currently, of about 7 million homes. And the need is projected for about 18 million homes over the next decade. So we think that that's going to continue to get more attractive for us. But right now, we're caught in this bureaucratic red tape. In Brazil, they don't approve single products. In their regulatory environment, they approve building systems. So we've been working on that now for about 5 or 6 months. And hopefully, we’ll break through sometime this year."

I'll begin the discussion with the review of our financial results for the first quarter of 2010; then I'll follow this with comments on some of our individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over and give you the weather report for national and then discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating; his perspective on our most recent operating results and his thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of 2010.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at our website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided our presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I'll be referencing these slides in my comments. We had filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we just filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter.
First thing on this slide, I'd like to remind all participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Results of, be aware of our discussion, of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations, and those have been supplemented by the Form 8-K that we filed this morning. I'm not going to reread this statements but I am going to incorporate it with these references. 
Slide 4 of the presentation is a discussion of our Q1 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Our net sales from continuing operations of nearly $300 million for the quarter. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $30 million or $0.29 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $206 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the first quarter of 2009. There was some movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 was 31%. It's primarily the result of the blended rate between jurisdictions with profits in foreign subsidiaries, tax at lower rates and losses in North American operations. Q1 of 2009, the tax benefit rate was 39%, basically, the statutory rate. Had the tax benefit rate in Q1 been the same as last year, net earnings per share would have been improved by about $0.03 a share.
Let me now discuss the performance of each of our segments. Slide 5 of the presentation is a summary of OSB. OSB had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to a $24 million operating loss in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, we had a 34% increase in volume at an average sales price that was 26% higher than the same quarter last year. This resulted in a $24 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increases our costs more than revenue due to sales being in the U.S., hurt our earnings in this segment by about $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a positive $4 million compared to a loss of $17 million in Q1 of last year.
Compared to Q4 of 2009, volumes were lower by 14% while pricing increased by 22%. Volumes in Q1 were constrained by the availability of logs in the U.S. South, due to extremely wet weather conditions that occurred during the quarter. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is our Siding segment, which includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and commodity OSB produced at our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $9 million, significantly better than the $2 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $14 million compared to $7 million in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 20% and unit volumes were better by 29% in SmartSide and down by about 15% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. Reductions in volumes for our CanExel product line was caused by our decision not to run one of the production lines while working on process improvements. This has limited our available product and customers are in allocation in CanExel.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up slightly due to product mix with individual product pricings remaining relatively flat. CanExel prices show a pretty significant increase at 24%, but this is largely due to this product being sold in Canada and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased the U.S. equivalent sales price.
Slide 7 of the presentation, our Engineered Wood, which includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, produced at our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. Segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV are under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million, about half of what we recorded in Q1 of 2009 and Q4 of 2009.
Volumes of I-Joist were up significantly, 88%, while LVL/LSL were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase were tied to the increase in housing as well as during the quarter, we did see significant inventory building in the channel after dramatic reductions in 2009. Pricing was down slightly in I-Joist but up about 4% in LVL/LSL.
Our other building products. This category includes our interior moulding business, our South American operations and the U.S. GreenFiber Joint Venture in some non-operating facilities. Overall, we were slightly positive in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.6 million first quarter of last year. For the quarter, sales for these operations were $41 million, up 45% from the $28 million recorded in Q1 of last year. 
Some other items. We did have a small foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to $2.6 million gain in the same quarter last year. And then investment income in the quarter was about flat between periods, with returns down significantly but cash balances were higher. Interest expense was nearly $17 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in Q1 of 2009. This is primarily due to the higher cost refinancing that we completed late in Q1 of 2009. 
Slide 8 of the presentation shows some balance sheet items. Cash, cash equivalents, investments of restricted cash were $414 million into the quarter, working capital about $520 million. We had net cash over debt of $136 million, and capital expenditures were relatively modest $4 million in the quarter. Book value per ending share was $9.73.
I do want to mention as I did in our earnings call at the end of February that we did have a balance sheet growth that occurred in Q1 and was reflected retrospectively for prior periods. This was due to a change in accounting standard. We added back our previously qualified special purpose entity, an entity called LP Plywood, that was off-balance sheet and now it's back on the balance sheet. This entity was put in place in 2003 to defer the income taxes paid on the sale of LP's southern timberlands. By adding these back, we increased our assets by $368 million, increased our liability by a like amount and reduced equity by about $1 million.
The overall transaction has been disclosed since the inception in our footnotes but is now included in the balance sheet. This is the note, the associated debt had little or no recourse to LP as it is backed by a letter of credit, which is subsequently backed by cash. 
A few other comments before give to Rick, our federal tax refund, as we discussed in our last call, we did do a rap in filing 2009 federal income tax return and received a refund of about $47 million during the quarter. The balance sheet shows the remaining income tax receivable of about $6 million, and that will come back to LP over the next year or so. On the auction rate securities, based on valuations received from third parties, we did increase in the value of this portfolio by about $10 million in the quarter.

It is drizzling here in Nashville, but we are drawing out after a week of sunshine last week. I'm sure that you did see in the news that we had severe weather and a lot of rain in the middle Tennessee area last weekend, and we had plenty of, I guess, unprecedented nature. It was the worst flooding in history. I am happy to report and relieved to report that we were fortunate that no LP employee suffered significant flood damage, but the town will take some time to recover.
I want to begin my brief prepared remarks this morning by adding a little bit of color in Q1 but not be redundant to what Curt has already said. On the safety front, we got up to a great start in the year with only two recordable injuries across our system in Q1 and a TIR of 0.23. Other most significant event was that our Carthage OSB mill was the first OSB mill in history in North America to exceed 1 million incident free work hours. 
Overall, financially, we did eke out our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter Q1 since 2006, which felt good. The housing market ended the quarter with seasonally adjusted single-family starts of about 530,000. Each of our three core businesses did improve financially from Q1 of '09, which was granted a pretty low hurdle to jump over. But they also improved over Q4 of 2009 as well.
Make a few comments on each of our reporting segments for Q1. OSB did surprise us in Q1. Our customer's needs were more robust than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Random links sprint across the six different sales regions moved to upward, $60 to $65 on the 716 [indiscernible] bases during the quarter. Because of the lag effect, which is the time between order and delivery, we weren't able to capture all of that move, but what we did capture helped us considerably. 
Our Hanceville OSB Alabama mill was down 42 days in Q1 for log outages, resulting from weather that was adverse to logging. Our TechShield Radiant Barrier OSB roof sheathing was up 50% over Q1 '09, and our TopNotch Sub-Flooring was up 24% from the same quarter last year. We did have two mills that we're indefinitely shut during the quarter, Chambord and Clark County. And the rest of our mills ran on various shifting schedules.
In Siding, our SmartSide volume was up about 20% over Q1 2009, with slightly stronger sales price due to mix, and we think that bodes well for us for the rest of the year. As Curt mentioned, our CanExel fine fiber product remains on allocation as we work to get our production scheduling back in balance. 
In Engineered Wood Products, the segment which is most heavily tied to new residential construction, we improved, which means we lost less money. At these volume levels, this is still a distressed business segment. Plaguing this business at present are the lack of starts and component raw material prices [audio gap] which are outstripping finished product pricing. 
As you know, I-Joist is made from OSB web stock and flanged lumber and LVL is made from peeled veneer. All three of these core components have increased substantially in price, more so than finished product pricing. 
In Chile, which I had an opportunity to visit in the first quarter, the earthquake affected our Lautaro mill adversely with about 17-day outage. But at present, both of our Chilean mills are running full, to feed the reconstruction efforts that is needed there. 
I'll spend a few moments looking forward in terms of what we see coming at us and then we'll open it up to questions. Obviously, the recent run-up in OSB pricing is going to positively affect the financial performance of our OSB business and LP overall in Q2. It has certainly been unexpected, but even at these demand and takeaway levels, it is very significant to us. But the housing market has experienced a welcome bump, if you will. However, from what I read, it is unlikely that substantial recovery towards the base underlying housing demand will be significant in 2010. I just reviewed a recent composite of the 2010 start forecast put together by APA, and that still doesn't break the 700,000 start level for 2010. Although RISI is still the outlier on this, having the end of the year start level at about 850,000. 
Couple of questions for us are yet unanswered. First, is how much of the current housing activity is a pull-forward cost by tax incentives. And the second is the channel building a little bit more of a position for the summer. Meanwhile, we are still looking at four large problems in the eyes of four that we have been looking at for a year now. The first is high unemployment, which last week came in at 9.9%; continued foreclosures; the excess of for-sale inventory of existing homes and in general, slower household formation. And because of these elements, we're still being quite cautious in our optimism around this recovery. 
That said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question period."

If you look at Q1, you guys get various amounts of information, but I'll refer to Random Lengths’ print. The year, North Central began on a 7/16 basis at 182. And I think quarter ended North Central 7/16 at 248. There are six different sales regions. And prices during the quarter varied between $10 and $15 up or down from each other in those sales regions. In the first quarter, the North Central was higher than all the other regions, except for Western Canada. So a weighted average of sales may not equal the North Central pricing that some people seem to pick and look at obsessively. There's also a lag on pricing for open market wood. The way this works is that as order files extend, an order taken in one week may not actually be delivered for four weeks. So in a climbing pricing environment, this creates a lag in terms of getting what may print on a Friday. It may take you however long your order file is out to capture that particular price. So if the market moves very, very quickly, you stay behind it. There's another influence that we had in terms of looking at that and that is that our value-added products tend to lag the market as well because the price in these products changes less rapidly. We did have a high component of value-added in Q1 with TechShield and TopNotch. And then finally, I think the other thing that influences price, particularly as price becomes higher, is that there are discounts on contracted wood on a percentage basis. So at a higher number those percentages are higher dollars. So that's what happens when the market moves very rapidly in the up direction."

So in terms of what that's done for us, if you remember, on the last call, I said we had just started Lautaro, which is our second mill up in hopes of running it for the rest of the year. We now feel quite confident that we will run both mills full out for a considerable period of time to help in that reconstruction. So we did start Lautaro up between Christmas and New Year's. Right after the earthquake, we added the fourth shift there as quickly as possible. So both Pangui and Lautaro are running full. The other positive thing out of this catastrophe was that wood construction held up quite well. So we think that it will continue to help us in our effort to convert building practices in Chile. We did send about 4 million feet down from Canada to Chile in the immediate relief effort. And with some help to our Brazilian operation, we're moving a couple thousand cubic meters a month over from Brazil. So Chile looks to be full speed ahead with both mills for the foreseeable future, meaning, I would think at least a couple of years. In Brazil, we are running our Ponta Grossa mill at about 50% of capacity. When we bought that mill, it was in need of some improvement. We do have one dryer and one thermal oil system, which is down. And we are looking to, perhaps, start that dryer and that thermal oil system up somewhere in the fourth quarter to continue to fill in the success that we're having in selling OSB for non-construction purposes in Brazil. In a concurrent effort, we are working through the bureaucratic red tape to qualify a building system in Brazil, what we're calling an OSB building system, which is if we’re successful there would allow us to then put LP OSB into that building system. There's a huge pent-up demand in Brazil, as I talked about last year and why we went there, currently, of about 7 million homes. And the need is projected for about 18 million homes over the next decade. So we think that that's going to continue to get more attractive for us. But right now, we're caught in this bureaucratic red tape. In Brazil, they don't approve single products. In their regulatory environment, they approve building systems. So we've been working on that now for about five or six months. And hopefully, we’ll break through sometime this year."

Rick will then take over, give you the weather report for Nashville and then discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our most recent operating results and his thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of 2010.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at our website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I'll be referencing these slides in my comments. We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we just filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter.
First thing on this slide is I'd like to remind all participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The Appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations, and those have been supplemented by the Form 8-K that we filed this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements but I am going to incorporate it with these references. 
Slide 4 of the presentation is a discussion of our Q1 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We're reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of nearly $300 million for the quarter. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $30 million or $0.29 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $206 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the first quarter of 2009. There was some movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 was 31%. It's primarily the result of the blended rate between jurisdictions with profits in foreign subsidiaries taxed at a lower rate than losses in North American operations. Q1 of 2009, the tax benefit rate was 39%, basically the statutory rate. Had the tax benefit rate in Q1 been the same as last year, net earnings per share would have been improved by about $0.03 a share.
Let me now discuss the performance of each of our segments. Slide 5 of the presentation is a summary of OSB. OSB had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to a $24 million operating loss in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, we had a 34% increase in volume at an average sales price that was 26% higher than the same quarter last year. This resulted in a $24 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increases our costs more than revenue due to sales being in the U.S., hurt our earnings in this segment by about $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a positive $4 million compared to a loss of $17 million in Q1 of last year.
Compared to Q4 of 2009, volumes were lower by 14% while pricing increased by 22%. Volumes in Q1 were constrained by the availability of logs in the U.S. South, due to extremely wet weather conditions that occurred during the quarter. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is our Siding segment, which includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $9 million, significantly better than the $2 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $14 million compared to $7 million in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 20% and unit volumes were better by 29% in SmartSide and down by about 15% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. Reductions in volumes for our CanExel product line was caused by our decision not to run one of the production lines while working on process improvements. This has limited our available product and customers are in allocation in CanExel.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up slightly due to product mix with individual product pricings remaining relatively flat. CanExel prices show a pretty significant increase at 24%, but this is largely due to this product being sold in Canada, and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased the U.S. equivalent sales price.
Slide 7 of the presentation, our Engineered Wood, which includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber produced at our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. The segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV are under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million, about half of what we recorded in Q1 of 2009 and Q4 of 2009.
Volumes of I-Joist were up significantly, 88%, while LVL/LSL were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase were tied to the increase in housing as well as during the quarter, we did see significant inventory building in the channel after dramatic reductions in 2009. Pricing was down slightly in I-Joist but up about 4% in LVL/LSL.
Our other building products, this category includes our interior moulding business, our South American operations and the U.S. GreenFiber joint venture and some non-operating facilities. Overall, we were slightly positive in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year. For the quarter, sales for these operations were $41 million, up 45% from the $28 million recorded in Q1 of last year. 
Some other items, we did have a small foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to a $2.6 million gain in the same quarter last year. And investment income in the quarter was about flat between periods, with returns down significantly but cash balances were higher. Interest expense was nearly $17 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in Q1 of 2009. This is primarily due to the higher cost refinancing that we completed late in Q1 of 2009. 
Slide 8 of the presentation shows some balance sheet items. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash were at $414 million at the end of the quarter, working capital about $520 million. We had net cash over debt of $136 million. And capital expenditures were a relatively modest $4 million in the quarter. Book value per ending share was $9.73.
I do want to mention, as I did in our earnings call at the end of, again, February that we did have a balance sheet gross-up that occurred in Q1 and was reflected retrospectively for prior periods. This was due to a change in an accounting standard. We added back our previously qualified special purpose entity, an entity called LP Plywood, that was off-balance sheet and now it's back on the balance sheet. This entity was put in place in 2003 to defer the income taxes paid on the sale of LP's southern timberlands. By adding this back, we increased our assets by $368 million, increased our liabilities by a like amount and reduced equity by about $1 million.
The overall transaction has been disclosed since the inception in our footnotes, but is now included in the balance sheet. Just as a note, the associated debt had little or no recourse to LP as it is backed by a letter of credit which is subsequently backed by cash. 
A few other comments before I give it to Rick, our federal tax refund, as we discussed in the last call, we did do a rapid filing of our 2009 federal income tax return and received a refund of about $47 million during the quarter. The balance sheet shows the remaining income tax receivable of about $6 million, and that will come back to LP over the next year or so. On the auction rate securities, based on valuations received from third parties, we did increase in the value of this portfolio by about $10 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are continuing to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. 
With that, let me it turn over to Rick."

It is drizzling here in Nashville, but we are drying out after a week of sunshine last week. I'm sure that you did see in the news that we had severe weather and a lot of rain in the middle Tennessee area last weekend. And we had flooding of I guess unprecedented nature. It was the worst flooding in history. I am happy to report and relieved to report that we were fortunate that no LP employees suffered significant flood damage, but the town will take some time to recover.
I want to begin my brief prepared remarks this morning by adding a little bit of color to Q1 but not be redundant to what Curt has already said. On the safety front, we got off to a great start in the year with only two recordable injuries across our system in Q1 and a TIR of 0.23. The other most significant event was that our Carthage OSB mill became the first OSB mill in history in North America to exceed 1 million incident-free work hours. 
Overall, financially, we did eke out our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter Q1 since 2006, which felt good. The housing market ended the quarter with seasonally adjusted single-family starts of about 530,000. Each of our three core businesses did improve financially from Q1 of '09, which was granted, a pretty low hurdle to jump over. But they also improved over Q4 of 2009 as well.
Make a few comments on each of our reporting segments for Q1. OSB did surprise us in Q1. Our customers' needs were more robust than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Random Lengths' print across the six different sales regions moved upward $60 to $65 on the 7/16-inch basis during the quarter. But because of the lag effect, which is the time between order and delivery, we weren't able to capture all of that move, but what we did capture helped us considerably. 
Our Hanceville OSB Alabama mill was down 42 days in Q1 for log outages, resulting from weather that was adverse to logging. Our TechShield Radiant Barrier OSB roof sheathing was up 50% over Q1 '09, and our TopNotch Sub-Flooring was up 24% from the same quarter last year. We did have two mills that were indefinitely shut during the quarter, Chambord and Clarke County. And the rest of our mills ran on various shifting schedules.
In Siding, our SmartSide volume was up about 20% over Q1 2009, with slightly stronger sales price due to mix, and we think that bodes well for us for the rest of the year. As Curt mentioned, our CanExel fine fiber product remains on allocation as we work to get our production scheduling back in balance. 
In Engineered Wood Products, the segment which is most heavily tied to new residential construction, we improved, which means we lost less money. At these volume levels, this is still a distressed business segment. Plaguing this business at the present are the lack of starts and component raw material prices [audio gap] which are outstripping finished product pricing. 
As you know, I-Joist is made from OSB web stock and flanged lumber and LVL is made from peeled veneer. All three of these core components have increased substantially in price, more so than finished product pricing. 
In Chile, which I had an opportunity to visit in the first quarter, the earthquake affected our Lautaro mill adversely with about a 17-day outage. But at present, both of our Chilean mills are running full to feed the reconstruction effort that is needed there. 
I'll spend a few moments looking forward in terms of what we see coming at us and then we'll open it up to questions. Obviously, the recent run-up in OSB pricing is going to positively affect the financial performance of our OSB business and LP overall in Q2. It has certainly been unexpected, but even at these demand and takeaway levels, it is very significant to us. But the housing market has experienced a welcome bump, if you will. However, from what I read, it is unlikely that a substantial recovery towards the base underlying housing demand will be significant in 2010. I just reviewed a recent composite of the 2010 start forecast put together by APA, and that still does not break the 700,000 start level for 2010, although RISI is still the outlier on this, having the end of the year start level at about 850,000. 
A couple of questions for us are yet unanswered. First, is how much of the current housing activity is a pull-forward caused by tax incentives. And the second, is the channel building a little bit more of a position for the summer. Meanwhile, we are still looking at four large problems in the eye, four that we have been looking at for a year now. The first is high unemployment, which last week came in at 9.9%; continued foreclosures; the excess for-sale inventory of existing homes; and in general, slower household formation. And because of these elements, we are still being quite cautious in our optimism around this recovery. 
That said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question period."

If you look at Q1, you guys get various amounts of information, but I'll refer to Random Lengths’ print. The year, North Central began on a 7/16 basis at 182. And I think quarter ended North Central 7/16 at 248. There are six different sales regions. And prices during the quarter varied between $10 and $15 up or down from each other in those sales regions. In the first quarter, the North Central was higher than all the other regions, except for Western Canada. So a weighted average of sales may not equal the North Central pricing that some people seem to pick and look at obsessively. There's also a lag on pricing for open market wood. The way this works is that as order files extend, an order taken in one week may not actually be delivered for four weeks. So in a climbing pricing environment, this creates a lag in terms of getting what may print on a Friday. It may take you however long your order file is out to capture that particular price. So if the market moves very, very quickly, you stay behind it. There's another influence that we had in terms of looking at that and that is that our value-added products tend to lag the market as well because the price in these products changes less rapidly. We did have a high component of value-added in Q1 with TechShield and TopNotch. And then finally, I think the other thing that influences price, particularly as price becomes higher, is that there are discounts on contracted wood on a percentage basis. So at a higher number those percentages are higher dollars. So that's what happens when the market moves very rapidly in the up direction."

I think in terms of Chile, from what we can tell, it looks like about 300,000 residences were destroyed in that earthquake, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years worth of building. So in terms of what that's done for us, if you remember, on the last call, I said we had just started Lautaro, which is our second mill up in hopes of running it for the rest of the year. We now feel quite confident that we will run both mills full out for a considerable period of time to help in that reconstruction. So we did start Lautaro up between Christmas and New Year's. Right after the earthquake, we added the fourth shift there as quickly as possible. So both Pangui and Lautaro are running full. The other positive thing out of this catastrophe was that wood construction held up quite well. So we think that it will continue to help us in our effort to convert building practices in Chile. We did send about 4 million feet down from Canada to Chile in the immediate relief effort. And with some help to our Brazilian operation, we're moving a couple thousand cubic meters a month over from Brazil. So Chile looks to be full speed ahead with both mills for the foreseeable future, meaning, I would think at least a couple of years. In Brazil, we are running our Ponta Grossa mill at about 50% of capacity. When we bought that mill, it was in need of some improvement. We do have one dryer and one thermal oil system, which is down. And we are looking to, perhaps, start that dryer and that thermal oil system up somewhere in the fourth quarter to continue to fill in the success that we're having in selling OSB for non-construction purposes in Brazil. In a concurrent effort, we are working through the bureaucratic red tape to qualify a building system in Brazil, what we're calling an OSB building system, which is if we’re successful there would allow us to then put LP OSB into that building system. There's a huge pent-up demand in Brazil, as I talked about last year and why we went there, currently, of about 7 million homes. And the need is projected for about 18 million homes over the next decade. So we think that that's going to continue to get more attractive for us. But right now, we're caught in this bureaucratic red tape. In Brazil, they don't approve single products. In their regulatory environment, they approve building systems. So we've been working on that now for about five or six months. And hopefully, we’ll break through sometime this year."

As the operator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO, as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2010, then I'll follow this with comments on some of our individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over, give you the weather report for Nashville and then discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our most recent operating results and his thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of 2010.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at our website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I'll be referencing these slides in my comments. We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we just filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter.
First thing on this slide is I'd like to remind all participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The Appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations, and those have been supplemented by the Form 8-K that we filed this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements but I am going to incorporate it with these references. 
Slide 4 of the presentation is a discussion of our Q1 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We're reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of nearly $300 million for the quarter. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $30 million or $0.29 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $206 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the first quarter of 2009. There was some movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 was 31%. It's primarily the result of the blended rate between jurisdictions with profits in foreign subsidiaries taxed at a lower rate than losses in North American operations. Q1 of 2009, the tax benefit rate was 39%, basically the statutory rate. Had the tax benefit rate in Q1 been the same as last year, net earnings per share would have been improved by about $0.03 a share.
Let me now discuss the performance of each of our segments. Slide 5 of the presentation is a summary of OSB. OSB had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to a $24 million operating loss in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, we had a 34% increase in volume at an average sales price that was 26% higher than the same quarter last year. This resulted in a $24 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increases our costs more than revenue due to sales being in the U.S., hurt our earnings in this segment by about $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a positive $4 million compared to a loss of $17 million in Q1 of last year.
Compared to Q4 of 2009, volumes were lower by 14% while pricing increased by 22%. Volumes in Q1 were constrained by the availability of logs in the U.S. South, due to extremely wet weather conditions that occurred during the quarter. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is our Siding segment, which includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $9 million, significantly better than the $2 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $14 million compared to $7 million in Q1 of 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 20% and unit volumes were better by 29% in SmartSide and down by about 15% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. Reductions in volumes for our CanExel product line was caused by our decision not to run one of the production lines while working on process improvements. This has limited our available product and customers are in allocation in CanExel.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up slightly due to product mix with individual product pricings remaining relatively flat. CanExel prices show a pretty significant increase at 24%, but this is largely due to this product being sold in Canada, and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased the U.S. equivalent sales price.
Slide 7 of the presentation, our Engineered Wood, which includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber produced at our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. The segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV are under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million, about half of what we recorded in Q1 of 2009 and Q4 of 2009.
Volumes of I-Joist were up significantly, 88%, while LVL/LSL were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase were tied to the increase in housing as well as during the quarter, we did see significant inventory building in the channel after dramatic reductions in 2009. Pricing was down slightly in I-Joist but up about 4% in LVL/LSL.
Our other building products, this category includes our interior moulding business, our South American operations and the U.S. GreenFiber joint venture and some non-operating facilities. Overall, we were slightly positive in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year. For the quarter, sales for these operations were $41 million, up 45% from the $28 million recorded in Q1 of last year. 
Some other items, we did have a small foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to a $2.6 million gain in the same quarter last year. And investment income in the quarter was about flat between periods, with returns down significantly but cash balances were higher. Interest expense was nearly $17 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in Q1 of 2009. This is primarily due to the higher cost refinancing that we completed late in Q1 of 2009. 
Slide 8 of the presentation shows some balance sheet items. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash were at $414 million at the end of the quarter, working capital about $520 million. We had net cash over debt of $136 million. And capital expenditures were a relatively modest $4 million in the quarter. Book value per ending share was $9.73.
I do want to mention, as I did in our earnings call at the end of, again, February that we did have a balance sheet gross-up that occurred in Q1 and was reflected retrospectively for prior periods. This was due to a change in an accounting standard. We added back our previously qualified special purpose entity, an entity called LP Plywood, that was off-balance sheet and now it's back on the balance sheet. This entity was put in place in 2003 to defer the income taxes paid on the sale of LP's southern timberlands. By adding this back, we increased our assets by $368 million, increased our liabilities by a like amount and reduced equity by about $1 million.
The overall transaction has been disclosed since the inception in our footnotes, but is now included in the balance sheet. Just as a note, the associated debt had little or no recourse to LP as it is backed by a letter of credit which is subsequently backed by cash. 
A few other comments before I give it to Rick, our federal tax refund, as we discussed in the last call, we did do a rapid filing of our 2009 federal income tax return and received a refund of about $47 million during the quarter. The balance sheet shows the remaining income tax receivable of about $6 million, and that will come back to LP over the next year or so. On the auction rate securities, based on valuations received from third parties, we did increase in the value of this portfolio by about $10 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are continuing to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. 
With that, let me it turn over to Rick."

It is drizzling here in Nashville, but we are drying out after a week of sunshine last week. I'm sure that you did see in the news that we had severe weather and a lot of rain in the middle Tennessee area last weekend. And we had flooding of I guess unprecedented nature. It was the worst flooding in history. I am happy to report and relieved to report that we were fortunate that no LP employees suffered significant flood damage, but the town will take some time to recover.
I want to begin my brief prepared remarks this morning by adding a little bit of color to Q1 but not be redundant to what Curt has already said. On the safety front, we got off to a great start in the year with only two recordable injuries across our system in Q1 and a TIR of 0.23. The other most significant event was that our Carthage OSB mill became the first OSB mill in history in North America to exceed one million incident-free work hours. 
Overall, financially, we did eke out our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter -- Q1 since 2006, which felt good. The housing market ended the quarter with seasonally adjusted single-family starts of about 530,000. Each of our three core businesses did improve financially from Q1 of '09, which was, granted, a pretty low hurdle to jump over. But they also improved over Q4 of 2009 as well.
Make a few comments on each of our reporting segments for Q1. OSB did surprise us in Q1. Our customers' needs were more robust than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Random Lengths' print across the six different sales regions moved upward $60 to $65 on the 7/16-inch basis during the quarter. But because of the lag effect, which is the time between order and delivery, we weren't able to capture all of that move, but what we did capture helped us considerably. 
Our Hanceville OSB Alabama mill was down 42 days in Q1 for log outages, resulting from weather that was adverse to logging. Our TechShield Radiant Barrier OSB roof sheathing was up 50% over Q1 '09, and our TopNotch Sub-Flooring was up 24% from the same quarter last year. We did have two mills that were indefinitely shut during the quarter, Chambord and Clarke County. And the rest of our mills ran on various shifting schedules.
In Siding, our SmartSide volume was up about 20% over Q1 2009, with slightly stronger sales price due to mix, and we think that bodes well for us for the rest of the year. As Curt mentioned, our CanExel fine fiber product remains on allocation as we work to get our production scheduling back in balance. 
In Engineered Wood Products, the segment which is most heavily tied to new residential construction, we improved, which means we lost less money. At these volume levels, this is still a distressed business segment. Plaguing this business at the present are the lack of starts and component raw material prices [audio gap] which are outstripping finished product pricing. 
As you know, I-Joist is made from OSB web stock and flanged lumber and LVL is made from peeled veneer. All three of these core components have increased substantially in price, more so than finished product pricing. 
In Chile, which I had an opportunity to visit in the first quarter, the earthquake affected our Lautaro mill adversely with about a 17-day outage. But at present, both of our Chilean mills are running full to feed the reconstruction effort that is needed there. 
I'll spend a few moments looking forward in terms of what we see coming at us and then we'll open it up to questions. Obviously, the recent run-up in OSB pricing is going to positively affect the financial performance of our OSB business and LP overall in Q2. It has certainly been unexpected, but even at these demand and takeaway levels, it is very significant to us. But the housing market has experienced a welcome bump, if you will. However, from what I read, it is unlikely that a substantial recovery towards the base underlying housing demand will be significant in 2010. I just reviewed a recent composite of the 2010 start forecast put together by APA, and that still does not break the 700,000 start level for 2010, although RISI is still the outlier on this, having the end of the year start level at about 850,000. 
A couple of questions for us are yet unanswered. First, is how much of the current housing activity is a pull-forward caused by tax incentives? And the second, is the channel building a little bit more of a position for the summer? Meanwhile, we are still looking at four large problems in the eye, the four that we have been looking at for a year now. The first is high unemployment, which last week came in at 9.9%; continued foreclosures; the excess for-sale inventory of existing homes; and in general, slower household formation. And because of these elements, we are still being quite cautious in our optimism around this recovery. 
That said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question period."

We were only able to meet that demand as we had put production on. And when demand's a little bit higher than the ability to supply it, on a traded commodity it moves it forward. And so I think one of the analysts wrote about a demand-less recovery, it wasn't huge. It wasn't demand that we felt back several years ago, but it was a little bit more than we could supply.

If you look at Q1, you guys get various amounts of information, but I'll refer to Random Lengths’ print. The year, North Central began on a 7/16 basis at 182. And I think quarter ended North Central 7/16 at 248. There are six different sales regions. And prices during the quarter varied between $10 and $15 up or down from each other in those sales regions. In the first quarter, the North Central was higher than all the other regions, except for Western Canada. So a weighted average of sales may not equal the North Central pricing that some people seem to pick and look at obsessively. There's also a lag on pricing for open market wood. The way this works is that as order files extend, an order taken in one week may not actually be delivered for four weeks. So in a climbing pricing environment, this creates a lag in terms of getting what may print on a Friday. It may take you however long your order file is out to capture that particular price. So if the market moves very, very quickly, you stay behind it. There's another influence that we had in terms of looking at that and that is that our value-added products tend to lag the market as well because the price in these products changes less rapidly. We did have a high component of value-added in Q1 with TechShield and TopNotch. And then finally, I think the other thing that influences price, particularly as price becomes higher, is that there are discounts on contracted wood on a percentage basis. So at a higher number those percentages are higher dollars. So that's what happens when the market moves very rapidly in the up direction."

I think in terms of Chile, from what we can tell, it looks like about 300,000 residences were destroyed in that earthquake, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years worth of building. So in terms of what that's done for us, if you remember, on the last call, I said we had just started Lautaro, which is our second mill up in hopes of running it for the rest of the year. We now feel quite confident that we will run both mills full out for a considerable period of time to help in that reconstruction. So we did start Lautaro up between Christmas and New Year's. Right after the earthquake, we added the fourth shift there as quickly as possible. So both Pangui and Lautaro are running full. The other positive thing out of this catastrophe was that wood construction held up quite well. So we think that it will continue to help us in our effort to convert building practices in Chile. We did send about 4 million feet down from Canada to Chile in the immediate relief effort. And with some help to our Brazilian operation, we're moving a couple thousand cubic meters a month over from Brazil. So Chile looks to be full speed ahead with both mills for the foreseeable future, meaning, I would think at least a couple of years. In Brazil, we are running our Ponta Grossa mill at about 50% of capacity. When we bought that mill, it was in need of some improvement. We do have one dryer and one thermal oil system, which is down. And we are looking to, perhaps, start that dryer and that thermal oil system up somewhere in the fourth quarter to continue to fill in the success that we're having in selling OSB for non-construction purposes in Brazil. In a concurrent effort, we are working through the bureaucratic red tape to qualify a building system in Brazil, what we're calling an OSB building system, which is if we’re successful there would allow us to then put LP OSB into that building system. There's a huge pent-up demand in Brazil, as I talked about last year and why we went there, currently, of about 7 million homes. And the need is projected for about 18 million homes over the next decade. So we think that that's going to continue to get more attractive for us. But right now, we're caught in this bureaucratic red tape. In Brazil, they don't approve single products. In their regulatory environment, they approve building systems. So we've been working on that now for about five or six months. And hopefully, we’ll break through sometime this year."

And with me today, Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, who are primary Investor Relations contacts. 
As I usually do, I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter. I'll follow that with some comments on the performance of our individual segments and talk a bit about the balance sheet.
While I'd like to spend a lot of time talking about Q2 because it was such a good quarter for us, I suspect that what many of you are wondering about is where the market will go next. To that end, after I finish my comments, I'll turn you over to Rick Frost, who will give you his weather update for Nashville, discuss the general market environment, in which we're operating, and his perspective on both the most recent quarter and his thoughts for the rest of this year. As we've done in the past, we have opened up the call to the public and are doing a webcast, can be accessed at our webcast, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation. It has supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction to the earnings release, and I will be referencing that document as I go through my comments.
This morning, we did file an 8-K that had supplemental information, and we intend to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements, comment that is included on Slide 2 of this presentation. Also be aware on Slide 3 that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information, and the necessary appendix for this is in the back of the presentation, as well as in the supplemental material that we filed with the Form 8-K this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Direct your attention to Slide 4 of the presentation for our discussion of the overall Q2 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Today, we're reporting net income for the second quarter of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $447 million for the quarter, that's an increase of nearly 2/3 compared to the second quarter of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported net loss of $29 million or $0.28 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $267 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $75 million in the quarter compared to have a loss of $11 million in Q2 of 2009. Very small movement in the tax rate between the two quarters. Q2 2010 was 35% and last year, the same quarter, it was 37%. 
On the earnings per share calculation, I would have you note that the basic average shares outstanding used in Q2 of 2010 is 25% higher than the same quarter last year, and the diluted average shares outstanding is 36% higher. This reflects the issuance of the shares in September 2009, when we did the clawback equity offering and the warrants that we're attached to the 2017 subordinated notes. In addition, as this was a profitable quarter, it takes into consideration the in-the-money invested options and Stock Settled Stock Appreciation Rights.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of our year-to-date results compared to last year. For the year, we're reporting basically breakeven. Net sales from continuing operations were $744 million, 57% higher than the first half of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss on sales of $473 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months is $78 million this year compared to a loss of $36 million the prior year. The tax rate at continuing operations looks a little funny here. As the company is close to breakeven, the discreet tax items had a much more meaningful impact on the rate. So while it looks odd, that 69% is based on very low or very near breakeven performance. 
Let me now talk about each one of our segments. Slide 6 is an overview of our OSB segment. OSB had operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the same quarter last year. For the quarter, sales increased by more than double on a 24% increase in volume, at an average sales price of a 78% higher than the same quarter last year. Obviously, the increase in sales price created most of the improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. We believe the increase in OSB price is due to several factors. We continue to have some raw material shortages primarily logs, caused by weather in the U.S. South, create the incremental real demand due to higher building activity. We saw a desire of our customers to restock their severely-depleted inventories in anticipation of a housing recovery. 
On the other side, as quickly as the pricing ran up at the end of the first quarter into the middle of the second, it has dropped back down and North Central 7/16 is currently below $200 per thousand. Offsetting the positive impact of price and volume is we did have a strengthening at Canadian dollar, which increased our cost in Canada. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was $58 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q2 of last year. We just look back to Q1, volumes were higher by 1/3 and prices increased by about that same amount, 36%.
Year-to-date, OSB had an operating income of $43 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million for the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $62 million this year compared to a loss of $26 million. Pricing accounted for most of that improvement, although we did have higher volumes as well. 
Slide 7 is our Siding segment. Just to remind you, this includes SmartSide, our CanExel Siding product in Canada and commodity always being produced at our Hayward mill. For the second quarter, Siding had operating income of $22 million, significantly better than the $7 million recorded in same quarter last year. A piece of this improvement was related to the OSB sold in this segment, about 50 million square feet in both Q2 of 2010, 2009, which contributed $4 million worth of earnings this quarter and the same quarter last year, about a $2 million loss, so $6 million of that swing is attributable to the improvement in OSB.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of Siding segment was $27 million compared to $11 million in Q2 of '09. For the quarter, sales were up 25%, with unit volumes being better by 19% in SmartSide and down slightly in CanExel. The reduction in our CanExel product line was caused by our decision to halt production on our 16-foot line, as well as a discontinuance of our Door Skin business. For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices up 2%. This is largely due to mix. And CanExel prices showed a pretty significant increase, but that is related principally to the Canadian dollar, the strength of the Canadian dollar, as well as the exit of our lower-priced product line being Door Skin. 
On a year-to-date basis, Siding had operating income of $30 million compared to $9 million, same last year, with adjusted EBITDA being $41 million this year and $18 million in 2009. As I mentioned in my earlier discussion, most of this improvement is from Siding volume and the earnings turnaround in OSB, it's in California's sector.
Engineered Wood in Slide 8 of the presentation. This includes our I-Joist, our Laminated Strand Lumber are produced in our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus related products. It also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our Abitibi JV and LVL products that are produced under our arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of less than a cap of what they did last year, $4 million versus $9 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of just under $1 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $6 million in Q2 of last year. Volumes were up significantly. I-Joist up 29%, and LVL/LSL shipments up 46% compared to the same quarter. Pricing was up 7% in both I-Joist and LVL. That was due to a price increase that we put in several months ago that partially offsets the higher raw material cost that we saw in OSB, veneer and lumber. On a year-to-date basis, the operating loss for EWP was $11 million compared to loss of $18 million in the same period, while EBITDA was, for a couple of periods, was $4 million in 2010 versus a loss of $12 million in 2009.
Our Other Building Products, there's no slide for this, but let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing income about $4 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to income of about $1 million in the second quarter of 2009. Most of that improvement is related to our South American operations. For the quarter, sales were up 59% at $48 million compared to $30 million in Q2 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, about $4 million of net income compared to  $2.2 million in the same period last year, with an increase in sales of 15%, getting us to $89 million for the first six months of this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $9.2 million in 2010 and $7 million in 2009. Some other things, we had a very small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about a $7 million gains in the same quarter last year. The primary reason for this is at the end of 2009, we did refinance our Chilean term loan, that was in U.S. dollars, and the replacement loan is denominated in Chilean pesos, so we shouldn't have a wide swings in our accounting results related to foreign currency gain and losses attributable to that loan. Investment income in the quarter was lower than Q2 of 2009. Returns are down significantly with the low interest rate environment that we're in. Interest expense was about $18 million compared to $22 million in Q2 of 2009. This is primarily due to the fallback that we did on the subordinated notes last of October. On the selling, general, administrative costs, they were flat between years to $29 million, and for the unallocated, the corporate piece of that, that was also flat at about $18 million in the quarter. 
Slide 8 of the presentation, there are some key balance sheet statistics. Our cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was $487 million at the end of June, working capital nearly $600 million, net cash of $210 million over the debt, and there is an appendix in the presentation that provides that calculation. Capital expenditures were very low in the quarter, $5 million. So we are in target to be less than $25 million, which is the guidance that we have been providing. Book value per earning share was at $9.55. 
One last thing I would want to note before I turn it over to Rick is that we did receive the $115 million payment on the timber notes, and we turned around and repaid $113 million a limited recourse to debt at the end of the quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

True to form, we are having quite a warm and muggy summer in Nashville this year, about 95 out there today. I guess in the name of full disclosure at the end of business today, I'm headed for the coast of Maine for some vacation and to catch up with my wife. So really, the call is today, rather than next Tuesday so that I can have the weekend to do that. So thank you for checking in on a Friday afternoon.
I will follow convention in my prepared remarks this afternoon to discuss Q2 results. I want to make some observations about the quarter and then give you a sense of how Q3 feels to us right now. 
I'll begin with our core value of workplace safety. We had another excellent quarter operating safely. All of our businesses year-to-date are operating with a TIR of less than 1. And as a Corporation, we are 0.44 at this time through June. 2/3 of our plants remained injury-free through the first half of this year compared to about half of the plants at this time last year. And we did hit a number of significant milestones during the quarter at various plants. To name two, our Panguipulli mill in Chile set a new company best at over 1.25 million recordable free work hours, and our Wilmington LVL plant reached three years without a recordable incident. The regulatory environment proposes us uncertainty, as we are waiting for the EPA to write its weather map targets, in which we expect will be done in the first quarter of 2011. And we are still wondering about what new CO2 regulations might surface. I'm only mentioning that because we do not have a clear impact, a view of these impacts at this time, but it is on the radar screen.
In our Lean Six Sigma Program, in its third full year of implementation, continues to deliver for us about 5.7:1 as a return rate this year to date. As Curt mentioned, our financial performance in Q2 was a great breath of fresh air for us. Business activity was quite brisk during the first two months of the second quarter, followed then but what I would characterize as a relatively dead year. As Curt explained, the Q2 '10, the Q2 '09 comparisons are good. They are good story. They show our financial leverage, in my opinion, that we have with just a little bit of additional demand. 
OSB was the biggest story with the first five weeks of the quarter experiencing rapidly rising prices, as demand spiked unexpectedly on an end-channel inventory. That was followed by the next five weeks of rapidly falling prices and the month of June was relatively flat. Our sales volume was up about 24% Q2 to Q2, and the pricing story was significant. 
Our effective production capacity ratio, which I have defined as what we've produced divided by the mills that we currently have running, was 86% for the quarter. If we include our indefinitely-shuttered mills capacity in that denominator, that dropped to 66%. In Q1 of 2010, those numbers were 68% and 52%, respectively. 
I had the opportunity in the last couple of months to speak to several analyst conferences during -- at which time, I was asked the question around the high volatility around OSB pricing. We entered the quarter at North Central 7/16 sprint of about 220 had ascended to a high, I think, of about 395, and then we actually ended the quarter down at $200 per MSF. Now the analogy that might help in understanding this volatility is for me to imagine a truck with the suspension on the shocks removed, and that was the supply chain as we went into the beginning of the quarter. There were just no buffers to absorb any bumps. And so when the bumps occurred, there were metal-on-metal, so to speak. 
We had a demand increase. We think that was associated with the efforts to come in under the tax credit deadline. Pressure mounted for takeaways. The channel had very little inventory. And we had little inventory and little ability to add production, so there was a hard bounce up. And of course, then we had a hard down reaction towards the quarter. 
As one of my people said it this way not too long ago, they said in March and April, we could hardly keep up with the consumer and the builder. In May, the builder was finishing up and they quit placing more orders. And in June, the consumer and the builders basically shut down. Our order files have shortened and then we started to readjust our output to the lower demands. Our experience was that business did noticeably slow down on Memorial Day weekend, both from a distribution standpoint and a retail standpoint. 
I'll move now to a short discussion of our Siding Products segment. Siding did have an excellent quarter. Our profits were up from $6.5 million in Q2 of last year to $21.8 million in Q2 of this year. And as Curt pointed out, $4 million of that was from OSB pricing from the other fee volume that we manufacture at our Hayward plant. The volumes at Hayward Q2-to-Q2 were about the same. 
Our SmartSide volume was up Q2-to-Q2 by 20%. We continued to gain traction in Siding in both the retail sector and the distribution sector, as the builder and homeowner delight with this product continues to increase. 
A rolling fourth quarter volume for North American housing to start year-over-year change in the Siding is up 33%. And this numbers excludes retail and our Sheath business. In Engineered Wood Products, the uptick in volumes in Q2 of this year over last year, along with implementing the general sales price increase did allow us to pay our losses considerably about 47% Q2-to-Q2. Our major bleeder in this business remains our LSL Products segment, as we only run that mill at about 14% of its capacity in this difficult market. Engineered Wood, as you know, is the most highly tied segment to new housing starts. But we are making some inroads with our West Coast LVL in Australia and with our LSL product in Europe.
From a market penetration perspective, we did capture almost 500 market wins in Q2. As you may remember, I define a market win as an additional product placement with an existing customer or a product placement with a new customer. Over 100 of these were in our SmartSide term product line and 60 were with our LSL product. TechShield, our radiant barrier roof sheathing, does continue to grow and is actually up in volume 40% in the per-start calculation year-over-year. Another slice on all of these that's important to me is that we had 132 dealer wins in those 500 wins in Q2. And the dealer win is a large part of our current focus. The dealer is critical to connect the supply chain between our efforts to partner with the distributor and do pull-through selling to the builder.
I'll finish my discussion with Q2 with a few comments on South America. We are off to our best year ever in Chile, our highest volumes and our highest profits. Both Chilean OSB mills are running full out as a result of the February earthquake. We have also spiked some of their short-term needs with volume from Brazil. Most of the spike in demand in Chile so far has just been related to the short-term, temporary needs from the catastrophe and not related yet to the longer-term rebuilding efforts that need to occur. And we are heartened to see that the frame built construction in Chile did fare far better under the earthquake conditions. So we think that will continue to aid our efforts at converting building prices in Chile. Brazil was also profitable for Q2 with the mill running at about 60% of its rated capacity. Very little of this product is going into housing yet. We are finding alternative uses for that, but we did achieve our APA panel stamp for our Brazilian products. 
So I'll finish my prepared remark with a few comments about the near future. The current demand environment, I would describe it is, it has gone very flat. For us, it was an abrupt shift in the first week in June. In response to this, we will be taking the necessary downtime across all of our products product lines to work down our finished good inventories to more closely match production with what we are currently experiencing for demand. 
Today, Q3, in terms of demand, feels a lot like Q3 of 2009. To us, it feels like demand was pulled forward into Q2 from Q3 and Q4. So in the short-term, the fundamentals that we all talk about that are dampening the demand for new home construction are still at play. High-end employment, we have 4.5% of the workforce that's unemployed and has been unemployed for over six months. Currently, we have low consumer confidence as we continued foreclosure in overhang issue. And we do have a slowing of household formation under these conditions. The current lack of housing demand, job growth and credit availability has created, I would call, a feeling of caution at all levels in our supply chain.
While I think we look at 2010 as overall better than 2009, I do expect the second half of 2010 to be quiet from what we are experiencing right now. Noticeable improvement may be delayed probably until 2011. So those are my comments. Curt?"

And so if you look at where the Canadian dollar was in 2009 Q2 versus 2010, I think, it was about $0.03 in difference. So that would be roughly $1 million, $1.2 million out of that. Probably the bigger difference, if we look at Q2 '09 to Q2 '10 on the raw material side, we had about, across the corporation, about a $9 million increase in our costs. About $1.5 million of that was in the logs and the rest was in resins and waxes associated with the higher cost of the oil-based raw materials. So fundamentally, it's in those areas, in the Canadian dollar and the high raw materials cost."

The first bucket is that not everything's is holding North Central. So if you look at it, you actually, will have at any given time, I think, today, you probably have between the Mid-Atlantic and North Central. There's probably a $15 per 1000 [square feet] price differential today. If you look during the quarter, we started the quarter with very little pricing on the West. It went up pretty significantly, but then it fell further. So any volume that would have gone to the West. So the adjust for that is probably about 1/3 of the difference that you just said is related to what regions we sell our product in and what the Random Lengths was in that area. The other thing, the second bucket is there are functional discounts for big purchasers. The latter the piece of it is as the price goes up, from a dollar standpoint, that goes up as the functional discounts are as a percentage. The third bucket for us is that we do sell our specialty products on a different way than daily trading. We generally provide a monthly pricing. So for our TechShield product, for our top-notch flooring products, we provide a pricing, a flat pricing during a particular month and then adjust that. And so when you're having a rapidly rising market, you don't capture all that. When you have a falling market, then we buy anything. And so you don't give the advantage of it going down.

And with me today, Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, who are primary Investor Relations contacts. 
As I usually do, I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter. I'll follow that with some comments on the performance of our individual segments and talk a bit about the balance sheet.
While I'd like to spend a lot of time talking about Q2 because it was such a good quarter for us, I suspect that what many of you are wondering about is where the market will go next. To that end, after I finish my comments, I'll turn you over to Rick Frost, who will give you his weather update for Nashville, discuss the general market environment, in which we're operating, and his perspective on both the most recent quarter and his thoughts for the rest of this year. As we've done in the past, we have opened up the call to the public and are doing a webcast, can be accessed at our webcast, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation. It has supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction to the earnings release, and I will be referencing that document as I go through my comments.
This morning, we did file an 8-K that had supplemental information, and we intend to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements, comment that is included on Slide 2 of this presentation. Also be aware on Slide 3 that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information, and the necessary appendix for this is in the back of the presentation, as well as in the supplemental material that we filed with the Form 8-K this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Direct your attention to Slide 4 of the presentation for our discussion of the overall Q2 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Today, we're reporting net income for the second quarter of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $447 million for the quarter, that's an increase of nearly 2/3 compared to the second quarter of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported net loss of $29 million or $0.28 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $267 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $75 million in the quarter compared to have a loss of $11 million in Q2 of 2009. Very small movement in the tax rate between the two quarters. Q2 2010 was 35% and last year, the same quarter, it was 37%. 
On the earnings per share calculation, I would have you note that the basic average shares outstanding used in Q2 of 2010 is 25% higher than the same quarter last year, and the diluted average shares outstanding is 36% higher. This reflects the issuance of the shares in September 2009, when we did the clawback equity offering and the warrants that we're attached to the 2017 subordinated notes. In addition, as this was a profitable quarter, it takes into consideration the in-the-money invested options and Stock Settled Stock Appreciation Rights.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of our year-to-date results compared to last year. For the year, we're reporting basically breakeven. Net sales from continuing operations were $744 million, 57% higher than the first half of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss on sales of $473 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months is $78 million this year compared to a loss of $36 million the prior year. The tax rate at continuing operations looks a little funny here. As the company is close to breakeven, the discreet tax items had a much more meaningful impact on the rate. So while it looks odd, that 69% is based on very low or very near breakeven performance. 
Let me now talk about each one of our segments. Slide 6 is an overview of our OSB segment. OSB had operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the same quarter last year. For the quarter, sales increased by more than double on a 24% increase in volume, at an average sales price of a 78% higher than the same quarter last year. Obviously, the increase in sales price created most of the improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. We believe the increase in OSB price is due to several factors. We continue to have some raw material shortages primarily logs, caused by weather in the U.S. South, create the incremental real demand due to higher building activity. We saw a desire of our customers to restock their severely-depleted inventories in anticipation of a housing recovery. 
On the other side, as quickly as the pricing ran up at the end of the first quarter into the middle of the second, it has dropped back down and North Central 7/16 is currently below $200 per thousand. Offsetting the positive impact of price and volume is we did have a strengthening at Canadian dollar, which increased our cost in Canada. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was $58 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q2 of last year. We just look back to Q1, volumes were higher by 1/3 and prices increased by about that same amount, 36%.
Year-to-date, OSB had an operating income of $43 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million for the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $62 million this year compared to a loss of $26 million. Pricing accounted for most of that improvement, although we did have higher volumes as well. 
Slide 7 is our Siding segment. Just to remind you, this includes SmartSide, our CanExel Siding product in Canada and commodity always being produced at our Hayward mill. For the second quarter, Siding had operating income of $22 million, significantly better than the $7 million recorded in same quarter last year. A piece of this improvement was related to the OSB sold in this segment, about 50 million square feet in both Q2 of 2010, 2009, which contributed $4 million worth of earnings this quarter and the same quarter last year, about a $2 million loss, so $6 million of that swing is attributable to the improvement in OSB.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of Siding segment was $27 million compared to $11 million in Q2 of '09. For the quarter, sales were up 25%, with unit volumes being better by 19% in SmartSide and down slightly in CanExel. The reduction in our CanExel product line was caused by our decision to halt production on our 16-foot line, as well as a discontinuance of our Door Skin business. For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices up 2%. This is largely due to mix. And CanExel prices showed a pretty significant increase, but that is related principally to the Canadian dollar, the strength of the Canadian dollar, as well as the exit of our lower-priced product line being Door Skin. 
On a year-to-date basis, Siding had operating income of $30 million compared to $9 million, same last year, with adjusted EBITDA being $41 million this year and $18 million in 2009. As I mentioned in my earlier discussion, most of this improvement is from Siding volume and the earnings turnaround in OSB, it's in California's sector.
Engineered Wood in Slide 8 of the presentation. This includes our I-Joist, our Laminated Strand Lumber are produced in our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus related products. It also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our Abitibi JV and LVL products that are produced under our arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of less than a cap of what they did last year, $4 million versus $9 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of just under $1 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $6 million in Q2 of last year. Volumes were up significantly. I-Joist up 29%, and LVL/LSL shipments up 46% compared to the same quarter. Pricing was up 7% in both I-Joist and LVL. That was due to a price increase that we put in several months ago that partially offsets the higher raw material cost that we saw in OSB, veneer and lumber. On a year-to-date basis, the operating loss for EWP was $11 million compared to loss of $18 million in the same period, while EBITDA was, for a couple of periods, was $4 million in 2010 versus a loss of $12 million in 2009.
Our Other Building Products, there's no slide for this, but let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing income about $4 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to income of about $1 million in the second quarter of 2009. Most of that improvement is related to our South American operations. For the quarter, sales were up 59% at $48 million compared to $30 million in Q2 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, about $4 million of net income compared to  $2.2 million in the same period last year, with an increase in sales of 15%, getting us to $89 million for the first six months of this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $9.2 million in 2010 and $7 million in 2009. Some other things, we had a very small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about a $7 million gains in the same quarter last year. The primary reason for this is at the end of 2009, we did refinance our Chilean term loan, that was in U.S. dollars, and the replacement loan is denominated in Chilean pesos, so we shouldn't have a wide swings in our accounting results related to foreign currency gain and losses attributable to that loan. Investment income in the quarter was lower than Q2 of 2009. Returns are down significantly with the low interest rate environment that we're in. Interest expense was about $18 million compared to $22 million in Q2 of 2009. This is primarily due to the fallback that we did on the subordinated notes last of October. On the selling, general, administrative costs, they were flat between years to $29 million, and for the unallocated, the corporate piece of that, that was also flat at about $18 million in the quarter. 
Slide 8 of the presentation, there are some key balance sheet statistics. Our cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was $487 million at the end of June, working capital nearly $600 million, net cash of $210 million over the debt, and there is an appendix in the presentation that provides that calculation. Capital expenditures were very low in the quarter, $5 million. So we are in target to be less than $25 million, which is the guidance that we have been providing. Book value per earning share was at $9.55. 
One last thing I would want to note before I turn it over to Rick is that we did receive the $115 million payment on the timber notes, and we turned around and repaid $113 million a limited recourse to debt at the end of the quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

I will follow convention in my prepared remarks this afternoon to discuss Q2 results. I want to make some observations about the quarter and then give you a sense of how Q3 feels to us right now. 
I'll begin with our core value of workplace safety. We had another excellent quarter operating safely. All of our businesses year-to-date are operating with a TIR of less than 1. And as a Corporation, we are 0.44 at this time through June. 2/3 of our plants remained injury-free through the first half of this year compared to about half of the plants at this time last year. And we did hit a number of significant milestones during the quarter at various plants. To name two, our Panguipulli mill in Chile set a new company best at over 1.25 million recordable free work hours, and our Wilmington LVL plant reached three years without a recordable incident. The regulatory environment proposes us uncertainty, as we are waiting for the EPA to write its weather map targets, in which we expect will be done in the first quarter of 2011. And we are still wondering about what new CO2 regulations might surface. I'm only mentioning that because we do not have a clear impact, a view of these impacts at this time, but it is on the radar screen.
And our Lean Six Sigma Program, in its third full year of implementation, continues to deliver for us about 5.7:1 as a return rate this year to date. As Curt mentioned, our financial performance in Q2 was a great breath of fresh air for us. Business activity was quite brisk during the first two months of the second quarter, followed then by what I would characterize as a relatively dead due. As Curt explained, the Q2 '10, the Q2 '09 comparisons are good. They're a good story. They showed a financial leverage, in my opinion, that we have with just a little bit of additional demand. 
OSB was the biggest story with the first five weeks of the quarter experiencing rapidly rising prices, as demand spiked unexpectedly on an end-channel inventory. That was followed by the next five weeks of rapidly falling prices and the month of June was relatively flat. Our sales volume was up about 24% Q2 to Q2, and the pricing story was significant. 
Our effective production capacity ratio, which I have defined as what we've produced divided by the mills that we currently have running, was 86% for the quarter. If we include our indefinitely-shuttered mills capacity in that denominator, that dropped to 66%. In Q1 of 2010, those numbers were 68% and 52%, respectively. 
I had the opportunity in the last couple of months to speak to several analyst conferences during -- at which time, I was asked the question around the high volatility around OSB pricing. We entered the quarter at North Central 7/16 sprint of about 220 had ascended to a high, I think, of about 395, and then we actually ended the quarter down at $200 per MSF. Now the analogy that might help in understanding this volatility is for me to imagine a truck with the suspension on the shocks removed, and that was the supply chain as we went into the beginning of the quarter. There were just no buffers to absorb any bumps. And so when the bumps occurred, they were metal-on-metal, so to speak. 
We had a demand increase. We think that was associated with the efforts to come in under the tax credit deadline. Pressure mounted for takeaways. The channel had very little inventory. And we had little inventory and little ability to add production, so there was a hard bounce up. And of course, then we had a hard down reaction towards the quarter. 
As one of my people said it this way not too long ago, they said in March and April, we could hardly keep up with the consumer and the builder. In May, the builder was finishing up and they quit placing more orders. And in June, the consumer and the builders basically shut down. Our order files have shortened and then we started to readjust our output to the lower demands. Our experience was that business did noticeably slow down on Memorial Day weekend, both from a distribution standpoint and a retail standpoint. 
I'll move now to a short discussion of our Siding Products segment. Siding did have an excellent quarter. Our profits were up from $6.5 million in Q2 of last year to $21.8 million in Q2 of this year. And as Curt pointed out, $4 million of that was from OSB pricing from the OSB volume that we manufacture at our Hayward plant. The volumes at Hayward Q2-to-Q2 were about the same. 
Our SmartSide volume was up Q2-to-Q2 by 20%. We continued to gain traction in Siding in both the retail sector and the distribution sector, as the builder and homeowner delight with this product continues to increase. 
A rolling fourth quarter volume for North American housing start year-over-year change in the Siding is up 33%. And this numbers excludes retail and our Sheath business. In Engineered Wood Products, the uptick in volumes in Q2 of this year over last year, along with implementing the general sales price increase did allow us to pay our losses considerably about 47% Q2-to-Q2. Our major bleeder in this business remains our LSL Products segment, as we only run that mill at about 14% of its capacity in this difficult market. Engineered Wood, as you know, is the most highly tied segment to new housing starts. But we are making some inroads with our West Coast LVL in Australia and with our LSL product in Europe.
From a market penetration perspective, we did capture almost 500 market wins in Q2. As you may remember, I define a market win as an additional product placement with an existing customer or a product placement with a new customer. Over 100 of these were in our SmartSide Trim product line and 60 were with our LSL product. TechShield, our radiant barrier roof sheathing, does continue to grow and is actually up in volume 40% in a per-start calculation year-over-year. Another slice on all of these that's important to me is that we had 132 dealer wins in those 500 wins in Q2. And the dealer win is a large part of our current focus. The dealer is critical to connect the supply chain between our efforts to partner with the distributor and do pull-through selling to the builder.
I'll finish my discussion with Q2 with a few comments on South America. We are off to our best year ever in Chile, our highest volumes and our highest profits. Both Chilean OSB mills are running full out as a result of the February earthquake. We have also spiked some of their short-term needs with volume from Brazil. Most of the spike in demand in Chile so far has just been related to the short-term, temporary needs from the catastrophe and not related yet to the longer-term rebuilding efforts that need to occur. And we are heartened to see that the frame built construction in Chile did fare far better under the earthquake conditions. So we think that will continue to aid our efforts at converting building prices in Chile. Brazil was also profitable for Q2 with the mill running at about 60% of its rated capacity. Very little of this product is going into housing yet. We are finding alternative uses for that, but we did achieve our APA panel stamp for our Brazilian products. 
So I'll finish my prepared remark with a few comments about the near future. The current demand environment, I would describe as, it has gone very flat. For us, it was an abrupt shift in the first week in June. In response to this, we will be taking the necessary downtime across all of our product lines to work down our finished good inventories to more closely match production with what we are currently experiencing for demand. 
Today, Q3, in terms of demand, feels a lot like Q3 of 2009. To us, it feels like demand was pulled forward into Q2 from Q3 and Q4. So in the short-term, the fundamentals that we all talk about that are dampening the demand for new home construction are still at play. High-end employment, we have 4.5% of the workforce that's unemployed and has been unemployed for over six months. Currently, we have low consumer confidence as they continued foreclosure in overhang issue. And we do have a slowing of household formation under these conditions. The current lack of housing demand, job growth and credit availability has created, I would call, a feeling of caution at all levels in our supply chain.
While I think we look at 2010 as overall better than 2009, I do expect the second half of 2010 to be quiet from what we are experiencing right now. Noticeable improvement may be delayed probably until 2011. So those are my comments. Curt?"

The first bucket is that not everything's is holding North Central.

There's probably a $15 per 1000 [square feet] price differential today. If you look during the quarter, we started the quarter with very little pricing on the West. It went up pretty significantly, but then it fell further. So any volume that would have gone to the West. So the adjust for that is probably about 1/3 of the difference that you just said is related to what regions we sell our product in and what the Random Lengths was in that area. The other thing, the second bucket is there are functional discounts for big purchasers. The latter the piece of it is as the price goes up, from a dollar standpoint, that goes up as the functional discounts are as a percentage. The third bucket for us is that we do sell our specialty products on a different way than daily trading. We generally provide a monthly pricing. So for our TechShield product, for our top-notch flooring products, we provide a pricing, a flat pricing during a particular month and then adjust that. And so when you're having a rapidly rising market, you don't capture all that. When you have a falling market, then we buy anything. And so you don't give the advantage of it going down.

And thank all of you for joining us on this conference call this afternoon.  I know it’s a little odd for us to have a Friday afternoon conference call, but we appreciate your indulgence.
As the operator said, I am Curt Stevens, the CFO.  And with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO, as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barkley who are primary investor relations contacts.
As I usually do, I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter.  I’ll follow that with some comments on the performance of our individual segment and talk a bit about the balance sheet.  
While I’d like to spend a lot of time talking about Q2 because it was such a good quarter for us, I suspect that what many of you are wondering about is where the market will go next.  
To that end, after I finish my comments, I’ll turn you over to Rick Frost who will give you his weather update for Nashville, discuss the general market environment in which we’re operating, and his perspective of both the most recent quarter and his thoughts for the rest of this year.
As we’ve done in the past, we have opened up the call to the public and are doing a webcast.  You may access that at our website www.lpcorp.com.
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation that has supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earning’s release.  And I will be referencing that document as I go though my comments.
This morning we did file an 8K that had supplemental information.  And we intend to file our Form 10Q later this afternoon.  
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on slide two of the presentation.  
Also be aware on slide three that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information.  And the necessary appendix for this is in the back of the presentation, as well as in the supplemental material that we filed with the Form 8K this morning.  I’m not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Direct your attention to slide four of the presentation for a discussion of the overall Q2 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter.  
Today we’re reporting net income for the second quarter of $22 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.  Net sales from continuing operations were $447 million for the quarter.  That’s an increase of nearly 2/3 compared to the second quarter of 2009.
The same period last year, we reported a net loss of $29 million, or $0.28 per diluted share on sales for continuing operations of $267 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA in continuing operations was a positive 75 million in the quarter compared to a loss of 11 million in Q2 in 2009.
Very small movement in the tax rate between the two quarters; Q2 of 2010 was 35%.  And last year the same quarter was 37%.  
On the earnings per share calculation, I would have you note that the basic average shares outstanding used in Q2 of 2010 is 25% higher than the same quarter last year.  And the diluted average shares outstanding is 36% higher.  This reflects the issuance of the shares in September of 2009 when we did the claw back equity offering, and the warrants that were attached to the 2017 subordinated notes.
In addition, as this was a profitable quarter, it takes into consideration the in-the-money invested options and stock-settled appreciation rights.
Slide five of the presentation is a discussion of our year-to-date results compared to last year.  For the year, we’re reporting basically, break-even net sales from continuing operations were 744 million, 57% higher than the first half of 2009.  For the same period last year, we reported a next loss on sales of 473 million.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the six months of $78 million this year compared to a loss of 36 million the prior year.
The tax rate in continuing operations looks a little funny here; as the company is close to break even, the discreet tax items have a much more meaningful impact on the rate.  So while it looks odd at 69%, it is based on very low, or very near break-even performance.
Let me now talk about each one of our segments.  
Slide six is an overview of our OSB segment.  OSB had operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the same quarter last year.
For the quarter, sales increased by more than double on a 24% increase in volume, and an average sales price that was 78% higher than the same quarter last year.  Obviously the increase in sales price created most of the improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA.
We believe the increase in OSB price was due to several factors.  We continue to have some raw material shortage, primarily to logs, caused by weather in the U.S. South.  We had an incremental real demand due to higher building activity.  We saw a desire of our customers to restock their severely depleted inventories in anticipation of a housing recovery.  
On the other side, as quickly as the plot price ran up at the end of the first quarter and into the middle of the second, it has dropped back down.  And North Central 7/16ths is currently below $200 per $1,000.  
Offsetting the positive impact of price in volume is we did have a strength in the Canadian dollar, which increased our cost in Canada.  
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was 58 million compared to a loss of 9 million in Q2 of last year.  
If we just look back to Q1, volumes were higher by 1/3, and prices increased by about that same amount, 36%.  
Year-to-date, OSB had an operating income of 43 million compared to an operating loss of 43 million the same period last year.  And adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was 62 million this year compared to a loss of 26 million.  Pricing accounted for most of that improvement, although we did have higher volumes as well.
Slide seven is our siding segment.  Just to remind you, this includes SmartSide, our Canexel siding product in Canada, and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill.  
For the second quarter, siding had operating income of $22 million, significantly better than the 7 million recorded in the same quarter last year.  
A piece of this improvement was related to the OSB sold in the segment, about 50 million square feet in both Q2 of 2010 - 2009, which contributed $4 million worth of earnings this quarter, and the same quarter last year, about a 2 million loss.  So 6 million of that swing is attributable to the improvement in OSB.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operation’s siding segment was 27 million compared to 11 million in Q2 of ’09.  
For the quarter, sales were up 25% with the unit volumes being better by 19% on SmartSide and down slightly in Canexel.  The reduction in our Canexel product line was caused by our decision to halt production on our 16-foot line as well as the discontinuance of our door skin business.  
For the quarter, SmartSide averaged sales prices were up 2%.  This is largely due to mix.  And Canexel prices showed a pretty significant increase, but that is related principally to the Canadian dollar and the strength of the Canadian dollar as well as the exit of our lower-priced product line being door skin.  
On a year-to-date basis, siding and operating income of 30 million compared to 9 million same period last year, with adjusted EBITDA being 41 million this year and 18 million in 2009.
As I mentioned in my earlier discussion, most of this improvement is from siding volume and the earnings turnaround in OSB, and it’s in accounted for in this sector.
Engineered wood is slide eight of the presentation.  This includes our I-joists, our laminated strand lumber produced in our home main facility, laminated veneer lumber, plus related products.  
It also includes the sale of I-joists produced by our Abitibi JV and LVL products that are produced under our arrangement with Murphy plywood.
For Q2, EWP reported a loss of less than half of what they did last year, 4 million versus 9.  Adjusted EBITDA of continuing operations was a loss of just under 1 million in the quarter compared to a loss of 6 million in Q2 of last year.
Volumes were up significantly.  I-joists up 29%, and LVL/LSL shipments up 46% compared to the same quarter.  
Pricing was up 7% in both I-joists and LVL.  That was due to a price increase that we put in several months ago to partially offset the higher raw material cost that we saw in OSB, veneer, and lumber.
On a year-to-date basis, the operating loss for EWP was 11 million compared to a loss of 18 million the same period, while EBITDA for comparable periods was 4 million in 2010 versus a loss of 12 million in 2009.
Our other building products, there’s no slide for this, but let me make a few comments.  Overall, we’re showing income of about $4 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to an income of about $1 million in the second quarter of 2009.  Most of that improvement is related to our South American operations.
For the quarter, sales were up 59% at $48 million compared to $30 million in Q2 of last year.  On a year-to-date basis, about $4 million of income compared to $2.2 in the same period last year with an increase in sales of 50%, getting us to $89 million for the first six months of this year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was 9.2 million in 2010 and 7 million in 2009.  
Some other things; we had a very small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about a $7 million gain in the same quarter last year.  The primary reason for this is at the end of 2009, we did refinance our Chilean term loan that was in U.S. dollars.  And the replacement load is denominated in Chilean pesos.  So we shouldn’t have a wide swing in our accounting results related for foreign currency gains and losses attributable to that loan.
The investment income in the quarter was lower than 2-2 of 2009.  Returns are down significantly with the low interest rate environment that we’re in.  
Interest expense was about 18 million compared to 22 million in Q2 of 2009.  This is primarily due to the claw back that we did on the subordinated notes last October.  
On the selling general administrative costs, they were flat between years to 29 million.  And for the unallocated, or the corporate piece of that, that was also flat at about 18 million in the quarter.  
Slide eight are some presentation of some key balance sheet statistics.  Our cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash was at 487 million at the end of June.  Working capital nearly $600 million.  Net cash of 210 million over the debt.  And there is an appendix in the presentation that provides that calculation.  
Capital expenditures were very low in the quarter at 5 million.  So we are on target to be less than 25 million, which is the guidance that we have been providing.  Book value per earning share was at $9.55.
One last thing I want to note before I turn it over to Rick is that we did receive the $115 million payment on the timber notes.  And we turned around and repaid 113 million of the limited-recourse debt at the end of the quarter.  
With that, let me turn it over to Rick.

True to form, we are having quite a warm and muggy summer in Nashville this year.  It’s about 95 out there today.
I guess in the name of full disclosure, at the end of business today, I’m headed for the coast of Maine for some vacation and to catch up with my wife.  And so really the call is today rather than next Tuesday so that I can have the weekend to do that.  So thank you for checking in on a Friday afternoon.
I will follow convention in my prepared remarks this afternoon to discuss Q2 results.  I want to make some observations about the quarter.  And then give you a sense of how Q3 feels to us right now.
I’ll begin with our core value of work place safety.  We had another excellent quarter operating safely.  All of our businesses year to date are operating with TIR of less than one.  And as a corporation, we are 0.44 at this time through June.  
Two-thirds of our plants remain injury free through the first half of this year compared to about half of the plants at this time last year.  And we did hit a number of significant milestones during the quarter at various plants.  To name two; our Panguipulli Mill in Chile set a new company best at over 1 ¼ million recordable free work hours.  And our Wilmington LVL plant reached three years without a reportable incident.
The regulatory environment proposes us uncertainty as we are waiting for the EPA to right its Boiler MAC targets, which we expect will be done in the first quarter of 2011.  And we are still wondering about what new CO2 regulations might surface.  
I’m only mentioning that because we do not have a clear impact, or view of these impacts at this time, but it is on the radar screen.
And our lean Six Sigma program, in its third full year of implementation, continues to deliver for us about 5.7 to 1 as a return rate this year to date.  
As Curt mentioned, our financial performance in Q2 was a great breath of fresh air for us.  Business activity was quite brisk during the first two months of the second quarter followed then by what I would characterize as a relatively dead June.
As Curt explained, the Q2 ‘10 to Q2 ’09 comparisons are good.  They’re good storied.  They show the financial leverage, in my opinion, that we have with just a little bit of additional demand.
OSB was the big story with the first five weeks of the quarter experiencing rapidly rising prices as demand spiked unexpectedly on a thin-channel inventory.  That was followed by the next five weeks of rapidly falling prices.  And the month of June was relatively flat.  
Our sales volume was up about 24% Q2 to Q2.  And the pricing story was significant.  
Our effective production capacity ratio, which I have defined as what we produce divided by the mills that we currently have running, was 86% for the quarter.  If we include our indefinitely shuttered mills capacity in that denominator, that dropped to 66%.  In Q1 of 2010, those numbers were 68% and 52% respectively.  
I had the opportunity in the last couple of months to speak to several analyst conferences, at which time I was asked the question around the highball utility around OSB pricing.  
We entered the quarter at a North Central 7/16ths print of about 220.  That ascended to a high, I think, of about 395.  And then we actually ended the quarter down at $200 per MSF.  
And the analogy that might help in understanding this volatility is for me to imagine a truck with the suspension and the shocks removed.  And that was the supply chain as we went into the beginning of the quarter.  There were just no buffers to absorb any bumps.  And so when the bumps occurred, they were metal on metal, so to speak.  We had a demand increase.  We think that was associated with the efforts to come in under the tax credit deadline.
Pressure mounted for takeaways; the channel had very little inventory.  And we had little inventory, and little ability to add production.  So there was a hard bounce up.  And of course, then we had a hard down reaction towards the end of the quarter.
My people said it this way not too long ago; they said in March and April we could hardly keep up with the consumer and the builder.  In May, the builder was finishing up and they quit placing more orders.  And in June, the consumer and the builders basically shut down.  Our order file then shortened, and then we started to readjust our output to the lower demands.
Our experience was that business did noticeable slow down on Memorial Day Weekend, both from a distribution standpoint and a retail standpoint.  
I’ll move now to a short discussion of our siding product segment.  Siding did have an excellent quarter.  Our profits were up from 6.5 million in Q2 of last year to 21.8 million in Q2 of this year.  And as Curt pointed out, 4 million of that was from OSB pricing and the OSB volume that we manufacture at our Hayward plant.  The volumes at Hayward Q2 to Q2 were about the same.  
Our SmartSide volume was up Q2 to Q2 by 20%.  We continue to gain traction in siding in both the retail sector and the distribution sector as the builder’s and homeowner’s delight with this product continues to increase.  
Our rolling four quarter volume for North American housing start, year-over-year change in siding is up 33%.  And this number excludes retail and our shed business.
In engineered wood products, the uptick in volumes in Q2 of this year over last year, along with implementing the general sales price increase, did allow us to pair our losses considerably, about 47% Q2 to Q2.  
Our major bleeder in this business remains our LSL product segment, as we only run that mill at about 14% of its capacity in this difficult market.  
Engineered wood, as you know, is the most highly-tied segment to new housing starts.  But we are making some inroads with our West Coast LDL in Australia, and with our LSL product in Europe.  
From a market penetration perspective, we did capture almost 500 market wins in Q2.  As you may remember, I define a market win as an additional product placement with an existing customer, or a product placement with a new customer.  Over 100 of these were in our SmartSide Trim product line, and 60 were with our LSL product.  
TechShield, our radiant-barrier roof sheeting does continue to grow, and is actually up in volume 40% in per-start calculation year over year.  
Another slice on all of this that’s important to me is that we had 132 dealer wins in those 500 wins in Q2.  And the dealer win is a large part of our current focus.  The dealer is critical to connect the supply chain between our efforts to partner with the distributor and do pull through selling to the builder.  
I’ll finish my discussion with Q2 with a few comments of South America.  
We are off to our best year ever in Chile; our highest volumes and our highest profits.  Both Chile and OSB mills are running full out as a result of the February earthquake.  We have also spiked some of their short-term needs with volume from Brazil.  
Most of the spike in demand in Chile so far has just been related to the short-term temporary needs from the catastrophe and not related yet to the longer term rebuilding efforts that need to occur.  And we are heartened to see that the frame-build construction in Chile did fair far better under the earthquake conditions.  So we think that will continue to aid our efforts at converting building practices in Chile.
Brazil was also profitable for Q2 with the mill running at about 60% of its rated capacity.  Very little of this product is going into housing yet.  We are finding alternative uses for that, but we did achieve our APA panel stamp for our Brazilian product. 
So I’ll finish my prepared remark with a few comments about the near future.  The current demand environment, I would describe as it has gone very quiet.  For us, it was an abrupt shift in the first week of June.  
In response to this, we will be taking the necessary downtime across all of our product lines to work down our finished-goods inventories to more closely match production with what we are currently experiencing for demand.
Today, Q3 in terms of demand, feels a lot like Q3 of 2009.  To us, it feels like demand was pulled forward into Q2 from Q3 and Q4.  
So in the short term, the fundamentals that we all talk about that are dampening the demand for new-home construction are still at play.  High unemployment; we have 4 1/2 % of the workforce that’s employed has been unemployed for over six months.  
Currently, we have low consumer confidence as a continued-foreclosure and overhang issue.  And we do have a slowing of household formation under these conditions.  
The current lack of housing demand, job growth, and credit availability has created, I would call, a feeling of caution at all levels in our supply chain.  
While I think we look at 2010 as overall better than 2009, I do expect the second half of 2010 to be quiet from what we are experiencing right now.  Noticeable improvement may be delayed probably until 2011.
Those are my comments.  Curt.

And then maybe help us understand why there wouldn’t have been more volume efficiencies.  
And the quick math of why I say that is if you look at your price improvement and you look at your volume, that alone would have gotten you about a $50, $55 million improvement relative to the prior quarter.

Probably the bigger difference, if we look at Q2 ’09 to Q2 ’10 on the raw materials side, we had about, across the corporation, about a $9 million increase in our cost.  About $1.5 million of that was the logs, and the rest was in resins and waxes associated with a higher cost of the oil-based raw materials.  So fundamentally it’s in those areas, the Canadian dollar and the high raw materials cost.

And I would imagine you ran again better volumes in the second quarter, unless we’re just mistaken because you took a lot of downtime in say June.  But is there anything else you can point us to as to why we might not have seen better cost improvement.
And by the way, I also notice when I look at random links, that price averaged up, well, let’s say a year-over-year $128 on a 3/8ths basis, not 7/16ths.  And your pricing was at $108, so maybe you could help us understand why your pricing - and I know that you don’t track exactly North Central random links, but is there anything you can do to help us understand what might have happened there?

The first bucket is that not everything is sold in North Central.  So if you look at it, you actually will have at any given time - I think today you probably have between the Mid-Atlantic and the North Central, there’s probably a $15 per 1,000 price differential today.
If you look during the quarter, we started the quarter with very low pricing on the West.  It went up pretty significantly, but then it fell further.  So any volume that would have gone into the West.  So the adjust for that is probably about 1/3 of the difference that you just said is related to what regions we sell our product in and what the random links was in that area.
The other thing, the second bucket is there are functional discounts for big purchasers.  So that is a piece of it.  As the price goes up from a dollar standpoint, that goes up as the functional discounts are a percentage.
The third bucket for us is that we do sell our specialty products on a different way than daily trading.  We generally provide a monthly pricing.  So for textural products, for our top-notch flooring products, we provide a pricing, a flat pricing during a particular month, and then adjust that.  
And so when you have a rapidly rising market, you don’t capture all that.  When you have a falling market, nobody is buying anything.  And so you don’t get the advantage of it going down.  So those would be the three buckets.

As the operator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO, and with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO, as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts. 
As I usually do, I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter. I'll follow that with some comments on the performance of our individual segment and talk a bit about the balance sheet.
While I'd like to spend a lot of time talking about Q2 because it was such a good quarter for us, I suspect that what many of you are wondering about is where the market will go next. To that end, after I finish my comments, I'll turn you over to Rick Frost, who will give you his weather update for Nashville, discuss the general market environment in which we're operating and his perspective on both the most recent quarter, and his thoughts for the rest of this year. 
As we've done in the past, we have opened up the call to the public, and are doing a webcast, can be accessed at our webcast, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation that has supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction to the earnings release, and I will be referencing that document as I go through my comments.
This morning, we did file an 8-K that had supplemental information and we intend to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. 
Also, be aware on Slide 3 that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information. And the necessary appendix for this is in the back of the presentation, as well as in the supplemental material that we filed with the Form 8-K this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Direct your attention to Slide 4 of the presentation, for our discussion of the overall Q2 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Today, we're reporting net income for the second quarter of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $447 million for the quarter. That's an increase of nearly 2/3 compared to the second quarter of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported net loss of $29 million or $0.28 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $267 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $75 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $11 million in Q2 of 2009. Very small movement in the tax rate between the two quarters, Q2 2010 was 35% and last year the same quarter was 37%. 
On the earnings per share calculation, I would have you note that the basic average shares outstanding used in Q2 of 2010 is 25% higher than the same quarter last year and the diluted average shares outstanding is 36% higher. This reflects the issuance of the shares in September 2009, when we did the claw back equity offering, and the warrants that were attached to the 2017 subordinated notes. In addition, as this was a profitable quarter, it takes into consideration the in-the-money vested options in Stock Settled Appreciation Rights.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of our year-to-date results compared to last year. For the year, we're reporting basically breakeven. Net sales from continuing operations were $744 million, 57% higher than the first half of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss on sales of $473 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months is $78 million this year compared to a loss of $36 million the prior year. The tax rate on continuing operations looks a little funny here. As a company is close to breakeven, the discrete tax items have a much more meaningful impact on the rate. So while it looks odd at 69%, it is based on very low or very near break-even performance. 
Let me now talk about each one of our segments. Slide 6 is an overview of our OSB segment. OSB had an operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the same quarter last year. For the quarter, sales increased by more than double on a 24% increase in volume, and an average sales price of a 78% higher than the same quarter last year. Obviously, the increase in sales price created most of the improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. We believe the increase in OSB price was due to several factors. We continue to have some raw material shortages, primarily the logs caused by weather in the U.S. South. We had an incremental real demand due to higher building activity. We saw a desire of our customers to restock their severely depleted inventories, in anticipation of a housing recovery. 
On the other side, as quickly as price ran up at the end of the first quarter into the middle of the second, it has dropped back down, and North Central 7/16 is currently below $200 per thousand. Offsetting the positive impact of price and volume is we did have a strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increased our cost in Canada. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was $58 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q2 of last year. If we just look back to Q1, volumes were higher by 1/3 and prices increased by about that same amount, 36%.
Year-to-date, OSB had an operating income of $43 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $62 million this year compared to a loss of $26 million. Pricing accounted for most of that improvement, although we did have higher volumes as well. 
Slide 7 is our Siding segment. Just to remind you, this includes SmartSide, our CanExel Siding product in Canada, and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the second quarter, Siding had operating income of $22 million, significantly better than the $7 million recorded in the same quarter last year. A piece of this improvement was related to the OSB sold in the segment, about 50 million square feet in both Q2 of 2010, 2009, which contributed $4 million worth of earnings this quarter, and same quarter last year, about a $2 million loss. So $6 million of that swing is attributable to the improvement in OSB.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of Siding segment was $27 million compared to $11 million in Q2 of '09. For the quarter, sales were up 25%, with unit volumes being better by 19% in SmartSide, and down slightly in CanExel. The reduction in our CanExel product line was caused by our decision to halt production on our 16-foot line, as well as a discontinuance of our Door Skin business. For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 2%, this is largely due to mix. And CanExel prices showed a pretty significant increase, but that is related principally to the Canadian dollar, and the improvement or the strength of the Canadian dollar, as well as the exit of our lower-priced product line, being Door Skin. 
On a year-to-date basis, Siding had operating income of $30 million compared to $9 million same period last year, with adjusted EBITDA being $41 million this year and $18 million in 2009. As I mentioned in my earlier discussion, most of this improvement is from Siding volume and the earnings turnaround in OSB, that is in -- not important as the sector.
Engineered Wood is Slide 8 of the presentation. This includes our I-Joist, our Laminated Strand Lumber produced in our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber, plus related products. It also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our Abitibi JV and LVL products that are produced under our arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of less than a cap of what they did last year, $4 million versus $9 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of just under $1 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $6 million in Q2 of last year. Volumes were up significantly. I-Joist up 29%, and LVL/LSL shipments up 46% compared to the same quarter. Pricing was up 7% in both I-Joist and LVL. That was due to a price increase that we put in several months ago, that partially offset the higher raw material cost that we saw in OSB, veneer and lumber. On a year-to-date basis, the operating loss for EWP was $11 million compared to loss of $18 million in the same period. While EBITDA was for a comparable periods was $4 million in 2010 versus a loss of $12 million in 2009.
Our Other Building Products, there's no slide for this, but let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing income of about $4 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to income of about $1 million in the second quarter of 2009. Most of that improvement is related to our South American operations. For the quarter, sales were up 59% at $48 million compared to $30 million in Q2 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, about $4 million in income compared to $2.2 million in the same period last year, with an increase in sales of 50%, getting us to $89 million for the first six months of this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $9.2 million in 2010 and $7 million in 2009. Some other things, we had a very small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about a $7 million gain in the same quarter last year. The primary reason for this is at the end of 2009, we did refinance our Chilean term loan, that was in U.S. dollars and the replacement loan is denominated in Chilean pesos. So we shouldn't have a wide swings in our accounting results related to foreign currency gains and losses attributable to that loan. 
Investment income in the quarter was lower than Q2 of 2009. Returns are down significantly with the low interest rate environment that we're in. Interest expense was about $18 million compared to $22 million in Q2 of 2009. This is primarily due to the claw back that we did on the subordinated notes last October. On the selling, general, administrative costs, they were flat between years, $29 million. And for the unallocated, the corporate piece of that, that was also flat, at about $18 million in the quarter. 
Slide 8 of the presentation are some key balance sheet statistics. Our cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was at $487 million at the end of June. Working capital, nearly $600 million. Net cash at $210 million, over the debt, and there is an appendix in the presentation that provides that calculation. Capital expenditures were very low in the quarter at $5 million. So we are in target to be less than $25 million, which is the guidance that we have been providing. Book value per earning share was at $9.55. 
One last thing I would want to note before I turn it over to Rick is that we did receive the $115 million payment on the timber notes. And we turned around and repaid $113 million of the limited recourse debt at the end of the quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

True to form, we are having quite a warm and muggy summer in Nashville this year. It's about 95 out there today. I guess in the name of full disclosure, at the end of business today, I'm headed for the coast of Maine for some vacation and to catch up with my wife. And so really the call is today rather than next Tuesday, so that I can have the weekend to do that. So thank you for checking in on a Friday afternoon. I will follow convention in my prepared remarks this afternoon to discuss Q2 results. I want to make some observations about the quarter, and then give you a sense of how Q3 feels to us right now. 
I'll begin with our core value of workplace safety. We had another excellent quarter operating safely. All of our businesses year-to-date are operating with a TIR of less than 1. And as a Corporation, we are 0.44 at this time through June. 2/3 of our plants remained injury-free through the first half of this year compared to about half of the plants at this time last year. And we did hit a number of significant milestones during the quarter at various plants. To name two, our Panguipulli mill in Chile set a new company best at over 1.25 million recordable free work hours, and our Wilmington LVL plant reached three years without a recordable incident. The regulatory environment proposes us uncertainty, as we are waiting for the EPA to write its weather map targets, in which we expect will be done in the first quarter of 2011. And we are still wondering about what new CO2 regulations might surface. I'm only mentioning that because we do not have a clear impact, a view of these impacts at this time, but it is on the radar screen.
And our Lean Six Sigma Program, in its third full year of implementation, continues to deliver for us about 5.7:1 as a return rate this year to date. As Curt mentioned, our financial performance in Q2 was a great breath of fresh air for us. Business activity was quite brisk during the first two months of the second quarter, followed then by what I would characterize as a relatively dead due. As Curt explained, the Q2 '10, the Q2 '09 comparisons are good. They're a good story. They showed a financial leverage, in my opinion, that we have with just a little bit of additional demand. 
OSB was the biggest story with the first five weeks of the quarter experiencing rapidly rising prices, as demand spiked unexpectedly on an end-channel inventory. That was followed by the next five weeks of rapidly falling prices and the month of June was relatively flat. Our sales volume was up about 24% Q2 to Q2, and the pricing story was significant. 
Our effective production capacity ratio, which I have defined as what we've produced divided by the mills that we currently have running, was 86% for the quarter. If we include our indefinitely-shuttered mills capacity in that denominator, that dropped to 66%. In Q1 of 2010, those numbers were 68% and 52%, respectively. 
I had the opportunity in the last couple of months to speak to several analyst conferences during -- at which time, I was asked the question around the high volatility around OSB pricing. We entered the quarter at North Central 7/16 sprint of about 220 had ascended to a high, I think, of about 395, and then we actually ended the quarter down at $200 per MSF. Now the analogy that might help in understanding this volatility is for me to imagine a truck with the suspension on the shocks removed, and that was the supply chain as we went into the beginning of the quarter. There were just no buffers to absorb any bumps. And so when the bumps occurred, they were metal-on-metal, so to speak. 
We had a demand increase. We think that was associated with the efforts to come in under the tax credit deadline. Pressure mounted for takeaways. The channel had very little inventory. And we had little inventory and little ability to add production, so there was a hard bounce up. And of course, then we had a hard down reaction towards the quarter. 
As one of my people said it this way not too long ago, they said in March and April, we could hardly keep up with the consumer and the builder. In May, the builder was finishing up and they quit placing more orders. And in June, the consumer and the builders basically shut down. Our order files have shortened and then we started to readjust our output to the lower demands. Our experience was that business did noticeably slow down on Memorial Day weekend, both from a distribution standpoint and a retail standpoint. 
I'll move now to a short discussion of our Siding Products segment. Siding did have an excellent quarter. Our profits were up from $6.5 million in Q2 of last year to $21.8 million in Q2 of this year. And as Curt pointed out, $4 million of that was from OSB pricing from the OSB volume that we manufacture at our Hayward plant. The volumes at Hayward Q2-to-Q2 were about the same. 
Our SmartSide volume was up Q2-to-Q2 by 20%. We continued to gain traction in Siding in both the retail sector and the distribution sector, as the builder and homeowner delight with this product continues to increase. 
A rolling fourth quarter volume for North American housing start year-over-year change in the Siding is up 33%. And this numbers excludes retail and our Sheath business. In Engineered Wood Products, the uptick in volumes in Q2 of this year over last year, along with implementing the general sales price increase did allow us to pay our losses considerably about 47% Q2-to-Q2. Our major bleeder in this business remains our LSL Products segment, as we only run that mill at about 14% of its capacity in this difficult market. Engineered Wood, as you know, is the most highly tied segment to new housing starts. But we are making some inroads with our West Coast LVL in Australia and with our LSL product in Europe.
From a market penetration perspective, we did capture almost 500 market wins in Q2. As you may remember, I define a market win as an additional product placement with an existing customer or a product placement with a new customer. Over 100 of these were in our SmartSide Trim product line and 60 were with our LSL product. TechShield, our radiant barrier roof sheathing, does continue to grow and is actually up in volume 40% in a per-start calculation year-over-year. Another slice on all of these that's important to me is that we had 132 dealer wins in those 500 wins in Q2. And the dealer win is a large part of our current focus. The dealer is critical to connect the supply chain between our efforts to partner with the distributor and do pull-through selling to the builder.
I'll finish my discussion with Q2 with a few comments on South America. We are off to our best year ever in Chile, our highest volumes and our highest profits. Both Chilean OSB mills are running full out as a result of the February earthquake. We have also spiked some of their short-term needs with volume from Brazil. Most of the spike in demand in Chile so far has just been related to the short-term, temporary needs from the catastrophe and not related yet to the longer-term rebuilding efforts that need to occur. And we are heartened to see that the frame built construction in Chile did fare far better under the earthquake conditions. So we think that will continue to aid our efforts at converting building prices in Chile. Brazil was also profitable for Q2 with the mill running at about 60% of its rated capacity. Very little of this product is going into housing yet. We are finding alternative uses for that, but we did achieve our APA panel stamp for our Brazilian products. 
So I'll finish my prepared remark with a few comments about the near future. The current demand environment, I would describe as, it has gone very flat. For us, it was an abrupt shift in the first week in June. In response to this, we will be taking the necessary downtime across all of our product lines to work down our finished good inventories to more closely match production with what we are currently experiencing for demand. 
Today, Q3, in terms of demand, feels a lot like Q3 of 2009. To us, it feels like demand was pulled forward into Q2 from Q3 and Q4. So in the short-term, the fundamentals that we all talk about that are dampening the demand for new home construction are still at play. High unemployment, we have 4.5% of the workforce that's unemployed and has been unemployed for over six months. Currently, we have low consumer confidence, and a continued foreclosure and overhang issue, and we do have a slowing of household formation under these conditions. The current lack of housing demand, job growth and credit availability has created, I would call a, feeling of caution at all levels in our supply chain.
While I think we look at 2010 as overall better than 2009, I do expect the second half of 2010 to be quiet, from what we are experiencing right now. Noticeable improvement maybe delayed probably until 2011. So those are my comments. Curt?"

About $1.5 million of that was in the logs and the rest was in resins and waxes associated with the higher cost of the oil-based raw materials.

There's probably a $15 per 1000 [square feet] price differential today. If you look during the quarter, we started the quarter with very little pricing on the West. It went up pretty significantly, but then it fell further. So any volume that would have gone to the West. So the adjust for that is probably about 1/3 of the difference that you just said is related to what regions we sell our product in and what the Random Lengths was in that area. The other thing, the second bucket is there are functional discounts for big purchasers. The latter the piece of it is as the price goes up, from a dollar standpoint, that goes up as the functional discounts are as a percentage. The third bucket for us is that we do sell our specialty products on a different way than daily trading. We generally provide a monthly pricing. So for our TechShield product, for our top-notch flooring products, we provide a pricing, a flat pricing during a particular month and then adjust that. And so when you're having a rapidly rising market, you don't capture all that. When you have a falling market, then we buy anything. And so you don't give the advantage of it going down.

As the operator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO, and with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO, as well as Mike Kenny and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts. 
As I usually do, I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter. I'll follow that with some comments on the performance of our individual segment and talk a bit about the balance sheet.
While I'd like to spend a lot of time talking about Q2 because it was such a good quarter for us, I suspect that what many of you are wondering about is where the market will go next. To that end, after I finish my comments, I'll turn you over to Rick Frost, who will give you his weather update for Nashville, discuss the general market environment in which we're operating and his perspective on both the most recent quarter, and his thoughts for the rest of this year. 
As we've done in the past, we have opened up the call to the public, and are doing a webcast, can be accessed at our website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation that has supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release, and I will be referencing that document as I go through my comments.
This morning, we did file an 8-K that had supplemental information and we intend to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation. 
Also, be aware on Slide 3 that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information. And the necessary appendix for this is in the back of the presentation, as well as in the supplemental material that we filed with the Form 8-K this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Direct your attention to Slide 4 of the presentation, for a discussion of the overall Q2 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. Today, we're reporting net income for the second quarter of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $447 million for the quarter. That's an increase of nearly 2/3 compared to the second quarter of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported net loss of $29 million or $0.28 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $267 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $75 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $11 million in Q2 of 2009. Very small movement in the tax rate between the two quarters, Q2 of 2010 was 35%, and last year the same quarter was 37%. 
On the earnings per share calculation, I would have you note that the basic average shares outstanding used in Q2 of 2010 is 25% higher than the same quarter last year and the diluted average shares outstanding is 36% higher. This reflects the issuance of the shares in September 2009 when we did the claw back equity offering and the warrants that were attached to the 2017 subordinated notes. In addition, as this was a profitable quarter, it takes into consideration the in-the-money vested options in Stock Settled Appreciation Rights.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of our year-to-date results compared to last year. For the year, we're reporting basically breakeven. Net sales from continuing operations were $744 million, 57% higher than the first half of 2009. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss on sales of $473 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months is $78 million this year compared to a loss of $36 million the prior year. The tax rate in continuing operations looks a little funny here. As a company is close to breakeven, the discrete tax items have a much more meaningful impact on the rate. So while it looks odd at 69%, it is based on very low or very near break-even performance. 
Let me now talk about each one of our segments. Slide 6 is an overview of our OSB segment. OSB had an operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the same quarter last year. For the quarter, sales increased by more than double on a 24% increase in volume, and an average sales price of a 78% higher than the same quarter last year. Obviously, the increase in sales price created most of the improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. We believe the increase in OSB price was due to several factors. We continue to have some raw material shortages, primarily to logs caused by weather in the U.S. South. We had the incremental real demand due to higher building activity. We saw a desire of our customers to restock their severely depleted inventories in anticipation of a housing recovery. 
On the other side, as quickly as the price ran up at the end of the first quarter into the middle of the second, it has dropped back down, and North Central 7/16 is currently below $200 per thousand. Offsetting the positive impact of price and volume is we did have a strengthening of the Canadian dollar which increased our cost in Canada. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was $58 million compared to a loss of $9 million in Q2 of last year. If we just look back to Q1, volumes were higher by 1/3 and prices increased by about that same amount, 36%.
Year-to-date, OSB had an operating income of $43 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $62 million this year compared to a loss of $26 million. Pricing accounted for most of that improvement, although we did have higher volumes as well. 
Slide 7 is our Siding segment. Just to remind you, this includes SmartSide, our CanExel Siding product in Canada, and commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the second quarter, Siding had operating income of $22 million, significantly better than the $7 million recorded in the same quarter last year. A piece of this improvement was related to the OSB sold in the segment, about 50 million square feet in both Q2 of 2010, 2009, which contributed $4 million worth of earnings this quarter, in the same quarter last year, about a $2 million loss. So $6 million of that swing is attributable to the improvement in OSB.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of the Siding segment was $27 million compared to $11 million in Q2 of '09. For the quarter, sales were up 25%, with unit volumes being better by 19% in SmartSide, and down slightly in CanExel. The reduction in our CanExel product line was caused by our decision to halt production on our 16-foot line, as well as a discontinuance of our Door Skin business. For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 2%, this is largely due to mix. And CanExel prices showed a pretty significant increase, but that is related principally to the Canadian dollar, and the improvement or the strength of the Canadian dollar, as well as the exit of our lower-priced product line, being Door Skin. 
On a year-to-date basis, Siding had operating income of $30 million compared to $9 million same period last year, with adjusted EBITDA being $41 million this year and $18 million in 2009. As I mentioned in my earlier discussion, most of this improvement is from Siding volume and the earnings turnaround in OSB, that's accounted for in this sector.
Engineered Wood is Slide 8 of the presentation. This includes our I-Joist, our Laminated Strand Lumber produced in our Houlton, Maine facility, Laminated Veneer Lumber, plus related products. It also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our Abitibi JV and LVL products that are produced under our arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of less than a cap of what they did last year, $4 million versus $9 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of just under $1 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $6 million in Q2 of last year. Volumes were up significantly. I-Joist up 29%, and LVL/LSL shipments up 46% compared to the same quarter. Pricing was up 7% in both I-Joist and LVL. That was due to a price increase that we put in several months ago, that partially offset the higher raw material cost that we saw in OSB, Veneer and Lumber. On a year-to-date basis, the operating loss for EWP was $11 million compared to loss of $18 million in the same period. While EBITDA for comparable periods was $4 million in 2010 versus a loss of $12 million in 2009.
Our Other Building Products, there's no slide for this, but let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing income of about $4 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to income of about $1 million in the second quarter of 2009. Most of that improvement is related to our South American operations. For the quarter, sales were up 59% at $48 million compared to $30 million in Q2 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, about $4 million in income compared to $2.2 million in the same period last year, with an increase in sales of 50%, getting us to $89 million for the first six months of this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $9.2 million in 2010 and $7 million in 2009. Some other things, we had a very small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about a $7 million gain in the same quarter last year. The primary reason for this is at the end of 2009, we did refinance our Chilean term loan that was in U.S. dollars and the replacement loan is denominated in Chilean pesos. So we shouldn't have a wide swings in our accounting results related to foreign currency gains and losses attributable to that loan. 
Investment income in the quarter was lower than Q2 of 2009. Returns are down significantly with the low interest rate environment that we're in. Interest expense was about $18 million compared to $22 million in Q2 of 2009. This is primarily due to the claw back that we did on the subordinated notes last October. On the selling, general, administrative costs, they were flat between the areas of $29 million. And for the unallocated, the corporate piece of that, that was also flat, at about $18 million in the quarter. 
Slide 8 of the presentation are some key balance sheet statistics. Our cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was at $487 million at the end of June. Working capital, nearly $600 million. Net cash at $210 million, over the debt, and there is an appendix in the presentation that provide that calculation. Capital expenditures were very low in the quarter at $5 million. So we are in target to be less than $25 million, which is the guidance that we have been providing. Book value per earning share was at $9.55. 
One last thing I would want to note before I turn it over to Rick is that we did receive the $115 million payment on the timber notes. And we turned around and repaid $113 million of the limited recourse debt at the end of the quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

I guess in the name of full d",1615,"Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for your interest in our LP Building Products second quarter call. True to form, we are having quite a warm and muggy summer in Nashville this year. It's about 95 out there today. I guess in the name of full disclosure, at the end of business today, I'm headed for the coast of Maine for some vacation and to catch up with my wife. And so really, the call is today rather than next Tuesday, so that I can have the weekend to do that. So thank you for checking in on a Friday afternoon. I will follow convention in my prepared remarks this afternoon to discuss Q2 results. I want to make some observations about the quarter, and then give you a sense of how Q3 feels to us right now. 
I'll begin with our core value of workplace safety. We had another excellent quarter operating safely. All of our businesses year-to-date are operating with a TIR of less than 1. And as a Corporation, we are 0.44 at this time through June. 2/3 of our plants remained injury-free through the first half of this year compared to about half of the plants at this time last year. And we did hit a number of significant milestones during the quarter at various plants. To name two, our Panguipulli mill in Chile set a new company best at over 1.25 million recordable free work hours, and our Wilmington LVL plant reached three years without a recordable incident. The regulatory environment proposes us uncertainty, as we are waiting for the EPA to write its weather map targets, in which we expect will be done in the first quarter of 2011. And we are still wondering about what new CO2 regulations might surface. I'm only mentioning that because we do not have a clear impact, a view of these impacts at this time, but it is on the radar screen.
And our Lean Six Sigma Program, in its third full year of implementation, continues to deliver for us about 5.7:1 as a return rate this year to date. As Curt mentioned, our financial performance in Q2 was a great breath of fresh air for us. Business activity was quite brisk during the first two months of the second quarter, followed then by what I would characterize as a relatively dead due. As Curt explained, the Q2 '10, the Q2 '09 comparisons are good. They're a good story. They showed a financial leverage, in my opinion, that we have with just a little bit of additional demand. 
OSB was the biggest story with the first five weeks of the quarter experiencing rapidly rising prices, as demand spiked unexpectedly on an end-channel inventory. That was followed by the next five weeks of rapidly falling prices and the month of June was relatively flat. Our sales volume was up about 24% Q2 to Q2, and the pricing story was significant. 
Our effective production capacity ratio, which I have defined as what we've produced divided by the mills that we currently have running, was 86% for the quarter. If we include our indefinitely-shuttered mills capacity in that denominator, that dropped to 66%. In Q1 of 2010, those numbers were 68% and 52%, respectively. 
I had the opportunity in the last couple of months to speak to several analyst conferences during -- at which time, I was asked the question around the high volatility around OSB pricing. We entered the quarter at North Central 7/16 sprint of about 220 had ascended to a high, I think, of about 395, and then we actually ended the quarter down at $200 per MSF. Now the analogy that might help in understanding this volatility is for me to imagine a truck with the suspension on the shocks removed, and that was the supply chain as we went into the beginning of the quarter. There were just no buffers to absorb any bumps. And so when the bumps occurred, they were metal-on-metal, so to speak. 
We had a demand increase. We think that was associated with the efforts to come in under the tax credit deadline. Pressure mounted for takeaways. The channel had very little inventory. And we had little inventory and little ability to add production, so there was a hard bounce up. And of course, then we had a hard down reaction towards the quarter. 
As one of my people said it this way not too long ago, they said in March and April, we could hardly keep up with the consumer and the builder. In May, the builder was finishing up and they quit placing more orders. And in June, the consumer and the builders basically shut down. Our order files have shortened and then we started to readjust our output to the lower demands. Our experience was that business did noticeably slow down on Memorial Day weekend, both from a distribution standpoint and a retail standpoint. 
I'll move now to a short discussion of our Siding Products segment. Siding did have an excellent quarter. Our profits were up from $6.5 million in Q2 of last year to $21.8 million in Q2 of this year. And as Curt pointed out, $4 million of that was from OSB pricing from the OSB volume that we manufacture at our Hayward plant. The volumes at Hayward Q2-to-Q2 were about the same. 
Our SmartSide volume was up Q2-to-Q2 by 20%. We continued to gain traction in Siding in both the retail sector and the distribution sector, as the builder and homeowner delight with this product continues to increase. 
A rolling fourth quarter volume for North American housing start year-over-year change in the Siding is up 33%. And this numbers excludes retail and our Sheath business. In Engineered Wood Products, the uptick in volumes in Q2 of this year over last year, along with implementing the general sales price increase did allow us to pay our losses considerably about 47% Q2-to-Q2. Our major bleeder in this business remains our LSL Products segment, as we only run that mill at about 14% of its capacity in this difficult market. Engineered Wood, as you know, is the most highly tied segment to new housing starts. But we are making some inroads with our West Coast LVL in Australia and with our LSL product in Europe.
From a market penetration perspective, we did capture almost 500 market wins in Q2. As you may remember, I define a market win as an additional product placement with an existing customer or a product placement with a new customer. Over 100 of these were in our SmartSide Trim product line and 60 were with our LSL product. TechShield, our radiant barrier roof sheathing, does continue to grow and is actually up in volume 40% in a per-start calculation year-over-year. Another slice on all of these that's important to me is that we had 132 dealer wins in those 500 wins in Q2. And the dealer win is a large part of our current focus. The dealer is critical to connect the supply chain between our efforts to partner with the distributor and do pull-through selling to the builder.
I'll finish my discussion with Q2 with a few comments on South America. We are off to our best year ever in Chile, our highest volumes and our highest profits. Both Chilean OSB mills are running full out as a result of the February earthquake. We have also spiked some of their short-term needs with volume from Brazil. Most of the spike in demand in Chile so far has just been related to the short-term, temporary needs from the catastrophe and not related yet to the longer-term rebuilding efforts that need to occur. And we are heartened to see that the frame built construction in Chile did fare far better under the earthquake conditions. So we think that will continue to aid our efforts at converting building prices in Chile. Brazil was also profitable for Q2 with the mill running at about 60% of its rated capacity. Very little of this product is going into housing yet. We are finding alternative uses for that, but we did achieve our APA panel stamp for our Brazilian products. 
So I'll finish my prepared remark with a few comments about the near future. The current demand environment, I would describe as, it has gone very flat. For us, it was an abrupt shift in the first week in June. In response to this, we will be taking the necessary downtime across all of our product lines to work down our finished good inventories to more closely match production with what we are currently experiencing for demand. 
Today, Q3, in terms of demand, feels a lot like Q3 of 2009. To us, it feels like demand was pulled forward into Q2 from Q3 and Q4. So in the short-term, the fundamentals that we all talk about that are dampening the demand for new home construction are still at play. High unemployment, we have 4.5% of the workforce that's unemployed and has been unemployed for over six months. Currently, we have low consumer confidence, and a continued foreclosure and overhang issue, and we do have a slowing of household formation under these conditions. The current lack of housing demand, job growth and credit availability has created, I would call, a feeling of caution at all levels in our supply chain.
While I think we look at 2010 as overall better than 2009, I do expect the second half of 2010 to be quiet, from what we are experiencing right now. Noticeable improvement may be delayed probably until 2011. So those are my comments. Curt?"

The first bucket is that not everything's is holding North Central. So if you look at it, you actually, will have at any given time, I think, today, you probably have between the Mid-Atlantic and North Central. There's probably a $15 per 1000 [square feet] price differential today. If you look during the quarter, we started the quarter with very little pricing on the West. It went up pretty significantly, but then it fell further. So any volume that would have gone to the West. So the adjust for that is probably about 1/3 of the difference that you just said is related to what regions we sell our product in and what the Random Lengths was in that area. The other thing, the second bucket is there are functional discounts for big purchasers. The latter the piece of it is as the price goes up, from a dollar standpoint, that goes up as the functional discounts are as a percentage. The third bucket for us is that we do sell our specialty products on a different way than daily trading. We generally provide a monthly pricing. So for our TechShield product, for our top-notch flooring products, we provide a pricing, a flat pricing during a particular month and then adjust that. And so when you're having a rapidly rising market, you don't capture all that. When you have a falling market, then we buy anything. And so you don't give the advantage of it going down.

As we look going forward, we think we have the capacity in place down there to meet most of the needs of the rebuild because that rebuild will occur over a period of years. So the optimism in that is that we will be able to run both of our mills full out, or we expect to, for a number of years based upon that additional demand. Now in the short term, obviously, there was a spike in demand to react to the short-term hit catastrophe-related needs, and we were able to bring some volume over from our Brazilian mill. So a little bit from up here as well. But we think that we pretty well got it covered in terms of ongoing demand with those two mills. The bigger question in terms of longer-term future is as we are able to gain more traction in Brazil, that's a market that's 10x bigger than Chile. And if I had to guess, then that will be, at some point in time, a place that we're going to want to expand our productive capacity."

As Michelle said, I’m Curt Stevens, the CFO and with me today are Rick Frost, LP’s CEO, as well as Mike Kinney, and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
As I usually do, I’ll begin the discussion with the review of the financial results for the quarter. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual business segments and then, selective balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Rick will take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated last quarter’s perspective on the recent operating results, and some thoughts on the outlook for the last quarter of 2010 and looking into 2011.
As we have done in the past, we’ve opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at our external Web site www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation that has supplemental information that should reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will reference these slides as I go through my comments.
We also filed an 8-K this morning, with supplemental information that would be helpful as we discuss the earnings and we will file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon.
I’ll remind all the participants about the forward-looking statement comment that is included on slide two of the presentation. Please also be aware the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information which is included on slide #3.
The appendix attached has some of the necessary reconciliations and that was supplemented by the Form 8-K file that we made earlier this morning. I’m not going to re-read these statements, but I’m incorporating them with this reference.
Slide #4 of the presentation is the discussion of Q3 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We’re reporting today a net loss for the third quarter of $32 million or $0.24 per diluted share.
Net sales from continuing operations were $323 million for the quarter. For the same period last year reported a net loss of $12 million or $0.12 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $311 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $4 million in the quarter compared to $11 million in Q3 of 2009. This is the third quarter in a row positive adjusted EBITDA, despite a housing market that hasn’t improved very much.
Slide #5 of the presentation is the discussion of the special charges in the quarter. The largest as we did record is $17 million other than temporary impairment associated with the anticipated sale of an equity investment of joint venture. What this adjustment did is reduced the carrying value to the estimated sales price.
The other charges in the quarter were largely related to the settlement of the final opt-out associated with the OSB Antitrust Settlement. After we adjust for these, the adjusted loss from operations would be $0.09 per diluted share.
Slide #6 of the presentation is the discussion of year-to-date results compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date we are reporting a net loss of $32 million on net sales of $1.1 billion. Interestingly, at the end of Q3 we had already surpassed the sales levels for the full year of 2009. For the same period last year reported net loss is $72 million on sales of $783 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for year-to-date was a positive $81 million compared to a $25 million loss for the first nine months of last year.
The tax rate on continuing operations for the first nine months was 32% as compared to 40% in the prior year. For 2010, the difference between the 32% and the statutory rate is primarily due to the impact of foreign source income, FX income on certain intercompany loans and an offset due to the non-deductibility of the other than temporary impairment that we took on our equity investments.
Before discussing the performance of each of our segment, let me just take a few minutes to explain at a high level why earnings were down slightly though sales are up modestly. On the sales side, OSB pricing accounted for about $10 million improvement. However, in the cost side, we did have an increase in the per unit cost for raw materials that accounted for a reduction in earnings of about $6 million. The weakening U.S. dollar negatively affected our profits in our Canadian operations by about $3 million.
Finally, and probably more significantly in all of our businesses, we took more production downtime in Q3 of 2010 compared to last year, as we adjusted to reflect lower customer demand due to the anemic building activity that we had over the summer.
Slide #7 of the presentation is a summary of our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $6 million in Q3 of 2009. For the quarter, we had about a 4% increase in volumes at an average sales price that was 9% higher.
As I mentioned just a minute ago, the increase in sales price resulted in a $10 million improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting the increase in pricing was the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and raw materials cost.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was flat at a positive $5 million between the years. Compared to Q2 of 2010, volumes were lower by 6% or price decreased 32%.
Year-to-date in our OSB business, we had operating income of $38 million compared to a loss of $48 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $67 million in 2010 and a loss of $22 million in 2009. Pricing was primarily responsible for improvement, although volumes were higher by 18%.
Slide #8 of the presentation is a summary of our Siding business. This includes our SmartSide and Canexel siding products and commodity OSB produced in Hayward mill. For the third quarter, siding had operating income $9 million, which was lower than the $16 million recorded in the same quarter last year.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $13 million compared to $21 million in Q3 of last year. For the quarter, sales were down 8% with unit volumes lower by 11% in SmartSide and up slightly in Canexel.
During the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 1%, primarily due to product mix with individual product pricing is pretty flat. Canexel price has showed an increase of 10%, but this is largely due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar as we sell most of that product denominated in the Canadian dollar.
On a year-to-date basis, Siding had operating income of $40 million compared to income of $25 million same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $54 million in 2010 and $39 million in 2009. Volume and higher pricing in OSB in Q2 accounted for most of this improvement.
Slide #9 of the presentation is a summary of our Engineered Wood business. This includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber produced at Houlton, Maine and Laminated Veneer Lumber plus some related products. This also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL, produced by the Abitibi JV or under our sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
For Q3, EWP recorded a loss of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the EWP segment was a negative $3 million in both quarters.
Volumes of I-Joist were down significantly 42% and LVL and LSL were down 28% compared to the same quarter last year. These declines, where all tied to the slowing new housing activity that led to significant reductions of inventory in the channel, after inventory increases in the second quarter of 2010.
Pricing was up 15% in I-Joist, 11% in LVL and LSL due to price increases that we implemented across EWP to offset the significant higher raw materials cost, principally OSB, veneer and lumber.
Year-to-date in an operating loss of $16 million compared to loss of $24 million in the same period last year. So, even in a horrible pricing market, we have made quite a bit of improvement in the EWP. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was a loss of $6 million versus $15 million in 2009.
On our other building products, there is no slide for this, but let me make a few comments. Included in this area are South American operations, our molding business, the equity investment in U.S. GreenFiber, and some non-operating facilities. For the quarter, sales were up 52% at $41 million from $27 million recorded last year, primarily driven by our South American operations.
Income in Q3 for both years was about $1 million, while adjusted EBITDA was about $3 million. Improvement in South America was offset by lower molding earnings due to weakness in the retail channel and additional costs associated with non-operating facilities.
On a year-to-date basis, we had operating income of $4.5 million compared to income of $2.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $13 million from $10 million in 2009. Few other items, we did have a small foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to about $1 million gain in the same quarter last year.
Investment income in the quarter was lower than Q3 of 2009, primarily due to the receipt of the $113 million unlimited recourse notes that was paid in the second quarter, and therefore, about $3 million of interest income and conversely interest expense was not earned or accrued in 2010.
Total SG&A costs was down slightly in third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. The reduction was primarily due to cost containment. For general corporate, they were about comparable between the two years.
Slide #10 of the presentation is a summary of the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash of $434 million at the end of the quarter, working capital of about $572 million.
We are in a net cash position at the end of the quarter of $211 million. Capital expenditures for the first nine months were $12 million, offsetting that as we did have refunds from our joint ventures of about $6 million. So, ending book value per share was $9.40.
Couple of things, I want to make a comment on the balance sheet. In mid-August, we did pay off the $61 million remaining on the 2010 notes that matured, so that was paid. Then just in the last few days, we did modify our asset base loan agreement with our banking group to increase the availability, lower our costs and reduce the administrative burden. We will be issuing an 8-K tomorrow that will give you more detail on that.
With that, let me turn it over to Rick.

As Curt said, we do appreciate you listening in on our Q3 calls. It is a cloudless day in Nashville today. I am happy to report that the Titans are off to a 5-3 start, which makes us happy and on a personal note, my alma mater LSU beat Alabama over the weekend, and I wish that business was going just as well.
In my remarks this morning, I want to give you some observations on Q3 2010 by business, discuss some accomplishments with you for the quarter that are not in the release, and then finish up with a forward-looking thoughts.
In our internal recap of Q3, the term we use to describe the overall business activity was lackluster. Market activity across the building products sector fell in the U.S. considerably from Q2 as you know.
Most people draw in a direct correlation with the expiration of home buying credits at the end of April. It seems clear now that business was actually being pulled forward in response to that reasonably arbitrary stimulus.
In our last call at the end of July, we discussed the fact that sales activity dramatically slowed in June and July. August and most of September were also relatively anemic as our customers adjusted inventories downward.
Retail was quite slow, and we did take a lot of manufacturing downtime to stay aligned with our customers’ takeaways and to bring our inventories down in response to that. We did reduce our inventories from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3 by about $17 million and to do that on a falling sales environment required idling a lot of North American manufacturing.
We are proud to report that LP continues to perform against its industry leading safety record. We had an excellent 100 days of Summer Safety initiative this year and ended up Q3 with our lowest total incident rate ever of 0.49. Both our OSB business and our Engineered Wood Products business went the entire 100 days injury free.
During the quarter, we were honored by the National Safety Council to get an Industry Leader Award recognizing the top 5% of its member companies.
As well, our Lean Six Sigma teams continued to drive overall cost containment and improvement at a 6 to 1 return over the cost to support that program, and in this environment of reduced manufacturing activity I think that’s pretty good pace. This is our third full year as an LSS company and we remained pleased with that technology as our continuous improvement vehicle.
In spite of severe market headwinds in Q3, we accomplished over 550 sales wins in the quarter. Remember I have previously defined a win as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer and our exciting products continue to lead this metric.
But to put Q3 into its proper perspective, all of our North American production volumes were lower in Q3 2010 compared to Q3 2009. To make a few comments now about each of our businesses beginning with OSB.
Our OSB business including our Peace Valley mill operated at 66% of what our current effective capacity is. That excludes Chambord and Clarke County, but includes Peace Valley. I did make a mistake with you on the Q2 call, as I gave you an incorrect number saying we ran at an effective capacity of 86%. We actually ran Q2 at 73% and then at 66% in Q3.
Including Chambord and Clarke County, our Q3 percent utilization of OSB capacity was about 53%. While not actually occurring in Q3, the other OSB item of note was our announcement in October to move our OSB trading desk to Nashville over the next few months. As a result, we will permanently close our longstanding administrative office in Conroe, Texas by the end of Q1 2011.
Moving on to Siding, Siding volumes did slide significantly in Q3 in our SmartSide line. Sales were up 8% Q3 to Q3, and volume was up 11%. We now relate this to what appears to have been a Q2 2010 pull-forward and subsequent inventory adjustment by our customers. However, we see or sense nothing affecting our optimism on continued Siding growth trends.
Engineered Wood Products certainly felt the fall-off in housing activity in Q3. Although, we were able to hang on to most of our price increases that we got in the first half of the year, LSL and LVL volume was down 28% in Q3 from Q3 last year and I-Joists’ volume was down 42%.
Q3 to Q3 financials were about the same and I give our Engineered Wood Products’ folks a lot of credit in the year-to-date 2010 versus year-to-date 2009 operating loss improvement. But the fact is, this business segment needs new residential construction starts to get profitable.
South America included in our other reporting segment continues to grow for us. Both Chile and Brazil were profitable in Q3. Both mills in Chile ran full shifting in Q3. Most of the surge in Chile in OSB demand to-date has not actually been for reconstruction from the earthquake, but for immediate repair and shelter needs from that February earthquake.
The new Chilean administration has slowed the reconstruction effort for a while to review how construction contracts are being awarded. We anticipate that both Lautaro and Panguipulli will continue to run full.
Our Brazil mill in Ponta Grossa is running at about half of its capacity now and is improving monthly, as our Brazilian sales team find more ways to penetrate local and export markets with OSB.
During the quarter as Curt said, we did retire about $61 million of debt and we have also improved our net cash position from the beginning of the year from $163 million to $212 million. We spent about $3.5 million of capital during Q3. We are at about $12 million year-to-date and I expect to come in for the year at less than $20 million.
Looking forward at Q4 and early into next year, I would describe it as not a pretty picture. Forecast consensus is currently that starts for 2010 are going to sugar out about 600,000 to 610,000 all-in, and that includes a further slowing in November, I would think a very anemic December, as we slip into our normal seasonal slowing.
We saw orders in our Siding business pick backup in October. OSB pricing got a little bump early in October, but appears to be sliding slowly now as we slip in under the influence of seasonal effects, and I expect December to be quite slow for housing. I also expect that our customers will be doing all that they can to be very lean of inventory by the end of the year.
So at this time, I expect January and February to also be slow. It’s hard to make a bet whether our customers will take any kind of pre-spring inventory position in March. We are putting in a few more logs into our wood-yards to hedge against this possibility.
On CapEx, the pre-guidance that I will give you to our CapEx for 2011 is about $35 million on our facilities and then another $20 million or so to complete the Ponta Grossa mill purchase in Brazil, and I will firm that up with you on the next call.
Finally, we are in the process of developing our operating plans for 2011. Our underlying assumption is for 700,000 new starts all-in for next year. It’s not a big improvement, but at least it’s some. Consensus for 2012 is currently around a million starts, which we would certainly welcome, but are not betting on at this point in time.
Our year-to-date 2010 versus 2009 comparisons reflect quite favorably and reinforce the fact that our operating folks are being very thrifty with the buck, and that our sales and marketing folks are getting what they can out of this market.
That said I’ll turn it back over to Curt for questions.
