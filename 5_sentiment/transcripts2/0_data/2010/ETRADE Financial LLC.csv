I'm pleased to be participating in my first call as E*TRADE's new Chairman and also as interim CEO. During my nearly two years as a Board member, I work closely with Don Layton and the entire leadership team at E*TRADE. So from my perspective, it has been a very smooth transition, and I'm happy to be working more closely with the organization during this interim period. The knowledge I pick up while acting as CEO will be helpful to me, and hopefully, to the entire company in my ongoing role as Chairman. During today's call, I will discuss a number of 2009 highlight and key issues, and then turn it over to Bruce, who will provide a financial overview for the quarter and year. From there, I will share our outlook on 2010, and then we will open up the call for questions.Like many companies, E*TRADE began 2009 in unchartered waters. While our core franchise, the Online Brokerage business was strong, we continue to be weighed down by unsettled markets, a very weak global economy and our own asset quality issues. By executing on a number of key initiatives though, we ended the year with a much stronger company, positioned for sustainable profitable growth, supported by a stronger balance sheet and capital structure. While significant time and energy were devoted to our recapitalization efforts during the year, we stayed focused on the Online Brokerage business, enabling us to gain market share from traditional brokers, while competing effectively against our online competitors. During 2009, we recorded our highest DART level in history and added more than 115,000 net new brokerage accounts. We ended the year with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts and saw both brokerage cash and margin receivables increase during the period. If we exclude the loan loss provision and any gains or losses on securities, our operating profit increased 8% when compared with 2008.Our success during the year was supported by continued investments in our Online Brokerage business, specifically product and service enhancements to address the needs of both active traders and long-term investors. This was a high priority for us. We did not want to succeed in recapitalizing the company and find their core business franchise had been eroded. We delivered several new investor offerings including; an IRA-converted tool to support customers through the rules governing 2010 broad conversions; an enhanced investor resource center to simplify access to our comprehensive offerings; an expanded fixed income offering to broaden our product base and appeal to a wider group of investors; and E*TRADE Mobile Pro for iPhone, where we are seeing adoption across all consumer segments as investors increase their reliance on mobile devices for information and transactions.We also launched a number of new initiatives in customer service that have helped drive a greater level of customer satisfaction and contributed to a decline in our annual brokerage account attrition, from 16.7% in 2008 to 13.5% in 2009. We are further sharpening our focus on the products and services that we believe are key to attracting, retaining and extending relationships with the long-term investors, will be an important segment in driving our future growth. In essence, we're focused on four objectives as our business evolves: One, grow our valuable active trader franchise; two, deepen our penetration in the long-term Investors segment; three, increase the quality of the customer accounts; and four, further reduce our attrition rate, the key to continued sustainable growth in brokerage accounts.We made great progress during the year in reducing exposure in our loan portfolios, shrinking total loans by more 5.3 billion including 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. We have reached an inflection point where our provision for loan losses cross below the level of net charge-offs, and we recorded our fifth straight quarterly decline in provisions. Finally, as I alluded to earlier, we were able to execute a very significant recapitalization. We were 765 million of cash equity, investing most of the 733 million of net proceeds in the bank, materially improving our key ratios in liquidity. We also executed a debt exchange of interest-bearing debt to non-interest-bearing convertible debt, reducing our annual corporate interest payments by more than half and deferring any material debt maturities until 2013. This greatly enhanced financial structure, has allowed us to further shift our focus and resources from our repairing balance sheet to building on our core strengths and provides the flexibility we need to execute against our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to discuss our financial performance."

During the quarter, we had a net loss of 67 million or $0.04 per share compared with a net loss of 276 million or $0.50 per share a year ago.

During the quarter, we had a net loss of 67 million or $0.04 per share compared with a net loss of 276 million or $0.50 per share a year ago. For the full year, we reported a net loss of 1.3 billion or $1.18 per share. Excluding the one-time, non-cash charge associated with our debt exchange, our net loss for the year would have been 525 million or $0.47 per share, and this compares with a full year 2008 loss of 809 million or $1.58 per share from continuing operations.During the quarter, we generated 523 million of net revenue, which compares with 575 million in the third quarter and represents an 8% increase from 486 million in the same quarter a year ago. Our reported revenue included net interest income of 321 million, which was essentially flat from last quarter. This reflected a net interest spread of 2.86% on average interest earning assets of 43.8 billion. So while we saw a 459 million decline in average interest-earning assets during the quarter, this was offset by a four basis-point expansion in the interest income spread. We continue to be pleased that we have been able to maintain this level of interest rate spread despite the low level of market interest rates.Commission, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the fourth quarter were 205 million. This was an 11% sequential decline compared to the third quarter, which reflected the lower trading activity, as well as a $0.19 decline in average commission per trade due to a less favorable customer mix. Our total operating expense for the quarter rose 17 million to 318 million. The increase was primarily due to 14 million in charges associated with the restructuring of our international operations, as well as a seasonal increase in advertising and higher real estate owned expenses.For the full year, our operating expense declined 4%, as we benefited from prudent expense management while investing appropriately for long-term growth. I should also note that if we exclude the premiums for FDI insurance, our operating expense declined by 9% from the prior year. For the full year 2009, we achieved record DARTs of 197,000 and added 115,000 net new brokerage accounts, ending the year with 2.7 million brokerage accounts. Brokerage customer cash increased by 4.7 billion in 2009 to nearly 21 billion, and margin receivables were up 37% to; 3.8 billion compared to a year ago.Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, DARTs were 174,000, down 12% sequentially due to seasonality and lower market volatility, and off 20% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, one of the most volatile market periods in history. We experienced a slight decline in brokerage accounts during the quarter, down 17,000 accounts, with about half of this decline due to our exit from local market trading in Germany. We believe that the rest of the decline can be largely explained by the attrition of less seasoned accounts that were acquired at the peak of market volatility when we saw an unprecedented surge in new account activity. Also, we believe that the lower market volatility during the fourth quarter caused a slowdown in the new account additions, since we typically see a strong correlation between new accounts and the volatility index.Although net new customer assets were a negative 300 million during the quarter, net asset flows into our U.S. Brokerage business were a positive 1.5 billion. And while our balance sheet reduction strategy drove a decrease in savings deposits, brokerage cash increased by 600 million during the quarter, even as our customers were net buyers of 800 million of securities. While the majority of our restructuring in the U.S. is well behind us, we have some additional work in our International business to ensure we are focused only on opportunities where we can truly add value and achieve consistent profitability. We will continue to offer cross-border trade, where customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in U.S. securities. But we are exiting the local market trading business where our customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in non-US securities.During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our local German operation, and we expect to divest our local Nordic and U.K. businesses in the first half of this year. As a result, we expect to record additional restructuring charges, which we currently estimate to be around 15 million during the first half of 2010. The strategic redirection will improve operating margins in our International business and lead to higher levels of profitability.Turning to the balance sheet, over the course of the year, we made significant progress in our loan portfolio. Our loan loss provision declined from 347 million in the third quarter to 292 million in the fourth quarter. Total net charge-offs in the quarter were 324 million, a decrease of 27 million from the prior quarter. We also delivered improved performance as measured by special mention and at-risk delinquencies, with year-over-year total special mention delinquencies declining by 22% and total at-risk delinquencies declining by 13%. Sequentially, the decreases were 3% and 2%, respectively.Our quarterly loan loss provision has declined 44% from its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Our loan loss allowance has stabilized at 1.2 billion and is now 6% of total loans. The loan loss allowance includes a reserve against modified loans of 193 million or 16% of the total allowance to reflect the accounting for troubled debt restructurings. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our loan modification program is having on our credit exposure and comfortable with our provisioning, as the level of re-delinquency continues to be favorable to industry expectations.We also ended the year in a strong capital position with our bank capital ratios substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. As of December 31, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.7% to total adjusted assets and 12.8% to risk-weighted assets. We also had 899 million of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators defined as well-capitalized. We ended the year with 393 million in corporate cash, a decline of approximately 100 million from the prior quarter. As we discussed in our third quarter earnings call, this is due primarily to the transfer of 91 million from the parent company to the bank for a tax refund related to the sale of our Canadian subsidiary in 2008. And speaking of taxes, I want to call your attention to a $23 million adjustment that we have made in our tax provision for the third quarter. This adjustment is described in the supplemental information in our press release.In summary, we have made significant progress this year on our financial performance, our capital position and our risk profile. With a healthier balance sheet in place, we have entered 2010 with a clear focus on initiatives that will help drive the growth in our core Brokerage business. And with that, I will turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

Before opening up the call for questions, let me share our outlook for 2010. While it's always difficult to predict market conditions, for planning purposes, we anticipate customer activity levels similar to what we saw in 2009. We also expect that we will have lower interest earning assets as we continue to shrink the bank's balance sheet. This should largely be offset by an improvement in our net interest spread and reflects our assumptions that short-term interest rates will continue to stay low for most, if not all of 2010. We anticipate that credit trends we saw in 2009 to continue in 2010, and we expect the bank to reach a capital break-even point in 2010 we are generating rather than using regulatory risk-weighted capital.This year, we plan to increase our investment in the Brokerage business, with an eye toward providing an expanded suite of product in tools and an enhanced service capability in order to attract and retain quality brokerage accounts. To this end, E*TRADE customers will soon have access to high-quality active portfolio management service resources with a competitive advisory fees structure and an accessible entry point of $25,000. Initial customer interest in this managed investment portfolio has been strong, and we look forward to building on this momentum as we roll the product out more broadly. We expect operating expenses and headcount to decline modestly this year, with net increases in our customer facing in technology spend and a net decrease in administrative and overhead cost. We'll also have a continued commitment to our advertising and marketing programs, which are budgeted to remain consistent with our 2009 spend.Through my 10 years as a Director, I've been impressed with the strength of the E*TRADE organization and the vibrancy of its Brokerage business. The loyalty of the customer base during some extremely challenging times was a testament to the team and the franchise. Now after almost one month as interim CEO, I'm confident that we have a solid foundation and the right senior management team to drive the company's success. We're making meaningful progress in bringing on board our next CEO to lead the company forward. In the meantime, I assure you that I am fully engaged and actively involved to make certain that we take advantage of the strong momentum we enjoyed going into 2010. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Number one, we've seen -- as you can see in our release, very steady improvement in delinquency experience over the course of 2009 in both our home equity and first lien portfolios. And that's being driven by the overriding factor, which is our portfolio, is much more seasoned than our competitors. Our last purchases were in 2007 and since that time, we have a liquidating portfolio.

We want to reach out a little bit more into our long-term investor base, broaden that out, attract a different kind of client in addition to what we already have, reduce the churn on the other end because there's enormous amount of account that come in here and then leave. And some of the reduction actually that you see in the accounts for this quarter, are because of a relatively small fee that got imposed, and had the effect of driving accounts below the minimum that we consider our threshold for counting somewhere as an active account. So we to move away from that. it will be an evolutionary process and I think as we go further down that path, you'll start to see more stability in both account opening and closing, as well as net new asset generation."

I'm pleased to be participating in my first call as E*TRADE's new Chairman and also as interim CEO. During my nearly two years as a Board member, I work closely with Don Layton and the entire leadership team at E*TRADE. So from my perspective, it has been a very smooth transition, and I'm happy to be working more closely with the organization during this interim period. The knowledge I pick up while acting as CEO will be helpful to me, and hopefully, to the entire company in my ongoing role as Chairman. During today's call, I will discuss a number of 2009 highlight and key issues, and then turn it over to Bruce, who will provide a financial overview for the quarter and year. From there, I will share our outlook on 2010, and then we will open up the call for questions.Like many companies, E*TRADE began 2009 in unchartered waters. While our core franchise, the Online Brokerage business was strong, we continue to be weighed down by unsettled markets, a very weak global economy and our own asset quality issues. By executing on a number of key initiatives though, we ended the year with a much stronger company, positioned for sustainable profitable growth, supported by a stronger balance sheet and capital structure. While significant time and energy were devoted to our recapitalization efforts during the year, we stayed focused on the Online Brokerage business, enabling us to gain market share from traditional brokers, while competing effectively against our online competitors. During 2009, we recorded our highest DART level in history and added more than 115,000 net new brokerage accounts. We ended the year with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts and saw both brokerage cash and margin receivables increase during the period. If we exclude the loan loss provision and any gains or losses on securities, our operating profit increased 8% when compared with 2008.Our success during the year was supported by continued investments in our Online Brokerage business, specifically product and service enhancements to address the needs of both active traders and long-term investors. This was a high priority for us. We did not want to succeed in recapitalizing the company and find their core business franchise had been eroded. We delivered several new investor offerings including; an IRA-converted tool to support customers through the rules governing 2010 broad conversions; an enhanced investor resource center to simplify access to our comprehensive offerings; an expanded fixed income offering to broaden our product base and appeal to a wider group of investors; and E*TRADE Mobile Pro for iPhone, where we are seeing adoption across all consumer segments as investors increase their reliance on mobile devices for information and transactions.We also launched a number of new initiatives in customer service that have helped drive a greater level of customer satisfaction and contributed to a decline in our annual brokerage account attrition, from 16.7% in 2008 to 13.5% in 2009. We are further sharpening our focus on the products and services that we believe are key to attracting, retaining and extending relationships with the long-term investors, will be an important segment in driving our future growth. In essence, we're focused on four objectives as our business evolves: One, grow our valuable active trader franchise; two, deepen our penetration in the long-term Investors segment; three, increase the quality of the customer accounts; and four, further reduce our attrition rate, the key to continued sustainable growth in brokerage accounts.We made great progress during the year in reducing exposure in our loan portfolios, shrinking total loans by more 5.3 billion including 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. We have reached an inflection point where our provision for loan losses cross below the level of net charge-offs, and we recorded our fifth straight quarterly decline in provisions. Finally, as I alluded to earlier, we were able to execute a very significant recapitalization. We were 765 million of cash equity, investing most of the 733 million of net proceeds in the bank, materially improving our key ratios in liquidity. We also executed a debt exchange of interest-bearing debt to non-interest-bearing convertible debt, reducing our annual corporate interest payments by more than half and deferring any material debt maturities until 2013. This greatly enhanced financial structure, has allowed us to further shift our focus and resources from our repairing balance sheet to building on our core strengths and provides the flexibility we need to execute against our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to discuss our financial performance."

During the quarter, we had a net loss of 67 million or $0.04 per share compared with a net loss of 276 million or $0.50 per share a year ago. For the full year, we reported a net loss of 1.3 billion or $1.18 per share. Excluding the one-time, non-cash charge associated with our debt exchange, our net loss for the year would have been 525 million or $0.47 per share, and this compares with a full year 2008 loss of 809 million or $1.58 per share from continuing operations.During the quarter, we generated 523 million of net revenue, which compares with 575 million in the third quarter and represents an 8% increase from 486 million in the same quarter a year ago. Our reported revenue included net interest income of 321 million, which was essentially flat from last quarter. This reflected a net interest spread of 2.86% on average interest earning assets of 43.8 billion. So while we saw a 459 million decline in average interest-earning assets during the quarter, this was offset by a four basis-point expansion in the interest income spread. We continue to be pleased that we have been able to maintain this level of interest rate spread despite the low level of market interest rates.Commission, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the fourth quarter were 205 million. This was an 11% sequential decline compared to the third quarter, which reflected the lower trading activity, as well as a $0.19 decline in average commission per trade due to a less favorable customer mix. Our total operating expense for the quarter rose 17 million to 318 million. The increase was primarily due to 14 million in charges associated with the restructuring of our international operations, as well as a seasonal increase in advertising and higher real estate owned expenses.For the full year, our operating expense declined 4%, as we benefited from prudent expense management while investing appropriately for long-term growth. I should also note that if we exclude the premiums for FDI insurance, our operating expense declined by 9% from the prior year. For the full year 2009, we achieved record DARTs of 197,000 and added 115,000 net new brokerage accounts, ending the year with 2.7 million brokerage accounts. Brokerage customer cash increased by 4.7 billion in 2009 to nearly 21 billion, and margin receivables were up 37% to; 3.8 billion compared to a year ago.Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, DARTs were 174,000, down 12% sequentially due to seasonality and lower market volatility, and off 20% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, one of the most volatile market periods in history. We experienced a slight decline in brokerage accounts during the quarter, down 17,000 accounts, with about half of this decline due to our exit from local market trading in Germany. We believe that the rest of the decline can be largely explained by the attrition of less seasoned accounts that were acquired at the peak of market volatility when we saw an unprecedented surge in new account activity. Also, we believe that the lower market volatility during the fourth quarter caused a slowdown in the new account additions, since we typically see a strong correlation between new accounts and the volatility index.Although net new customer assets were a negative 300 million during the quarter, net asset flows into our U.S. Brokerage business were a positive 1.5 billion. And while our balance sheet reduction strategy drove a decrease in savings deposits, brokerage cash increased by 600 million during the quarter, even as our customers were net buyers of 800 million of securities. While the majority of our restructuring in the U.S. is well behind us, we have some additional work in our International business to ensure we are focused only on opportunities where we can truly add value and achieve consistent profitability. We will continue to offer cross-border trade, where customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in U.S. securities. But we are exiting the local market trading business where our customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in non-US securities.During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our local German operation, and we expect to divest our local Nordic and U.K. businesses in the first half of this year. As a result, we expect to record additional restructuring charges, which we currently estimate to be around 15 million during the first half of 2010. The strategic redirection will improve operating margins in our International business and lead to higher levels of profitability.Turning to the balance sheet, over the course of the year, we made significant progress in our loan portfolio. Our loan loss provision declined from 347 million in the third quarter to 292 million in the fourth quarter. Total net charge-offs in the quarter were 324 million, a decrease of 27 million from the prior quarter. We also delivered improved performance as measured by special mention and at-risk delinquencies, with year-over-year total special mention delinquencies declining by 22% and total at-risk delinquencies declining by 13%. Sequentially, the decreases were 3% and 2%, respectively.Our quarterly loan loss provision has declined 44% from its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Our loan loss allowance has stabilized at 1.2 billion and is now 6% of total loans. The loan loss allowance includes a reserve against modified loans of 193 million or 16% of the total allowance to reflect the accounting for troubled debt restructurings. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our loan modification program is having on our credit exposure and comfortable with our provisioning, as the level of re-delinquency continues to be favorable to industry expectations.We also ended the year in a strong capital position with our bank capital ratios substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. As of December 31, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.7% to total adjusted assets and 12.8% to risk-weighted assets. We also had 899 million of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators defined as well-capitalized. We ended the year with 393 million in corporate cash, a decline of approximately 100 million from the prior quarter. As we discussed in our third quarter earnings call, this is due primarily to the transfer of 91 million from the parent company to the bank for a tax refund related to the sale of our Canadian subsidiary in 2008. And speaking of taxes, I want to call your attention to a $23 million adjustment that we have made in our tax provision for the third quarter. This adjustment is described in the supplemental information in our press release.In summary, we have made significant progress this year on our financial performance, our capital position and our risk profile. With a healthier balance sheet in place, we have entered 2010 with a clear focus on initiatives that will help drive the growth in our core Brokerage business. And with that, I will turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

Before opening up the call for questions, let me share our outlook for 2010. While it's always difficult to predict market conditions, for planning purposes, we anticipate customer activity levels similar to what we saw in 2009. We also expect that we will have lower interest earning assets as we continue to shrink the bank's balance sheet. This should largely be offset by an improvement in our net interest spread and reflects our assumptions that short-term interest rates will continue to stay low for most, if not all of 2010. We anticipate that credit trends we saw in 2009 to continue in 2010, and we expect the bank to reach a capital break-even point in 2010 we are generating rather than using regulatory risk-weighted capital.This year, we plan to increase our investment in the Brokerage business, with an eye toward providing an expanded suite of product in tools and an enhanced service capability in order to attract and retain quality brokerage accounts. To this end, E*TRADE customers will soon have access to high-quality active portfolio management service resources with a competitive advisory fees structure and an accessible entry point of $25,000. Initial customer interest in this managed investment portfolio has been strong, and we look forward to building on this momentum as we roll the product out more broadly. We expect operating expenses and headcount to decline modestly this year, with net increases in our customer facing in technology spend and a net decrease in administrative and overhead cost. We'll also have a continued commitment to our advertising and marketing programs, which are budgeted to remain consistent with our 2009 spend.Through my 10 years as a Director, I've been impressed with the strength of the E*TRADE organization and the vibrancy of its Brokerage business. The loyalty of the customer base during some extremely challenging times was a testament to the team and the franchise. Now after almost one month as interim CEO, I'm confident that we have a solid foundation and the right senior management team to drive the company's success. We're making meaningful progress in bringing on board our next CEO to lead the company forward. In the meantime, I assure you that I am fully engaged and actively involved to make certain that we take advantage of the strong momentum we enjoyed going into 2010.

We want to reach out a little bit more into our long-term investor base, broaden that out, attract a different kind of client in addition to what we already have, reduce the churn on the other end because there's enormous amount of account that come in here and then leave.

We are going through what I would call some logistical issues, and our intention is to have an announcement in the near future. Now if you ask me what characteristics are important, I would tell you it's someone with a relatively long horizon. We're not looking for someone to come in for a year or two. It's someone who's got to have a strong background in financial services, someone who is very comfortable with technology and have some technology of substance in their background and someone who understands retail financial services in particular. Those are the kind of characteristics we are looking for. I would tell you too, that we have seen enormously attractive candidates."

I am pleased to be participating in my first call as E*TRADE’s Chief Executive Officer. To begin today’s call, I would like to share a few thoughts and then Bruce will take you through the first quarter results. From there, I will add a few closing comments, before we take your questions.
I have had a very busy and exciting first few weeks at E*TRADE, learning more about the company, our people, and our customers. This a pivotal time for the company and I am energized by the opportunity to lead the organization to its next phase of growth and innovation. My predecessors, Bob Druskin and Don Layton, the senior management team and really the entire organization navigated the company through very challenging times, and today, with a solid brokerage business, complemented by an improving balance sheet and a strength in capital structure, E*TRADE is well positioned for growth and profitability.
I was attracted to the CEO role at E*TRADE for a number of reasons. I am a builder of businesses, and I look forward to working with the team to build on the company’s current momentum. In addition, I believe E*TRADE’s focus on expanding customer relationships, both with active traders and long-term investors aligns well with my experience in building consumer franchises through enhanced value propositions, customer segmentation, product innovation, and world-class customer service.
E*TRADE remains a respected company with a powerful financial services brand, and as I spend time with our company and our people, I am even more confident about E*TRADE’s opportunity to reach its full potential, and I look forward to engaging with you on our progress. As Bruce will describe E*TRADE’s first quarter performance, exhibit several positive trends, earnings are headed in the right direction, our retail brokerage business continues to compete effectively, balanced levels in our loan portfolio declined at a consistent rate with improving delinquency metrics, and for the first time in two years, E*TRADE Bank internally generated rather than used capital.
These trends provide us with the flexibility to make investments that will drive our continued leadership as a trading and investing platform and our ongoing expansion in the long-term investor segment.
And with that brief introduction, I will turn the call over to Bruce.

We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our finan",1490,"Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our financial results, I will review a few highlights of the quarter.
On the product side, a number of new customer offerings or enhancements were introduced. For long-term investors, E*TRADE capital management introduced managed investment portfolios, with a competitive fee structure and an accessible entry point of only $25,000. And Power E*TRADE Pro users now have access to an expanded feature set, including streaming CNBC broadcast.
In addition, E*TRADE Mobile Pro for the new iPad was recently released, and we are proud that Apple highlighted our application on its download site and during its media briefings throughout the launch. We continue to lead the industry with tools that support today’s increasingly mobile investor.
During the quarter, we also simplified our fee structure to enhance our value proposition to customers. We eliminated the $12.99 pricing tier as well as incremental commissions that apply to certain trades. And effective in the second quarter, we are eliminating all of our account inactivity fees. We expect that these changes will reduce our revenue by approximately $50 million in 2010, but view the changes as an investment in customer satisfaction that we believe will reduce attrition rates over the long term.
We were gratified that Barrons recognized our comprehensive customer experience in its 2010 annual online brokerage survey. Barrons awarded E*TRADE Securities four out of five stars, described this as a one-stop shopping destination, highlighted our mobile trading technology, and listed us among the best firms for long-term investing.
Turning to our financial results, the company had a net loss of $48 million, or $0.02 per share during the quarter, which compares with a net loss of $67 million or $0.04 per share in the prior quarter, and a loss of $233 million, or $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we generated $537 million of net revenue, which is an increase of $13 million from the prior quarter, and an increase of $39 million or 8% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our revenue this quarter included net interest income of $320 million, which was essentially flat compared with last quarter. This reflected a net interest spread of 2.96% on average interest-earning assets of $42.4 billion. Therefore, while average interest-earning assets declined by $1.4 billion, a 10 basis points expansion in the interest income spread allowed us to maintain a consistent level of net interest income.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the first quarter were $196 million. This was a 5% sequential decline compared with the fourth quarter, which reflected lower retail trading activity as well as a $0.10 decline in the average commission per trade. The decline in the average commission included the impact of our recent pricing changes, which was partially offset by a more favorable customer mix this quarter. We enjoyed increased principal transactions this quarter in our market making business. They were up $3 million from the prior quarter and $9 million from the prior year.
Our revenue this quarter also included $29 million of net gains on loans and securities. This net gain was greater than $9 million of impairments during the quarter. Our total operating expense for the first quarter declined from the prior quarter by $23 million to $295 million. This included lower compensation, real estate-owned bad debt and restructuring expenses, which more than offset higher seasonal spending for advertising and market development. Our operating expense declined 4% compared with the first quarter of 2009, if we exclude FDIC insurance premiums and restructuring activities during both periods.
We are well on the way toward completing our previously announced plan to restructure our international operations. We are exiting local market trading operations, but will continue to offer customers residing outside of the US the ability to trade in US securities. We completed the sale of our German operation at the end of last year, and in April, we consummated the sales of our local Nordic and UK businesses.
During the quarter, we recorded $3.4 million in international restructuring charges. Over the next two quarters, we expect to record approximately $1 million in restructuring charges, including a $3 million credit during the second quarter and a $4 million charge during the third quarter. The restructuring charges are lower than previously expected, due to a gain on the sale of the UK business and lower-than-anticipated costs. With our restructuring largely completed, we will focus on US metrics going forward, as the international local activity will be phasing out over the next few quarters.
DARTs for our US operations were 155,000 during the first quarter, which is down 2% from the prior quarter, and 11% compared with the first quarter of 2009, a period of significant market volatility. Brokerage accounts were up 2,000 and we ended the quarter with 2.6 million accounts. Net new asset flows into our US brokerage business were a positive $2.2 billion during the quarter. Therefore while the total number of brokerage accounts remained relatively constant, we believe the generation of net new assets indicates higher quality customer accounts.
Customer assets in the US were $159 billion at quarter-end. Net new assets were a positive $400 million during the quarter, with the increase in brokerage assets more than offsetting the planned decline in customer bank assets. Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.4 billion to $21.8 billion, while bank customer cash declined by $1.8 billion, including the sale of approximately $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover. Customer margin receivables in the US grew by 5% during the quarter and ended at $3.8 billion. This represented a 67% increase from a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made continued progress in the run-off of our loan portfolio, with total loans declining by $1 billion during the quarter. Our loan loss provision declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, from $292 million in the prior quarter to $268 million this quarter. Net charge-offs were $288 million, which was a $36 million decrease from the prior quarter. Because our provision was less than our charge-offs this quarter, our loan loss allowance declined by $20 million. Our loan loss reserve continues to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is equal to 6% of total loans.
Delinquency trends continued to improve, with quarter-over-quarter total special mention delinquencies declining by 4% and total at-risk delinquencies declining by 8%. We continued to be pleased with the impact that our loan modification program is having on our credit exposure and comfortable with our provision. As Steve highlighted earlier, we were extremely pleased that the Bank generated $48 million in regulatory risk-based capital during the quarter. And while we may not generate capital in every quarter, we do expect that the Bank will generate capital for the full year 2010, marking a key milestone in our return to financial strength.
Our bank capital ratios continue to be substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. As of March 31, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.83% to total adjusted assets and 13.08% to risk-weighted assets. Our sale of the savings accounts in particular allowed us to free up approximately $50 million in Tier 1 capital. We also ended the quarter with $947 million of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators define as well capitalized.
We ended the quarter with $418 million in corporate cash, an increase of approximately $25 million from the prior quarter. We expect to receive during the second and third quarter a tax refund of approximately $100 million related to the legislation in 2009 that extended net operating loss carry-backs to five years. We expect that the parent company will retain $95 million of this cash, with the remaining $5 million going to the bank. Given our improving financial position, we plan to pay cash for the May coupon on our springing lien notes, although we will consider this decision more specifically as we approach the interest payment date.
Finally, I would like to highlight a change that we are making in our financial reporting this quarter. In addition to the trading and investing and the balance sheet management segments, we are now providing increased visibility into our corporate expenses with the introduction of a new corporate segment. This new corporate segment includes unallocated expenses for finance, legal, human resource and risk management functions as well as corporate interest expense.
In summary, we believe that our first quarter results demonstrate the strength in our core retail franchise and continued improvement in our overall financial condition. We welcome Steve to the organization and look forward to his leadership as we focus on growth and profitability.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks.

I welcome this challenge and I am certain that the rest of our management team does too.
And although it is still early days for me, I have several thoughts about E*TRADE’s future. These include that we build on our heritage and strength as a technology leader to develop and/or embrace the next set of disruptive innovations; further leverage rapidly evolving research segmentation and decision science tools to drive more effective customer acquisition and retention and to expand customer relationships, particularly in the long-term investor segment; enhance our product suite and customer interaction models to better serve our active trader and long-term investor segments; and continue to support our brand and extend it more fully.
Not surprisingly, these themes support our strategy to extend our leadership in the active trader segment, while continuing to expand our relationships with long-term investors. I look forward to the coming weeks and months as we develop and execute plans for E*TRADE’s next stage of growth. And as I said earlier, I look forward to engaging with you on our progress.

Since we now have returned to a much more normal level of home equity of loans, we expect that to affect, in effect to dissolve over the next quarter or two.

So, that’s really where you see in the growth, especially in both imports, but we have also seen a nice list within the NMS businesses well, and we feel that trend will continue as long as market conditions are the way they are, and they could even increase if we get more volatility. So, we are very excited about that business.

We do agree the trends in the home equity portfolio, been favorable in the first lien, but first lien also has declined quite consistently over the past 12 months at a slower pace than home equity, because as we have mentioned before, it’s a less seasoned portfolio, and furthermore we have first mortgages with relatively low LTVs and it’s taken a longer time for some of those to become delinquent. Having said that, we would expect that the possible trend to continue perhaps at this more moderate pace that we have seen over the past few months. But to the point it was mentioned before, in the quarter, sort of the special-mentioned delinquencies were more or less flat, but there were improvements in the roll rates in the categories, and actually we did see more significant declines in the later-stage buckets. So, again, we won’t predict when exactly that means that we would flip, but we are pretty confident that’s coming not too far away.

To begin today's call, I would like to share a few thoughts, and then Bruce will take you through the first quarter results. From there, I will add a few closing comments before we take your questions.
I have had a very busy and exciting first few weeks at E*TRADE, learning more about the company, our people and our customers. This is a pivotal time for the company, and I am energized by the opportunity to lead the organization to its next phase of growth and innovation. My predecessors, Bob Druskin and Don Layton, the senior management team and really, the entire organization, navigated the company through very challenging times. And today, with a solid brokerage business, complemented by an improving balance sheet and its strength in capital structure, E*TRADE is well-positioned for growth and profitability.
I was attracted to the CEO role at E*TRADE for a number of reasons. I am a builder of businesses, and I look forward to working with a team to build on build on the company's current momentum. In addition, I believe E*TRADE's focus on expanding customer relationships, both with active traders and long-term investors, aligns well with my experience in building consumer franchises, through enhanced value propositions, customer segmentation, product innovation and world-class customer service.  E*TRADE remains a respected company with a powerful financial services brand. And as I spend time with our company and our people, I am even more confident about E*TRADE's opportunity to reach its full potential. And I look forward to engaging with you on our progress.
As Bruce will describe, E*TRADE's first quarter performance exhibits several positive trends. Earnings are headed in the right direction, our retail brokerage business continues to compete effectively, balanced levels in our loan portfolio declined at a consistent rate with improving delinquency metrics, and for the first time in two years, E*TRADE Bank internally generated rather than used capital. These trends provide us with the flexibility to make investments that will drive our continued leadership as a trading and investing platform and our ongoing expansion in the long term Investor segment. 
And with that brief introduction, I will turn the call over to Bruce."

We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance, and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our fina",1494,"Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance, and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our financial results, I will review a few highlights of the quarter. 
On the product side, a number of new customer offerings and enhancements were introduced. For long-term investors, E*TRADE Capital Management introduced Managed Investment Portfolios with a competitive fee structure and an accessible entry point of only $25,000. And Power E*TRADE Pro users now have access to an expanded feature set, including streaming CNBC broadcast. In addition, E*TRADE Mobile Pro for the new iPad was recently released and we are proud that Apple highlighted our application on its download site, and during its media briefings throughout the launch. We continue to lead the industry with tools that support today's increasingly mobile investor.
During the quarter, we also simplified our fee structure to enhance our value proposition to customers. We eliminated the $12.99 pricing tier, as well as incremental commissions that apply to certain trades. And effective in the second quarter, we are eliminating all of our account inactivity fees. We expect that these changes will reduce our revenue by approximately $50 million in 2010 but view the changes as an investment in customer satisfaction, that we believe will reduce attrition rates over the long term. We were gratified that Barron's recognized our comprehensive customer experience in its 2010 annual Online Brokers Survey. Barron's awarded E*TRADE Securities four out of five stars, described us as a one-stop shopping destination, highlighted our mobile trading technology and listed us among the best firms for long-term investing.
Turning to our financial results, the company had a net loss of $48 million or $0.02 per share during the quarter, which compares with a net loss of $67 million or $0.04 per share in the prior quarter, and a loss of $233 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we generated $537 million of net revenue, which is an increase of $13 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $39 million or 8% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue this quarter included net interest income of $320 million, which was essentially flat compared with last quarter. This reflected a net interest spread of 2.96% on average interest-earning assets of $42.4 billion. Therefore, while average interest-earning assets declined by $1.4 billion, a 10 basis point expansion in interest income spread allowed us to maintain a consistent level of net interest income.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the first quarter were $196 million. This was a 5% sequential decline compared with the fourth quarter, which reflected lower retail trading activity as well as a $0.10 decline in the average commission per trade. The decline in the average commission included the impact of our recent pricing changes, which was partially offset by a more favorable customer mix this quarter.
We enjoyed increased principal transactions this quarter in our Market Making business. They were up $3 million from the prior quarter and $9 million from the prior year. Our revenue this quarter also included $29 million of net gains on loans and securities. This net gain was greater than the $9 million of impairments during the quarter. 
Our total operating expense for the first quarter declined from the prior quarter by $23 million to $295 million. This included lower compensation, real estate owned bad debt and restructuring expenses, which more than offset higher seasonal spending for advertising and market development. Our operating expense declined 4% compared with the first quarter of 2009 if we exclude FDIC insurance premiums and restructuring activities during both periods. 
We are well on the way toward completing our previously announced plan to restructure our international operations. We are exiting local market trading operations but will continue to offer customers residing outside of the U.S. the ability to trade in U.S. securities. We completed the sale of our German operation at the end of last year, and in April, we consummated the sales of our local Nordic and U.K. businesses.
During the quarter, we recorded $3.4 million in international restructuring charges. Over the next two quarters, we expect to record approximately $1 million in restructuring charges, including a $3 million credit during the second quarter and a $4 million charge during the third quarter. The restructuring charges are lower than previously expected due to a gain on the sale of the U.K. business and lower than anticipated costs. With our restructuring largely completed, we will focus on U.S. metrics going forward as the international local activity will be phasing out over the next few quarters.
DARTs for our U.S. operations were 155,000 during the first quarter, which is down 2% from the prior quarter and 11% compared with the first quarter of 2009, a period of significant market volatility. Brokerage accounts were up 2,000 and we ended the quarter with 2.6 million accounts. Net new assets flows into our U.S. Brokerage business were a positive $2.2 billion during the quarter. Therefore, while the total number of brokerage accounts remained relatively constant, we believe the generation of net new assets indicates higher quality customer accounts.
Customer assets in the U.S. were $159 billion at quarter end. Net new assets were a positive $400 million during the quarter, with the increase in brokerage assets more than offsetting the planned decline in customer bank assets. Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.4 billion to $21.8 billion, while bank customer cash declined by $1.8 billion, including the sale of approximately $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover. Customer margin receivables in the U.S. grew by 5% during the quarter and ended at $3.8 billion, this represented a 67% increase from a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made continued progress in the run off of our loan portfolio, with total loans declining by $1 billion during the quarter. Our loan loss provision declined for the sixth consecutive quarter from $292 million in the prior quarter to $268 million this quarter. Net charge-offs were $288 million, which was a $36 million decrease from the prior quarter.  Because our provision was less than our charge-offs this quarter, our loan loss allowance declined by $20 million. Our loan loss reserve continues to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is equal to 6% of total loans.
Delinquency trends continued to improve with quarter-over-quarter total special mention delinquencies declining by 4%, and total at-risk delinquencies declining by 8%. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our loan-modification program is having on our credit exposure and comfortable with our provision. 
As Steve highlighted earlier, we were extremely pleased that the bank generated $48 million in regulatory risk-based capital during the quarter. And while we may not generate capital in every quarter, we do expect that the bank will generate capital for the full year 2010, marking a key milestone in our return to financial strength.
Our bank capital ratios continue to be substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. As of March 31, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.83% to total adjusted assets and 13.08% to risk-weighted assets. Our sale of the savings accounts in particular, allowed us to free up approximately $50 million in Tier 1 capital. We also ended the quarter with $947 million of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators define as well-capitalized.
We ended the quarter with $418 million in corporate cash, an increase of approximately $25 million from the prior quarter. We expect to receive, during the second or third quarter, a tax refund of approximately $100 million related to the legislation in 2009 at extended net operating loss carry backs to five years. We expect that the parent company will retain $95 million of this cash, with the remaining $5 million going to the bank. Given our improving financial position, we plan to pay cash for the May coupon on our Springing Lien Notes, although we will consider this decision more specifically as we approach the interest payment date. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a change that we are making in our financial reporting this quarter. In addition to the Trading and Investing and the Balance Sheet Management segments, we are now providing increased visibility into our corporate expenses with the introduction of a new corporate segment. This new corporate segment includes unallocated expenses for finance, legal, human resource and risk management functions, as well as corporate interest expense. 
In summary, we believe that our first quarter results demonstrate the strength in our core retail franchise, and continued improvement in our overall financial condition. We welcome Steve to the organization and look forward to his leadership as we focus on growth and profitability. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks."

Before opening the call for questions, let me share a few additional comments. Clearly, we are on the right track in both our Brokerage business and in our legacy loan portfolio, and I am committed to continuing this positive trend. As we generate capital and move towards profitability, our challenge is to invest in and grow our core Brokerage business, manage legacy risk and identify and prioritize opportunities for enhancing growth. I welcome this challenge, and I am certain that the rest of our management team does too. 
And although it is still early days for me, I have several thoughts about E*TRADE's future. These include that we build on our heritage and strength as a technology leader to develop and/or embrace the next set of disruptive innovations; further leverage rapidly evolving research segmentation and decision science tools to drive more effective customer acquisition and retention, and to expand customer relationships, particularly in the long-term investor segment; enhance our product suite and customer interaction models to better serve our active trader and long-term investors segments; and continue to support our brand and extend it more fully.
Not surprisingly, these themes support our strategy to extend our leadership in the Active Trader segment, while continuing to expand our relationships with long-term investors. I look forward to the coming weeks and months as we develop and execute plans for E*TRADE's next stage of growth. And as I said earlier, I look forward to engaging with you on our progress. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

The way it works is that the provisioning is based on your actual experience, and then you forecast on that basis. And it so happens that this quarter, the loan-modification program was more skewed toward home equity than toward our first lien -- more for first lien and less home equity. And the home equity went down because we were putting in some operational changes, and that had the effect of reducing that activity during the quarter. And first liens is an area that we have been gradually increasing. So that effect creates a disproportion compared to what had been experienced, and that flows through your loan provision. Since that time, we returned to more normalized mix of loan modifications, including an increase in home equity modification. And therefore, going forward, we fully expect, starting with the second quarter, to be back to a normalized provisioning. And you'll see home equity and first lien return to their more normal trends. And overall, we expect that the provisioning for the year will not differ from where we began with our expectations."

But this is really an effect of the interplay between the two different reserves that are involved with loans, the FAS 5 reserve and the one that's specific to TDRs. The way we do a forecast, right, we need to make an assessment of the amount of modifications that are going to be done, which would in turn then create the FAS, both the FAS 5 and the TDR and the FAS 114 reserve. Because modifications for home equity were lower in the first quarter and since our forecasting is based on our most recent experience, that tended to leave more loans in a non-modified state, which would be showing up in higher FAS 5 reserves. Since we have now returned to a much normal level of home equity loans, we expect that affected us all over the next quarter or two.

And I'm very optimistic at this point about the opportunity that E*TRADE specifically presents. I also enjoy consumer-oriented franchises. We've got a terrific brand, a very strong core business. We have potential to expand that core business into other segments that I think holds significant potential.

I'm pleased to be participating in my first call as E*TRADE's Chief Executive Officer. To begin today's call, I would like to share a few thoughts, and then Bruce will take you through the first quarter results. From there, I will add a few closing comments before we take your questions.
I have had a very busy and exciting first few weeks at E*TRADE, learning more about the company, our people and our customers. This is a pivotal time for the company, and I am energized by the opportunity to lead the organization to its next phase of growth and innovation. My predecessors, Bob Druskin and Don Layton, the senior management team and really, the entire organization, navigated the company through very challenging times. And today, with a solid brokerage business, complemented by an improving balance sheet and its strength in capital structure, E*TRADE is well-positioned for growth and profitability.
I was attracted to the CEO role at E*TRADE for a number of reasons. I am a builder of businesses, and I look forward to working with a team to build on build on the company's current momentum. In addition, I believe E*TRADE's focus on expanding customer relationships, both with active traders and long-term investors, aligns well with my experience in building consumer franchises, through enhanced value propositions, customer segmentation, product innovation and world-class customer service.  E*TRADE remains a respected company with a powerful financial services brand. And as I spend time with our company and our people, I am even more confident about E*TRADE's opportunity to reach its full potential. And I look forward to engaging with you on our progress.
As Bruce will describe, E*TRADE's first quarter performance exhibits several positive trends. Earnings are headed in the right direction, our retail brokerage business continues to compete effectively, balanced levels in our loan portfolio declined at a consistent rate with improving delinquency metrics, and for the first time in two years, E*TRADE Bank internally generated rather than used capital. These trends provide us with the flexibility to make investments that will drive our continued leadership as a trading and investing platform and our ongoing expansion in the long term Investor segment. 
And with that brief introduction, I will turn the call over to Bruce."
27807,100477142,61666,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance, and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our fina",1494,"Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our quarterly financial performance, and the progress we continue to make in building out a comprehensive product and service offering that supports the needs of a broad range of investors. Before summarizing our financial results, I will review a few highlights of the quarter. 
On the product side, a number of new customer offerings and enhancements were introduced. For long-term investors, E*TRADE Capital Management introduced Managed Investment Portfolios with a competitive fee structure and an accessible entry point of only $25,000. And Power E*TRADE Pro users now have access to an expanded feature set, including streaming CNBC broadcast. In addition, E*TRADE Mobile Pro for the new iPad was recently released and we are proud that Apple highlighted our application on its download site, and during its media briefings throughout the launch. We continue to lead the industry with tools that support today's increasingly mobile investor.
During the quarter, we also simplified our fee structure to enhance our value proposition to customers. We eliminated the $12.99 pricing tier, as well as incremental commissions that apply to certain trades. And effective in the second quarter, we are eliminating all of our account inactivity fees. We expect that these changes will reduce our revenue by approximately $50 million in 2010 but view the changes as an investment in customer satisfaction, that we believe will reduce attrition rates over the long term. We were gratified that Barron's recognized our comprehensive customer experience in its 2010 annual Online Brokers Survey. Barron's awarded E*TRADE Securities four out of five stars, described us as a one-stop shopping destination, highlighted our mobile trading technology and listed us among the best firms for long-term investing.
Turning to our financial results, the company had a net loss of $48 million or $0.02 per share during the quarter, which compares with a net loss of $67 million or $0.04 per share in the prior quarter, and a loss of $233 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we generated $537 million of net revenue, which is an increase of $13 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $39 million or 8% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue this quarter included net interest income of $320 million, which was essentially flat compared with last quarter. This reflected a net interest spread of 2.96% on average interest-earning assets of $42.4 billion. Therefore, while average interest-earning assets declined by $1.4 billion, a 10 basis point expansion in interest income spread allowed us to maintain a consistent level of net interest income.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the first quarter were $196 million. This was a 5% sequential decline compared with the fourth quarter, which reflected lower retail trading activity as well as a $0.10 decline in the average commission per trade. The decline in the average commission included the impact of our recent pricing changes, which was partially offset by a more favorable customer mix this quarter.
We enjoyed increased principal transactions this quarter in our Market Making business. They were up $3 million from the prior quarter and $9 million from the prior year. Our revenue this quarter also included $29 million of net gains on loans and securities. This net gain was greater than the $9 million of impairments during the quarter. 
Our total operating expense for the first quarter declined from the prior quarter by $23 million to $295 million. This included lower compensation, real estate owned bad debt and restructuring expenses, which more than offset higher seasonal spending for advertising and market development. Our operating expense declined 4% compared with the first quarter of 2009 if we exclude FDIC insurance premiums and restructuring activities during both periods. 
We are well on the way toward completing our previously announced plan to restructure our international operations. We are exiting local market trading operations but will continue to offer customers residing outside of the U.S. the ability to trade in U.S. securities. We completed the sale of our German operation at the end of last year, and in April, we consummated the sales of our local Nordic and U.K. businesses.
During the quarter, we recorded $3.4 million in international restructuring charges. Over the next two quarters, we expect to record approximately $1 million in restructuring charges, including a $3 million credit during the second quarter and a $4 million charge during the third quarter. The restructuring charges are lower than previously expected due to a gain on the sale of the U.K. business and lower than anticipated costs. With our restructuring largely completed, we will focus on U.S. metrics going forward as the international local activity will be phasing out over the next few quarters.
DARTs for our U.S. operations were 155,000 during the first quarter, which is down 2% from the prior quarter and 11% compared with the first quarter of 2009, a period of significant market volatility. Brokerage accounts were up 2,000 and we ended the quarter with 2.6 million accounts. Net new assets flows into our U.S. Brokerage business were a positive $2.2 billion during the quarter. Therefore, while the total number of brokerage accounts remained relatively constant, we believe the generation of net new assets indicates higher quality customer accounts.
Customer assets in the U.S. were $159 billion at quarter end. Net new assets were a positive $400 million during the quarter, with the increase in brokerage assets more than offsetting the planned decline in customer bank assets. Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.4 billion to $21.8 billion, while bank customer cash declined by $1.8 billion, including the sale of approximately $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover. Customer margin receivables in the U.S. grew by 5% during the quarter and ended at $3.8 billion, this represented a 67% increase from a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made continued progress in the run off of our loan portfolio, with total loans declining by $1 billion during the quarter. Our loan loss provision declined for the sixth consecutive quarter from $292 million in the prior quarter to $268 million this quarter. Net charge-offs were $288 million, which was a $36 million decrease from the prior quarter.  Because our provision was less than our charge-offs this quarter, our loan loss allowance declined by $20 million. Our loan loss reserve continues to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is equal to 6% of total loans.
Delinquency trends continued to improve with quarter-over-quarter total special mention delinquencies declining by 4%, and total at-risk delinquencies declining by 8%. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our loan-modification program is having on our credit exposure and comfortable with our provision. 
As Steve highlighted earlier, we were extremely pleased that the bank generated $48 million in regulatory risk-based capital during the quarter. And while we may not generate capital in every quarter, we do expect that the bank will generate capital for the full year 2010, marking a key milestone in our return to financial strength.
Our bank capital ratios continue to be substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. As of March 31, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.83% to total adjusted assets and 13.08% to risk-weighted assets. Our sale of the savings accounts in particular, allowed us to free up approximately $50 million in Tier 1 capital. We also ended the quarter with $947 million of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators define as well-capitalized.
We ended the quarter with $418 million in corporate cash, an increase of approximately $25 million from the prior quarter. We expect to receive, during the second or third quarter, a tax refund of approximately $100 million related to the legislation in 2009 at extended net operating loss carry backs to five years. We expect that the parent company will retain $95 million of this cash, with the remaining $5 million going to the bank. Given our improving financial position, we plan to pay cash for the May coupon on our Springing Lien Notes, although we will consider this decision more specifically as we approach the interest payment date. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a change that we are making in our financial reporting this quarter. In addition to the Trading and Investing and the Balance Sheet Management segments, we are now providing increased visibility into our corporate expenses with the introduction of a new corporate segment. This new corporate segment includes unallocated expenses for finance, legal, human resource and risk management functions, as well as corporate interest expense. 
In summary, we believe that our first quarter results demonstrate the strength in our core retail franchise, and continued improvement in our overall financial condition. We welcome Steve to the organization and look forward to his leadership as we focus on growth and profitability. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks."

Clearly, we are on the right track in both our Brokerage business and in our legacy loan portfolio, and I am committed to continuing this positive trend. As we generate capital and move towards profitability, our challenge is to invest in and grow our core Brokerage business, manage legacy risk and identify and prioritize opportunities for enhancing growth. I welcome this challenge, and I am certain that the rest of our management team does too. 
And although it is still early days for me, I have several thoughts about E*TRADE's future. These include that we build on our heritage and strength as a technology leader to develop and/or embrace the next set of disruptive innovations; further leverage rapidly evolving research segmentation and decision science tools to drive more effective customer acquisition and retention, and to expand customer relationships, particularly in the long-term investor segment; enhance our product suite and customer interaction models to better serve our active trader and long-term investors segments; and continue to support our brand and extend it more fully.
Not surprisingly, these themes support our strategy to extend our leadership in the Active Trader segment, while continuing to expand our relationships with long-term investors. I look forward to the coming weeks and months as we develop and execute plans for E*TRADE's next stage of growth. And as I said earlier, I look forward to engaging with you on our progress. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

The way it works is that the provisioning is based on your actual experience, and then you forecast on that basis. And it so happens that this quarter, the loan-modification program was more skewed toward home equity than toward our first lien -- more for first lien and less home equity. And the home equity went down because we were putting in some operational changes, and that had the effect of reducing that activity during the quarter. And first liens is an area that we have been gradually increasing. So that effect creates a disproportion compared to what had been experienced, and that flows through your loan provision. Since that time, we returned to more normalized mix of loan modifications, including an increase in home equity modification. And therefore, going forward, we fully expect, starting with the second quarter, to be back to a normalized provisioning. And you'll see home equity and first lien return to their more normal trends. And overall, we expect that the provisioning for the year will not differ from where we began with our expectations."

But this is really an effect of the interplay between the two different reserves that are involved with loans, the FAS 5 reserve and the one that's specific to TDRs. The way we do a forecast, right, we need to make an assessment of the amount of modifications that are going to be done, which would in turn then create the FAS, both the FAS 5 and the TDR and the FAS 114 reserve. Because modifications for home equity were lower in the first quarter and since our forecasting is based on our most recent experience, that tended to leave more loans in a non-modified state, which would be showing up in higher FAS 5 reserves. Since we have now returned to a much normal level of home equity loans, we expect that affected us all over the next quarter or two.

And we have to work through as, it's clearly evident, some of the challenges of the past, which is in fact the legacy asset book. And so we can't lose sight or we can't basically let up the vigilance around that. So that in itself and again, just to remind the group, it's been all for about three weeks so that beginning to get a better understanding of both the opportunity, the issues and the risks associated with the franchise. But on balance, I couldn't think of a better company at a better time to join."

To begin today’s call, I will share a number of highlights from the recent quarter.  Then I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through the quarterly results.  After I add a few closing thoughts, we’ll be happy to take your questions.
The second quarter market was important milestone for E*TRADE as we recorded our first quarterly profit in three years.  We report net income of $35 million on net revenue of $534 million, reflecting terrific progress from a year ago when we reported $143 million loss by net revenue up $621 million.  Our results are a testament to the contributions of thousands of E*TRADE employees, and to the loyalty of millions of E*TRADE customers.  And they were certainly a nice welcome for me in my first full quarter as E*TRADE CEO.
Our profitability in the quarter was driven by several items.  First we had solid performance in our brokerage business, which strengthened new assets and growth in a number of key metrics, including DARTs, new accounts, and margin receivables.  
Second, we benefited from the ongoing improvement in loan performance trends, resulting in a substantial decline in our loan-loss provision.  
Third, we prudently managed our expenses.  
Finally, effective balance sheet strategy resulted in solid net interest income in an environment of declining interest rates as well as opportunistic gains on loans and securities.  
With this quarter’s results, we have now achieved three important milestones that support our returns as sustainable profitability.  
First, our provisions for loan losses are now consistently below charge offs, having reached that reflection point in the third quarter of 2009.
Second, we are now generating organic bank regulatory capital continuing the trend that began in the first quarter of this year.  
And third, this quarter marks our first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2007.
I am particularly pleased with results of our warrant to reduce the balance sheet and mitigate risk.  In addition to the decline related to pre-payments and scheduled principal reductions, we secured, ties, or sold $232 million in loans.  And our continued effort to put back loans to sellers resulted in a $20 million legal settlement of loan claims, which contributed $15 million to the reduction in this quarter’s provision and charge offs.  These actions supported by improving delinquency trends drove a meaningful reduction in balance sheet risk.  
While we are proud of our results, we know there is much work ahead to insure we sustain and build on our momentum.  We are gratified though that our financial progress provides us with increased flexibility to invest in the products, services, and technologies that will enhance our customer franchise to better realize growth opportunities that should drive shareholder value.  
During the second quarter, I spent time with employees in a series of town-hall events and in small meetings with our management teams.  I was energized by their engagement and their commitment to enhancing the customer experience through innovation and service.  
We have recently demonstrated this commitment in a number of areas, including the April launched of E*TRADE mobile probe for iPad to continue our leadership in the rapidly growing mobile space.  The release of open application programming interface for API allowing third party vendors and independent software developers to interface seamlessly with our investing platform.  
Growth in our relationship management team to enhance the customer sales and service experience, and the elimination of our remaining account service fees to support our transparent pricing philosophy.  This helped drive a 230 basis point sequential improvement in our customer attrition rate from 15% to 13% as we get closer to our objective of 10%.
When we spoke last quarter, I was just a few weeks in with E*TRADE, but already optimistic about the opportunities.  Since then, my initial optimism has been reinforced.  I have been very encouraged with the caliber of employees throughout E*TRADE.  They have been through a challenging period, but they continue to innovate they’re engaged, and most importantly, they have focused on winning.  
In addition, our financial progress, as I said, provides us with increased flexibility not only to reinvest in the business, but also develop the appropriate plans to enhance shareholder value.
I look forward to our ongoing dialogue as we build on our momentum.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through our results for the quarter.

Clearly, we are extremely pleased with our quarterly performance, which was supported by strength in our brokerage business, positive trends in our loan portfolio, and effective balance sheet management.  We reported net income of $35",1115,"Thank you, Steve.  Clearly, we are extremely pleased with our quarterly performance, which was supported by strength in our brokerage business, positive trends in our loan portfolio, and effective balance sheet management.  
We reported net income of $35 million, or $0.12 per share during the second quarter, which compares with a net loss of $48 million, or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter.  And a loss of $143 million, or $2.16 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we generated $534 million in the net revenue, a decline of $3 million from the prior quarter, and down $87 million, or 14% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our revenue this quarter included net interest income of $302 million, which was down $18 million compared with last quarter.  This 6% sequential decline reflected a $1.4 billion decline in average interest earning assets to $41 billion.  And a seven basis point decline in net interest spread to 2.89%.  
This reflects our strategy of maintaining a relatively consistent net interest spread despite an environment of declining interest rates.  
Commissions, fees, and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the second quarter were $195 million.  And this was essentially flat compared with the prior quarter as an increase in DARTs was offset by a $0.33 decline in average commission per trade, from $11.38 to $11.05.  This decline reflected the pricing changes that we implemented earlier this year as well as customer mix.
We again experience increased principal transactions in our market making business, which we see as a continued growth opportunity.  This business generated $29 million in revenue, which represents an increase of 10% from the prior quarter, and 26% from the prior year.
Our revenue this quarter also included $37 million of net gains on loans and securities, including a net impairment of $12 million as we managed our investment portfolio to limit our risks and realized gains due to favorable market conditions.  
Our total operating expense for the second quarter declined 7%, or $20 million from the prior quarter to $276 million.  This included lower compensation, advertising, and restructuring costs.  Our operating expense also declined by 16% from the second quarter of 2009, and by 10% if we exclude the one time FDIC assessment of $22 million in last year’s expenses.  We are pleased with this performance, which reflects our ongoing focus on expense management.  
DARTs for our U.S. operations were 170,000 during the second quarter, up 10% from the prior quarter, but down 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009, which was a period of significant market volatility.  
Net new brokerage accounts were 18,000, representing a marked improvement from last quarter’s results when added 2,000 accounts.  Moreover, brokerage accounts were up by 21,000 if not for the reduction of 3,000 cross-border accounts in connection with our European restructuring.
Net new asset flows into our U.S. brokerage business were a positive $2.1 billion during the quarter, and now total $4.3 billion year to date.  
Brokerage customer cash declined by $1.1 billion to $20.7 billion while customers were net buyers of $3.4 billion in securities.  
Bank customer cash declined by $1.2 billion.  
Customer margin receivables in the U.S. grew by 26% during the quarter and ended at $4.8 billion.  This represented a 60% increase from a year ago.  
As Steve highlighted earlier, we are pleased with the performance in our loan portfolio.  The portfolio contracted by $1.2 billion during the quarter, including $232 million in loan securitizations or sales, and $746 million related to loan pre-payments were scheduled principal reductions.  
Our loan loss provision declined from $268 million in the first quarter to $166 million in the second quarter.  This is the seventh consecutive quarterly decline in the provision, which is now 68% below its peak of $518 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Equally important, loan charge offs declined from $288 million in the first quarter to $225 million in the second quarter.  This is the fourth consecutive quarterly decline, and charge offs are now 42% below their peak of $386 million in the second quarter of 2009.
The decline in the loan-loss provision in charge-offs this quarter included the benefit of a legal settlement on loan claims as we continued to look for opportunities to put back loans to sellers.  The $20 million settlement contributed $15 million to the declines during the second quarter.  And we expect the remaining $5 million to reduce our provision and charge-offs in the third and fourth quarters.  The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $59 million from the prior quarter, and remains at 6% of gross loans receivable.
The improvement in our loan loss provision and loan charge-offs was driven primarily by our improving delinquency trends.  Total special mentioned delinquencies declined by 14%, with a decline in the in the 1-4 family portfolio of 17%, and a decline in the home equity portfolio of 8%.  Total special mentioned delinquencies are now down 36% from their peak in the fourth quarter of 2008.  
Overall, we were extremely pleased with the improved credit performance and expect the credit cost will continue to decline, however because the timing and magnitude of the improvement is affected by many factors.  We anticipate variability in any one quarter while continued to see a downward trend over the long term.
We are pleased that the bank generated capital again this quarter.  The bank generated $61 million in regulatory risk based capital during the quarter, bringing the year to date total to $108 million.  Our bank capital ratios continue to be substantially in excess of regulatory well-capitalized thresholds.  As of June 30, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.27% to total adjusted assets, and 13.39% to risk weighted assets.  
We ended the quarter with $1 billion of risk based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators define as well capitalized.  
We also are very pleased to report that we generated substantial capital on a consolidated basis during the quarter.  We increased consolidated Tier 1 capital from 1.1 to 1.5 billion.  And we increased our tangible common equity from $1.7 to $2.1 billion.  
We ended the quarter with $181 million in corporate cash.  This is an increase of approximately $63 million from the prior quarter, and included $100 million refund on the tax loss carry-back legislation, a $25 million dividend from the bank, and a $58 million cash payment of the May coupon on our Spring and Lee notes.
To summarize, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter, and look forward to building on our momentum.  
With that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks.

First, I would like to comment on the Financial Regulatory Reform Legislation that was signed into law yesterday.  While this legislation is generally considered to be comprehensive for the financial service industry as a whole, we believe the majority of the changes will have no material impact on our business.  
The implementation of Holding Company Capital Requirements, however, is relevant to us as the parent company is not currently subject to capital requirements.  
With that said, we fully expect that our holding company capital ratios will exceed the well capitalized minimums well in advance of the requirement.
Our confidence in our ability to meet these requirements is reinforced by a few items.  First, our trajectory towards sustainable profitability as demonstrated in our second quarter results.  
Second, anticipated additional conversions of our convertible debt, and third, the utilization of our deferred tax asset as we deliver profitable results.
Therefore, I want to emphasize that at this time, we are quite comfortable in our ability to meet these future holding company capital requirements.  And we have no plans to raise additional capital as a result of the financial regulatory reform.
Finally, we had a very productive quarter on all fronts.   With organic capital generation, improving trends in the loan portfolio, and now return to profitability, we are on the right track to enhance shareholder value.  And I am fully committed to this most important objective.
I look forward to the coming months as we develop and execute plans for E*TRADE’s next stage of growth.  And I look forward to engaging with you on our progress as respect to the company’s strategy for delivering shareholder value.
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.

They are very low cost, very stable, and very profitable deposits for E*TRADE.  And so that alone really is a compelling reason to have the financial institution to bank.

One, Macro around the mortgage portfolio and one are a little more granular.  I guess, you know, looking at this quarter again and prior quarters, you’ve been, you know, selling off bits and pieces of the portfolio as opportunities arise.  I mean, I guess looking at the portfolio as a whole at this point, how wide of a gap do you think there is?  I imagine you look at this fairly regularly between what you think the value on a mark-to-market basis would be versus what you’ve accrued to.  I mean I would assume that gap continues to shrink.

That said, I don’t really have, you know, a specific valuation or number.  As you’re probably aware, the portfolio really is I think designated as a portfolio that we will hold, a hold for maturity portfolio so that our flexibility around the portfolio is, relatively speaking, extremely limited.  But all in all, it’s a portfolio that we continue to be aggressive in the management dove.  I think you’ve seen in the results this quarter in particular, we shrunk the portfolio by $1.2 billion, combination of kind of our normal processes, plus the ability to secure ties and sell possibly $230 million of assets.  And just to make a point, we sold it actually at a profit, so it went out at above par, which we thought was actually a terrific thing to occur, particularly in this environment.
So, you know, we’ll continue to manage the portfolio, particularly the Legacy book, down.  But at the same time, I think it would be unrealistic to make any assumption that there would be, you know, one large solution to the challenge portfolio.

A fair amount of restructuring on the, particularly on the local international businesses as well as restructuring, you know, domestic business.  And what we’re seeing is the benefit of that now flowing through the P&L.  
So A, it’s sustainable.  In fact, the comp lines from the standpoint of looking out over time should continue to basically follow I think a reasonably good trend.  And that’s just again a testament to getting partization into the business as well as for the hard work that E*TRADE employees have accomplished.
It really had three dimensions to it.  One is confidence as you pointed out.  The second is on a sequential basis, the marketing costs have come down as well. But if you look at a year-on-year basis, we continue to reinvest at a higher rate in the franchise meaning marketing costs are actually higher by about 15% on year on year basis.
And then finally, particularly on a sequential basis, the restructuring costs in the second quarter were better than what we basically had in the first quarter.  That really makes up, I think, the combination. 
I guess to reemphasize, you know, part of my role is to continue to put a fair amount of pressure on the expense line. But at the same time, not only take expenses where appropriate lower, but we direct them open to marketing and sales as well as product and technology.  We can grow the franchise.

And you’re carrying allowances that’s well above what you would take as the annual run rate there.  You know, if you just take $70 million, it would be %280.  So I guess the question, and on home equity, you know, it looks like you play a little catch up with the modification and release reserves.

That would be like the online brokerage business.  So maybe it’s $20 to $30 billion.  I’m just trying to understand, you know like what’s the offset?

If you think about E*TRADE or the industry, first and foremost the trading business, I think you made a point on DARTS, it has it’s on inherent volitility.  Although, if you look over long trends, you know, we expect that business, broadly as an industry, it may not be specific to E*TRADE, probably grows at 5%-7% a year.  Obviously, with a lot of volitility in between.  
I think secondarily, particularly for E*TRADE, we have a longer-term opportunity to basically to better serve and therefore better translate into what economic benefit for E*TRADE.  The investor population, which is somewhat distinct from the trading population, we have a large and better base of those folks.  And we’ve begun, over the last year, to provide, build, develop more product service that would provide the relevant level of value prop to those folks.  But we still have a lot of opportunity ahead of us there. So it’s an area of opportunity. 
It think thirdly, I think to your point, the bank which has been a source of both economic profit on the deposit side, and the downside of that is a lot of that historically was invested in assets that never did turn out to perform the way we had expect.  But overtime, you know, as that normalizes, you know, the bank, whether it invests basically in securities or any other, or any other asset, should be a very profitable enterprise for this entity.  
And then finally, I think Bruce, yeah, Bruce covered it in the piece.  We have some terrific so terrific secondary - not second tier businesses, but secondary businesses particularly in larger banking, particularly in corporate services, we provide both options and restrictive stock plans to a number of company with are important to us with the new customers coming through there.  
We have plenty of options to grow.  We just have to basically get our house fully in order, which is really what we’ve been accomplishing over the last several years.  But we have, I think, many options, many leverages to grow the firm.  
In my first 100 days or so here, what I basically tried to do is to understand the industry, understand E*TRADE and then begin to start to put these into what the right set of priorities would be so that we can actually grow the top five, as well as benefit from what you’ve seen on the bottom line.  
The goal is to basically have the concert play all the instruments, top and bottom, so we kind of play it out.

But the trend has been, from a factual standpoint, as we’ve freed up essentially cash or freed up basically the liabilities from the asset as $1 billion over the quarter has rolled off.  We have fundamentally reinvested in largely, agency securities.  That has been the strategy up through now.  That doesn’t mean that we’ll sustain it in its absolute form, but I would say that that will still be a very important part of what we do.

Maybe if you can just touch on maybe four buckets of that.

One, on many fronts, the overall profitability helped the company continue to improve.  As we said, I think our earnings release and our commentary gives us many more degrees of freedom to pursue the opportunities that we think are best suited for the company.  And it probably will fall into lots of separate categories.  
We would like to intelligently enhance our marketing spend, you know, where it makes sense.  And there’s a whole host of ways to do it.  Some actually cost money, some basically cost in resources versus money.  So I’ll just give you some examples. 
As we speak, we’re working on basically kind of new prospect home pages.  We’re working on basically reorienting our advertising.  You’ll probably see more of that coming into the late third and into the fourth quarter, more aggressively actually.  And actually, importantly, it’s not so much spend, but more of segmentation analytic, a lot of testing and learning that we have approximately 15 million prospects that come to our website annually.  
We have recently reach the conversion rate measured by industry standards, but there’s an immense opportunity, we believe to do better.  And in addition to that, we have a large number of customers who come to us who opened accounts, but never fund.  We think we have a large opportunity to do better and that’s through being smarter about the touch points and the through puts, and basically how we can bring them from, I would say hollow accounts to more productive accounts.  
In addition to that, which really was started in the later part of 2009, we started converting more relational service and relational sales people into the company.  And again, our costs are coming down as we’re basically putting on a higher caliber personal interface with our customer base, and we’ll continue to invest in that because the [inaudible] model looks reasonably good.  
In addition to that, and a bit more tactical, working on things like portfolio margining, three-and-four-legged spreads.  Working on basically leveraging what I would say are more common aspects in any online segment today, like communities.  We can go on, and on, and on, and on.  
So there’s a lot of opportunity ahead of us.  The question is prioritization and then how we fund it without bloating the cost base.  So in a perfect world, we’ll be smarter and we’ll be leaner, and more productive.  And this is a bit premature, but that’s sort of the direction we’re taking the company.

To begin this afternoon's call, I will cover highlights from the third quarter and then Bruce will take you through the results. From there, I'll share some thoughts on the opportunities we see for the business, after which, we will be happy to take your questions.
The third quarter was an important one for E*TRADE as we delivered our second consecutive quarterly profit. We reported pretax income of $36 million and achieved positive net income for the quarter despite an unusually high reported tax rate. Strength in a number of areas support our performance in a quarter that was notable for the industry-wide decline in trading activity and a challenging interest rate environment. We were pleased with the growth in net new assets and average margin receivables and the quality of new accounts in the brokerage business. Improvement in both those trends drove the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in our loan loss provision. Effective balance sheet strategies resulted in solid net interest income and we benefited from opportunistic gains in our securities portfolio.
Our results demonstrated progress in positioning the company for sustainable profitability and growth as we continued to execute on a number of key objectives. Our provision for loan losses has been below charge-offs for five consecutive quarters. We have generated organic bank regulatory capital each quarter this year and we have delivered our second consecutive profitable quarter. During the quarter, we executed on a number of initiatives to expand our offering to both active traders and long-term investors. In June, we released application programming interface, or API, allowing third party vendors and independent software developers to interface seamlessly with our investing platform. In September, we introduced new research and trade idea generation tools, including market commentary from Dreyfus and buzzing banter from Unionville [ph] (08:50), a leading business and finance site. 
Also in September, we launched a new cross media ad campaign including TV spots that are running during highly-rated fall sporting events and primetime programming. The campaign, with a new tagline, ""investing unleashed"", includes several E*TRADE baby spots as well as product ads that speak directly to self-directed investors who are ready to take control of their finances. It is a high-impact campaign that moves the brand forward and positions us well for the fourth quarter, as well as 2011. In addition, our ongoing investment in the overall customer experience, including a growing relationship management team and simplified pricing, continues to pay off. This supported a sequential improvement in our annualized brokerage account attrition rate from 13% to 10%, our lowest attrition rate in more than six years and a level we will strive to sustain over the long run. 
We also received industry recognition for our corporate services organization from Group 5, a leader in equity compensation research, which named us number one in overall satisfaction and loyalty for Stock Plan administration in its 10th annual benchmarking survey. Our corporate services group, which provides stock plan administrative tools and services continues to gain traction and now counts 20% of the S&P 500 as clients. This continues to be an attractive opportunity for us, both as a stand-alone business and as a meaningful source of new retail brokerage accounts. With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through our results for the quarter."

While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio and solid net interest income. We reported net income of $8 million or $0.03 per share during the third quarter, which compares with net income of $35 million or $0.12 per share in the prior quarter and a net loss of $855 million or $6.74 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Our third quarter 2009 results included a non-cash charge on debt exchange of $773 million or $6.09 per share. When excluding the impact of the debt exchange, we had a net loss of $82 million or $0.65 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
We reported pretax income of $36 million for the quarter. But as Steve noted, we had an unusually high reported tax rate this quarter. So let me explain. Although our actual tax rate continues to be approximately 38%, our reported tax rate is much higher because certain of our expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. For example, and most importantly, about 1/3 of our interest expense on the Springing Lien Note is not deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, while our reported pretax income is $36 million, our income subject to taxation is higher, resulting this quarter in a much higher reported tax rate of 76%. This is due not only to the higher amount of taxable income but also to the fact that our reported pretax income for the year is relatively close to break even. The additional pretax income from the Springing Lien Note is about $35 million per year and the annual tax on that income is about $10 million. Therefore, this issue will be mitigated if our reported pretax income grows in the future.
We produced $489 million of net revenue during the quarter, a decline of $45 million from the prior quarter and down $86 million or 15% from the same quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue was driven almost entirely by the decrease in trading activity as was experienced across the industry. We were pleased to maintain a relatively consistent level of interest income of $299 million. The $3 million decline from the prior quarter reflected a $1.3 billion decrease in average interest earning assets to $39.7 billion, which was largely offset by a six basis-point expansion in net interest spread to 2.95%. This reflect our strategy of maintaining a relatively consistent net interest spread despite an environment of declining interest rates.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the third quarter were $151 million. This was down 23% compared with the prior quarter and was impacted by the decline in DARTs and a very slight decline in average commission per trade from $11.05 to $11.03. our revenue this quarter also included $40 million of net gains in loans and securities, including a net impairment of $7 million, as we managed our investment portfolio to limit our risk and we realized gains due to favorable market opportunities. This compares with $37 million of net gains in the second quarter and $23 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Our total operating expense for the third quarter declined 3% or $9 million from the prior quarter to $267 million, which represented a 12% decline from the third quarter of 2009. This included lower compensation and clearing expense as well as a $6 million credit against professional service fees as part of a legal settlement.
Let's turn now to metrics. As noted, we experienced a slowdown in trading activity over the summer, certainly in comparison to record highs in recent years. DARTs for the third quarter were $127,000, down 26% from the prior quarter and down 30% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, we saw strength in a number of areas. Net new asset flows into our brokerage business were a positive $1.4 billion during the quarter and totaled $5.7 billion year-to-date. Net new brokerage accounts were 7,000, bringing account growth for the year to 27,000 and we ended the quarter with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts. 
Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.9 billion to $22.6 billion while customers were net sellers of $1.3 billion in securities. Bank customer cash declined by $600 million. In total, we experienced a net increase of $1.3 billion of customer cash deposits, which was a positive contributor to our net interest income. Another positive contributor was increased margin loans to customers. Average margin receivables grew by 4% during the quarter from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. This represented a 52% increase from a year ago. 
We were pleased with the performance of our loan portfolio. The portfolio contracted by $1 billion during the quarter and our loan loss provision declined from $166 million in the second quarter to $152 million in the third quarter. This is the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in the provision, which is now 71% below its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Loan charge-offs declined slightly from $225 million in the second quarter to $222 million in the third quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline and charge-offs are now 43% below their peak of $386 million in the second quarter of 2009. The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $1 billion, down $70 million from the prior quarter and remains at 6% of gross loans receivable.
We expect that credit cost will continue to decline. However, because the timing and magnitude of the improvement is affected by many factors, we anticipate variability in any one quarter while continuing to see a downward trend over the long term. Related to the recent decisions by a number of banks to suspend or review their foreclosure programs, we do not expect any material direct impact although we may be indirectly affected as any delays work their way through the system. As a reminder, E*TRADE does not service any of its loan portfolio and we rely exclusively on third-party services. 
We are pleased that the Bank generated capital again this quarter. The Bank generated $81 million in regulatory risk-based capital, bringing the year-to-date total to $191 million. As of September 30, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.41% to total adjusted assets and 13.75% to risk-weighted assets. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of risk-based total capital, in excess of the level that our regulators define as well capitalized.
On a consolidated basis, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in Tier 1 capital and our tangible common equity was $2.1 billion, both slightly higher than second quarter levels. We ended the quarter with $490 million in corporate cash. This is an increase of approximately $9 million from the prior quarter and included a $34 million dividend from the Bank. Finally, I want to note that our corporate interest income this quarter benefited by $6 million from a legal settlement. In all, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter and look forward to building on our momentum. And with that, I will the turn the call back to Steve for additional remarks."

Before opening the call for questions, I would like to share a few comments related to future plans and initiatives. When we spoke last quarter, I had been on board approximately 100 days and we had just reported our first quarter of profitability in three years. The company has achieved a number of important milestones, allowing us to shift gears from defense to offense and providing the flexibility to review opportunities for future growth. 
We seem to have focused on areas where we see potential for driving enhanced growth and profitability and we'll highlight four categories: First, we have a solid retail brokered franchise that has performed extremely well throughout its history, most recently contributing great results that were often overshadowed by challenges in the loan portfolio. With a base of all-time high 2.7 million brokered accounts, complemented by an enhanced marketing spend, we believe there are continued opportunities to expand our relationship, sales, product and service initiatives to grow our active trader and long-term investor customer bases. Our growing sales force will emphasize long-term investor retirement solutions including the advisor-based management investment portfolios as well as a full suite of fund and fixed income brokerage product offerings. 
We'll also continue to expand our offering for active traders and are in the early launch phase of portfolio margining three- or four-legged option spreads, E*TRADE communities and additions to our mobile trading application, specifically E*TRADE Mobile Pro for Android. On the marketing side as I mentioned earlier, we have been evolving our advertising to include product and service focus messaging in addition to iconic E*TRADE Baby. And we believe we have a terrific opportunity to better engage with a 15 million prospects that visit our website each year. 
Second, we have significant institutional brokerage opportunities, notably our Corporate Services and Capital Markets groups. Both of these businesses have scale and are market leaders. Our Corporate Services group continues to make progress with new and expanded businesses in both software and services and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts. Our Capital Markets group also provides a strong foundation for organic growth in our market-making activities. We are competing effectively and acquiring more external order flow and we'll continue to ensure we are extracting maximum economic benefit from our retail customer engagement. 
Third, as we continue to expand our wealth management offering for long-term investors via existing sales and service channels, we will leverage our heritage of innovation with an eye towards delivering value propositions that redefine the customer experience for self-directed investors. E*TRADE was a pioneer in online trading and we believe that we have an opportunity to play a similar role in online investing, as customer needs and technologies evolve. 
Finally, we believe our Bank can play an important role in helping us to optimize the value of our very large and stable brokerage customer deposit base. With a focus on these four areas, which build on our current strengths and in many cases, existing assets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We are actively executing against these growth strategies and we'll keep you informed on our progress.
As we do this, I assure you that we will remain intensely focused on flawless execution and rigorous expense management. I am gratified to see the energy across the organization as we seize the growth opportunities that lie ahead for E*TRADE. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

First, we agree that our preference is to have a basically distinctive upward slope on the yield curve and it elevates the level of rates, which really has been part of the challenge which Bruce alluded to during the quarter. That said, we've done several things that help maintain basically the net interest margin. In fact, improve the net interest margin during the period. First, which I think is strategic for us, we continue to basically grow our margin book, which is actually important. Second, we basically have the opportunity that we've executed on to deploy investment strategies and keep cash at a lower level that we might have otherwise but sufficient to run our businesses. So cash basically earning very little in the overall business. And finally, we have had the opportunity to basically invest, as you know, in agency-backed securities, which is essentially where we invest our excess as the legacy loan portfolios come down and I think basically our treasury area has played essentially that role basically smartly and have done very well in that pursuit. Bruce said on the call three months back that we would strive to keep net interest margin in roughly the 300 basis-point range. Obviously, there's no precision around 300 but we would say with a level of confidence that we will maintain it within that range, plus or minus. But we strive to stay relatively neutral on rate moves in either direction."

Let me answer that. Broader volumes is that we have, since my arrival, done segmentation work on what could be described as good bank, bad bank, and without going through -- you have the detail, either analysis or numbers, as expected embedded in the roughly $17 billion legacy portfolio, there are a large number of customers of E*TRADE that have very good profiles, both from the standpoint of how they look on their own basically set of either I would say FICO demographic and other. In addition to that, they've had basically consistent level of payment history with us and there's absolutely nothing wrong with them. And if we had a choice, we'd rather maintain them longer than shorter. That said, now that we have a few of good bank, bad bank, we are looking at evaluating strategies that might allow us to optimize within. But the debt to mature goes through any detail related to that other than to say that the $17 billion or so is not a monolith. And within that, there's an opportunity and when we're basically further down the line, we'd be more than pleased to have a broader dialogue on that topic."

Actually we're all very pleased with the performance of delinquencies over this year. I think total special mention, including both first lien and home equity, are down in the neighborhood of 25%. You are right, the improvement more recently in home equity has been flatter than first lien, that we expected because our first lien portfolio was less season, so it took a longer time for some of the poorer credits to run through there. But where we are now it's still I believe in that we're within this long-term trend. But there will be variability from month-to-month. So you're right, in September there was what I would call a fairly modest uptick. But if you look over the past four, five or six months, the trend has been flattish to down. So I don't think that'll change but we think the rate of improvement, particularly the home equity would probably be more moderate."

On the other side, and kind of basically picking up on Bruce's commentary, that we would expect and strategically want to grow our consumer deposit base, particularly our consumer deposits coming from our Brokerage business. That said, as those deposits grow and they have been growing, we probably will diminish, which is what we have been doing as well, continue to do this wholesale funding and, hopefully, we will grow the business. And I think the balance sheet, over the longer-term, will be more determined by the size of our customer deposits, strategic customer deposits than anything else and we'll adjust asset side of the balance sheet accordingly.

As I said in the opening commentary, our expectation is we'll strive hard to maintain it. I'd like to say is we'll try hard to improve upon it to get into the single digits.

On the RAA [ph] (56:29) business, it hasn't been a business that we've been in in the past and our business model really has been one that's direct to the customer. And so not disagreeing but it's a fast or growing segment of the broader industry. It just hasn't been an area that we've pursued. So it's something that again, we would consider. But in the world of privatization its not high on our list of priorities, at least over the intermediate term. In contrast, for example, we would much prefer to rev up our corporate services group and grow more rapidly there, then basically enter an area that is costly to enter and will take a long time in our view to get aggregate profitability. So we just have to be conscious not only of the opportunity but the cost of entry, and what alternatives are. And again, because of it wasn't central to the business model over time, I'll never say never, but I don't want to mislead anybody to say that we're going to jump into that area. From the standpoint of the managed investment products and the like, I'll let Mike comment on that as to what we have in the marketplace, how we basically have distributed those products and what some of the near-term opportunities are in that particular space as we tried to basically service both the investment needs of our clients in addition to what we historically done, which has been predominantly the trading needs of our clients."

To begin this afternoon’s call, I will cover highlights from the third quarter, and then Bruce will take you through the results.  From there, I’ll share some thoughts on the opportunities we see for the business after which we will be happy to take your questions.
The third quarter was an important one for E*TRADE as we delivered our second consecutive quarterly profit.  We reported pre-tax income of 36 million, and achieved positive net income for the quarter despite an unusually reported tax rate.  
Strength in a number of areas supported our performance in a quarter that was notable for the industry-wide decline in trading activity, and a challenging interest rate environment.
We were pleased with the growth in net new assets, and average margin receivables, and with the quality of new accounts in the brokerage business.
Improvement in loan performance trends drove the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in our loan-loss provision.  Effective balance sheet strategies resulted in solid net interest income, and we benefited from opportunistic gains in our securities portfolio.
Our results demonstrated progress in positioning the company for sustainable profitability in growth as we continue to execute on a number of key objectives.  
Our provision for loan losses has been below charge-offs for five consecutive quarters.  We have generated organic-bank regulatory capital each quarter this year.  And we have delivered our second consecutive profitable quarter.
During the quarter, we executed on a number of initiatives to expand our offering to both active traders and long-term investors.  
In June, we released application programming interface for API, allowing third-party vendors and independent software developers to interface seamlessly with our investing platform.  
In September, we introduced new research and trade idea generation tools, including market commentary from Dreyfus and Buzz and Banta from Minyanville; a leading business and finance site.  
Also in September, we launched a new cross- media ad campaign including TV spots that are running during highly-rated fall sporting events and primetime programming.
The campaign with the tagline,  Investing Unleased, includes several new E*TRADE baby spots as well as product ads that speak directly to self-directed investors who are ready to take control of their finances.  It is a high-impact campaign that moves the brand forward and positions us well for the fourth quarter as well as 2011.
In addition, our ongoing investment in the overall customer experience including a growing relationship management team and simplified pricing continues to pay off.  This supported a sequential improvement in our annualized brokerage account attrition rate from 13% to 10%; our lowest attrition rate in more than six years, and a level we will strive to sustain over the long run.
We also received industry recognition for our Corporate Services Organization from Group Five, the leader in equity compensation research, which named us number one in overall satisfaction and loyalty for stock plan administration in its tenth-annual benchmarking survey.  
Our Corporate Services Group, which provides stock plan administrative tools and services continues to gain traction, and now counts 20% of the S&P 500 as clients.  This continues to be an attractive opportunity for us both as a standalone business, and as a meaningful source of new retail brokerage accounts.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through our results for the quarter.

While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio, and solid net interest income.We",1202,"Thank you Steve.  
While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio, and solid net interest income.
We reported net income of 8 million, or $0.03 per share during the third quarter, which compares with net income of 35 million, or $0.12 per share in the prior quarter, and a net loss of 855 million, or $6.74 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
Our Third Quarter 2009 results included a non-cash charge on debt exchange of 773 million, or $6.09 per share.  When excluding the impact of the debt exchange, we had a net loss of 82 million, or $0.65 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
We reported pre-tax income of 36 million for the quarter, but as Steve noted, we had an unusually high reported tax rate this quarter, so let me explain.  
Although our actual tax rate continues to be approximately 38%, our reported tax rate is much higher because certain of our expenses are not deductible for tax purposes.  For example and most importantly, about 1/3 of interest expense on the Springling Notes is not deductible for tax purposes.  Therefore, while our reported pre-tax income is 36 million, our income subject to taxation is higher resulting this quarter in a much higher reported tax rate of 76%.  This is due not only to the higher amount of taxable income, but also to the fact that our reported pre-tax income for the year is relatively close to break even.
The addition pre-tax income from the Springling notes is about 35 million per year.  And the annual tax on that income is about $10 million.  Therefore, this issue will be mitigated if our reported pre-tax income grows in the future.
We produced 489 million of net revenue during the quarter, a decline of 45 million from the prior quarter, and down 86 million, or 15% from the same quarter a year ago.  The decline in revenue was driven almost entirely by the decrease in trading activity as was experienced across the industry.
We were pleased to maintain a relatively consistent level of interest income of 299 million.  The 3 million decline from the prior quarter reflected a 1.3 billion decrease in average interest earning assets to 39.7 billion, which was largely offset by a six basis point expansion; a net interest spread to 2.95%.  This reflects our strategy of maintaining a relatively consistent net interest spread despite an environment of declining interest rates.
Commissions, fees, and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the third quarter were 151 million.  This was down 23% compared to the prior quarter, and was impacted by the decline in DARTS, and a very slight decline in average commission per trade from $11.05 to $11.03.
Our revenue this quarter also included 40 million of net gains in loans and securities, including a net impairment of 7 million as we managed our investment portfolio to limit our risks and we realized gains due to favorable market opportunities.  This compares with 37 million of net gains in the second quarter, and 23 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Our total operating expense for the third quarter decline 3%, or 9 million from the prior quarter to 267 million, which represented a 12% decline from the third quarter of 2009.  This included lower compensation in clearing expense, as well as a 6 million credit against professional service fees as part of the legal settlement.
Let’s turn now to metrics.  As noted, we experienced a slowdown in trading activity over the summer, certainly in comparison to record highs in recent years.  DARTS for the third quarter were 127,000, down 26% from the prior quarter, and down 30% compared with the third quarter of 2009.  
Nevertheless, we saw strength in a number of areas.  Net new asset flows into our brokerage business were a positive 1.4 billion during the quarter, and total 5.7 billion in year to date.  Net new brokerage accounts were 7,000, bringing account growth for the 27,000.   And we ended the quarter with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts.  
Brokerage customer cash increased by 1.9 billion to 22.6 billion while customers were net sellers of 1.3 billion in securities.
Bank customer cash declined by 600 million.  In total, we experienced a net increase of 1.3 billion of customer cash deposits, which was a positive contributor to our net interest income.
Another positive contributor was increased margin loans to customers.  Average margin receivables grew by 4% during the quarter from 4.5 billion to 4.7 billion.  This represented a 52% increase from a year ago.
We were pleased with the performance of our loan portfolio.  The portfolio contracted by 1 billion during the quarter, and our loan loss provision declined from 166 million in the second quarter to 152 million in the third quarter.  This is the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in the provision, which is now 71% below its peak in the third quarter of 2008.
Loan charge-offs declined slightly from 225 million in the second quarter to 222 million in the third quarter.  This is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline, and charge-offs are now 43% below their peak of 386 million in the second quarter of 2009.
The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at 1 billion, down 70 million from the prior quarter and remains at 6% of gross loans receivable.
We expect that credit costs will continue to decline.  However, because the timing and magnitude of the improvement is affected by many factors, we anticipate variability in any one quarter, while continued to see a downward trend over the long-term.
Related to the recent decisions by a number of banks to suspend or review their foreclosure programs, we do not expect any material direct impact, although we may indirectly affected as any delays work their way through the system.  
As a reminder, E*TRADE does not service any of its loan portfolio and we rely exclusively on third-party services.  
We are pleased that the bank generated capital again this quarter.  The bank generated 81 million in regulatory risk-based capital bringing the year-to-date total to 191 million.  As of September 30, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.14% to total adjusted assets, and 13.75% to risk weighted assets.  We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion of risk-based total capital in excess of the level that our regulators defined as well capitalized.
On a consolidated basis, we ended the quarter with 1.5 billion in tier one capital, and our tangible common equity was 2.1 billion, both slightly higher than second quarter levels.
We ended the quarter with 490 million in corporate cash.  This is an increase of approximately 9 million from the prior quarter, and included a 31, or $34 million dividend from the bank.
Finally, I want to note that our corporate interest income this quarter benefited by 6 million from a legal settlement.  
In all, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter, and look forward to building on our momentum.  
And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve for additional remarks.

Before opening the call for questions, I would like to share a few comments related to future plans and initiatives.
When we spoke last quarter, I had been on board approximately 100 days, and we had just reported our first quarter of profitability in three years.  The company has achieved a number of important milestones allowing us to shift gears from defense to offense.  And providing the flexibility to review opportunities for future growth.
We since have focused on areas where we see potential for driving enhanced growth and profitability.  I will highlight four categories.
First, we have a solid retail brokerage franchise that has performed extremely well throughout its history, most recently contributing great results that were often over shadowed by challenges in the loan portfolio.  With a base of all-time high 2.7 million brokerage accounts complemented by an enhanced marketing spend, we believe there are continued opportunities to expand our relationship sales, products, and service initiatives to grow our active trader and long-term investor customer basis.
Our growing sales force will emphasize long-term investor retirement solutions, including the advisor based managed investment portfolios, as well as a full suite of fund and fixed-income brokerage product offerings.
We will also continue to expand our offering for active traders and are in the early launch phase of portfolio margin in three or four option spreads, E*TRADE communities, and additions to our mobile trading applications specifically E*TRADE Mobile Pro for Android.
On the marketing side as I mentioned earlier, we have been evolving our advertising to include product and service focused messaging in addition to iconic E*TRADE Baby.  And we believe we have a terrific opportunity to better engage with the 15 million prospects that visit our website each year.
Second, we have significant institutional brokerage opportunities, notably our Corporate Services and Capital Markets Groups.  Both these businesses have scaled and are market leaders. 
Our corporate services group continues to make progress with new and expanded businesses in both software and services.  And is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts.
Our capital markets group also provides a strong foundation for organic growth in our market making activities.  We are completing effectively, and acquiring more external order flow.  We will continue to insure we are extracting maximum economic benefit from our retail customer engagement.  
Third, as we continue to expand our wealth management offering for long-term investors via existing sales and service channels, we will leverage our heritage of innovation with an eye toward delivering value propositions that we define the customer experience for self-directed investors.
E*TRADE was a pioneer in online trading, and we believe that we have an opportunity to play a similar role in online investing as customer needs and technologies evolve. 
Finally, we believe our bank can play an important role in helping us to optimize the value of our very large and stable brokerage customer deposit base.  
With a focus on these four areas, which build on our current strengths, and many cases existing assets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead.  We are actively executing against these growth strategies, and we’ll keep you informed on our progress.  As we do this, I assure you that we will remain intensely focused on flawless execution and rigorous expensed management.  I am gratified to see the energy across the organization as we seize the growth opportunities that lie ahead for E*TRADE.
With that operator, we are ready to take questions.

First we agreed that our preference is to have basically this distinctive upwards slope on the yield curve and you know, it elevated the level of brace, which clearly has been part of the challenge that Bruce alluded to during the quarter.  
You know, that said, we’ve done several things that helped maintain basically the net-interest margin, and in fact improved the net-interest margin during the period.  You know at first, which I think is strategic for us.  You know, we continue to basically grow our margin book, which is actually important.  
Second, we basically have the opportunity that we’ve executed on to deploy investment strategies and keep cash at a lower level than we might have otherwise, but sufficient to run our businesses.  So cash basically is earning very little in the overall business. 
And finally, we have had the opportunity to basically invest as you know in agency-backed securities, which is essentially where we invest our excess as our legacy-loan portfolios come down.  And I think basically our treasury area has played essentially that role of basically smart lead and it’s done very well in that pursuit.  
Bruce said on the call pretty much that we would strive to keep our net-interest margin in roughly the 300 basis point range.  You know, obviously there’s no precision around 300, but we would say that we have a level of confidence that we will maintain it within that range, plus or minus, but we strive to stay relatively neutral on rate moves in either direction.

For the broader audience, it’s that we have, since my arrival, done segmentation work on what could be described as good-bank bad-bank and without going through detail, either analysis or numbers, as expected embedded in the roughly $17 billion legacy portfolio there are a larger number of customers of E*TRADE that have very good profiles both from the standpoint of how they look on their own, basically either I would say FICO, demographic and other.  And in addition to that they’ve had basically consistent level of payment history with us and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with them and if we had a choice we’d rather maintain them longer than shorter.  
So you know, that said, now that we have a view of good-bank bad-bank we are looking at and evaluating strategies that might allow us to optimize within, but it’s a bit premature to go into any detail related to that other than just say that the 17 billion or so is not a model and within that there’s opportunity.  And when we’re basically further down the line we’d be more than pleased to have a broader dialog on that topic.

You are right, the improvement more recently in Home Equity has been flatter than First Lane, than what we expected because of our First Lane portfolio is better seasoned so it took longer time for some of the core credits to run through there.  
But where we are now, it’s still believing that we’re within this long-term trend, but there will be variability from month to month so you’re right, in September there was what I would call a fairly modest uptick but if you look over the past four, five or six months, the trend has been flattest to down.

On the other side, and kind of basically picking up on Bruce’s commentary, we would expect and strategically want to grow our consumer deposit base, particularly our consumer deposits coming from our brokerage business.  That said, as those deposits grow and they have been growing, we probably will diminish, which is what we have been doing as well.  And hopefully we will grow the business, and I think the balance sheet, over a longer term will be more determined by the size of our customer deposits, strategic customer deposits than anything else and will adjust the asset side of the balance sheet accordingly.  
So hopefully, you know, with time we’ll may see assets come down, wholesale funding comes down, customer deposits go up and we’ll build the asset side of the balance see in accordance to the size of that space.

And also actually, you know, quite an impressive march from where it had been if you look back over the last six quarters or so to where it is today.  As I said, in the opening commentary, our expectation is we’ll strive hard to maintain it.  I’d like to say we’ll try hard to improve upon it to get into the single digits, but it’s a big deal when you have 2.7 million brokerage accounts, every 1% is a lot of accounts if you think about it in essentially the merit terms.  If you think about 1%, it’s 27,000 accounts, how much we spend to get 27,000 accounts.

Second to your point, we have a sizable amount of high-priced debt out in the marketplace and if we could retire some of that debt, that would be a good thing because we spend pretty close to $170 million or so a year servicing that debt, which was brought on largely when the company was stressed and needed to be recapped.

On the RAA business, it hasn’t been a business that we’ve been in in the past.  Our business model really has been one that’s direct to the customer.  And so not disagreeing that it’s a fast or growing segment of the broader industry, it just hasn’t been an area that we’ve pursued.  So it’s something that, again, we would consider but in a world of prioritization, it’s not high on our list of priorities at least over the near-to-intermediate term.  
In contrast, for example, we would much prefer to rev up or Corporate Services group and grow more rapidly there than basically enter an area that is costly to enter and will take a long time in our view to get out of it profitability.  So we just have to be conscious, not only of the opportunity but the cost of entering and what our alternatives are.  And again, because it wasn’t central to the business model overtime, I’ll never say never, but I don’t want to mislead anybody to say that we’re going to jump into that area.  
From the standpoint of managed investment products and the like, I’ll let Mike comment on that as to what we have in the marketplace, how we basically have distributed those products and what some of the near-term opportunities are in that particular space as we try to base service both the investment needs of our clients in addition to what we historically have done which has been predominately the trading needs of our clients.

To begin this afternoon's call, I will cover highlights from the third quarter and then Bruce will take you through the results. From there, I'll share some thoughts on the opportunities we see for the business, after which, we will be happy to take your questions.
The third quarter was an important one for E*TRADE as we delivered our second consecutive quarterly profit. We reported pretax income of $36 million and achieved positive net income for the quarter despite an unusually high reported tax rate. Strength in a number of areas supported our performance in a quarter that was notable for the industry-wide decline in trading activity and a challenging interest rate environment. We were pleased with the growth in net new assets and average margin receivables and the quality of new accounts in the brokerage business. Improvement in both those trends drove the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in our loan loss provision. Effective balance sheet strategies resulted in solid net interest income and we benefited from opportunistic gains in our securities portfolio.
Our results demonstrated progress in positioning the company for sustainable profitability and growth as we continued to execute on a number of key objectives. Our provision for loan losses has been below charge-offs for five consecutive quarters. We have generated organic bank regulatory capital each quarter this year and we have delivered our second consecutive profitable quarter. During the quarter, we executed on a number of initiatives to expand our offering to both active traders and long-term investors. In June, we released application programming interface, or API, allowing third party vendors and independent software developers to interface seamlessly with our investing platform. In September, we introduced new research and trade idea generation tools, including market commentary from Dreyfus and Buzz & Banter from Minyanville, a leading business and finance site. 
Also in September, we launched a new cross media ad campaign including TV spots that are running during highly-rated fall sporting events and primetime programming. The campaign, with a new tagline, ""Investing Unleashed,"" includes several new E*TRADE baby spots as well as product ads that speak directly to self-directed investors who are ready to take control of their finances. It is a high-impact campaign that moves the brand forward and positions us well for the fourth quarter, as well as 2011. In addition, our ongoing investment in the overall customer experience, including a growing relationship management team and simplified pricing, continues to pay off. This supported a sequential improvement in our annualized brokerage account attrition rate from 13% to 10%, our lowest attrition rate in more than six years and a level we will strive to sustain over the long run. 
We also received industry recognition for our corporate services organization from Group 5, a leader in equity compensation research, which named us number one in overall satisfaction and loyalty for Stock Plan administration in its 10th annual benchmarking survey. Our Corporate Services group, which provides stock plan administrative tools and services, continues to gain traction and now counts 20% of the S&P 500 as clients. This continues to be an attractive opportunity for us, both as a standalone business and as a meaningful source of new retail brokerage accounts. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through our results for the quarter."

While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio and solid net interest income. We rep",1203,"Thank you, Steve. While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio and solid net interest income. We reported net income of $8 million or $0.03 per share during the third quarter, which compares with net income of $35 million or $0.12 per share in the prior quarter and a net loss of $855 million or $6.74 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Our third quarter 2009 results included a non-cash charge on debt exchange of $773 million or $6.09 per share. When excluding the impact of the debt exchange, we had a net loss of $82 million or $0.65 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
We reported pretax income of $36 million for the quarter. But as Steve noted, we had an unusually high reported tax rate this quarter. So let me explain. Although our actual tax rate continues to be approximately 38%, our reported tax rate is much higher because certain of our expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. For example, and most importantly, about 1/3 of our interest expense on the Springing Lien Notes is not deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, while our reported pretax income is $36 million, our income subject to taxation is higher, resulting this quarter in a much higher reported tax rate of 76%. This is due not only to the higher amount of taxable income but also to the fact that our reported pretax income for the year is relatively close to break even. The additional pretax income from the Springing Lien Notes is about $35 million per year and the annual tax on that income is about $10 million. Therefore, this issue will be mitigated if our reported pretax income grows in the future.
We produced $489 million of net revenue during the quarter, a decline of $45 million from the prior quarter and down $86 million or 15% from the same quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue was driven almost entirely by the decrease in trading activity as was experienced across the industry. We were pleased to maintain a relatively consistent level of interest income of $299 million. The $3 million decline from the prior quarter reflected a $1.3 billion decrease in average interest earning assets to $39.7 billion, which was largely offset by a six basis-point expansion and net interest spread to 2.95%. This reflects our strategy of maintaining a relatively consistent net interest spread despite an environment of declining interest rates.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the third quarter were $151 million. This was down 23% compared with the prior quarter and was impacted by the decline in DARTs and a very slight decline in average commission per trade from $11.05 to $11.03. Our revenue this quarter also included $40 million of net gains in loans and securities, including a net impairment of $7 million, as we managed our investment portfolio to limit our risk and we realized gains due to favorable market opportunities. This compares with $37 million of net gains in the second quarter and $23 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Our total operating expense for the third quarter declined 3% or $9 million from the prior quarter to $267 million, which represented a 12% decline from the third quarter of 2009. This included lower compensation and clearing expense as well as a $6 million credit against professional service fees as part of a legal settlement.
Let's turn now to metrics. As noted, we experienced a slowdown in trading activity over the summer, certainly in comparison to record highs in recent years. DARTs for the third quarter were $127,000, down 26% from the prior quarter and down 30% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, we saw strength in a number of areas. Net new asset flows into our brokerage business were a positive $1.4 billion during the quarter and totaled $5.7 billion year-to-date. Net new brokerage accounts were 7,000, bringing account growth for the year to 27,000 and we ended the quarter with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts. 
Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.9 billion to $22.6 billion while customers were net sellers of $1.3 billion in securities. Bank customer cash declined by $600 million. In total, we experienced a net increase of $1.3 billion of customer cash deposits, which was a positive contributor to our net interest income. Another positive contributor was increased margin loans to customers. Average margin receivables grew by 4% during the quarter from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. This represented a 52% increase from a year ago. 
We were pleased with the performance of our loan portfolio. The portfolio contracted by $1 billion during the quarter and our loan loss provision declined from $166 million in the second quarter to $152 million in the third quarter. This is the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in the provision, which is now 71% below its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Loan charge-offs declined slightly from $225 million in the second quarter to $222 million in the third quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline and charge-offs are now 43% below their peak of $386 million in the second quarter of 2009. The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $1 billion, down $70 million from the prior quarter and remains at 6% of gross loans receivable.
We expect that credit cost will continue to decline. However, because the timing and magnitude of the improvement is affected by many factors, we anticipate variability in any one quarter while continuing to see a downward trend over the long term. Related to the recent decisions by a number of banks to suspend or review their foreclosure programs, we do not expect any material direct impact although we may be indirectly affected as any delays work their way through the system. As a reminder, E*TRADE does not service any of its loan portfolio and we rely exclusively on third-party services. 
We are pleased that the Bank generated capital again this quarter. The Bank generated $81 million in regulatory risk-based capital, bringing the year-to-date total to $191 million. As of September 30, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.41% to total adjusted assets and 13.75% to risk-weighted assets. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of risk-based total capital, in excess of the level that our regulators define as well capitalized.
On a consolidated basis, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in Tier 1 capital and our tangible common equity was $2.1 billion, both slightly higher than second quarter levels. We ended the quarter with $490 million in corporate cash. This is an increase of approximately $9 million from the prior quarter and included a $34 million dividend from the Bank. 
Finally, I want to note that our corporate interest income this quarter benefited by $6 million from a legal settlement. In all, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter and look forward to building on our momentum. And with that, I will the turn the call back to Steve for additional remarks."

Before opening the call for questions, I would like to share a few comments related to future plans and initiatives. When we spoke last quarter, I had been on board approximately 100 days and we had just reported our first quarter of profitability in three years. The company has achieved a number of important milestones, allowing us to shift gears from defense to offense and providing the flexibility to review opportunities for future growth. 
We seem to have focused on areas where we see potential for driving enhanced growth and profitability and we'll highlight four categories: First, we have a solid retail brokered franchise that has performed extremely well throughout its history, most recently contributing great results that were often overshadowed by challenges in the loan portfolio. With a base of all-time high 2.7 million brokered accounts, complemented by an enhanced marketing spend, we believe there are continued opportunities to expand our relationship, sales, product and service initiatives to grow our active trader and long-term investor customer bases. Our growing sales force will emphasize long-term investor retirement solutions including the advisor-based management investment portfolios as well as a full suite of fund and fixed income brokerage product offerings. 
We'll also continue to expand our offering for active traders and are in the early launch phase of portfolio margining three- or four-legged option spreads, E*TRADE communities and additions to our mobile trading application, specifically E*TRADE Mobile Pro for Android. On the marketing side as I mentioned earlier, we have been evolving our advertising to include product and service focus messaging in addition to iconic E*TRADE Baby. And we believe we have a terrific opportunity to better engage with the 15 million prospects that visit our website each year. 
Second, we have significant institutional brokerage opportunities, notably our Corporate Services and Capital Markets groups. Both of these businesses have scale and are market leaders. Our Corporate Services group continues to make progress with new and expanded businesses in both software and services and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts. Our Capital Markets group also provides a strong foundation for organic growth in our market-making activities. We are competing effectively and acquiring more external order flow and we'll continue to ensure we are extracting maximum economic benefit from our retail customer engagement. 
Third, as we continue to expand our wealth management offering for long-term investors via existing sales and service channels, we will leverage our heritage of innovation with an eye towards delivering value propositions that redefine the customer experience for self-directed investors. E*TRADE was a pioneer in online trading and we believe that we have an opportunity to play a similar role in online investing, as customer needs and technologies evolve. 
Finally, we believe our Bank can play an important role in helping us to optimize the value of our very large and stable brokerage customer deposit base. With a focus on these four areas, which build on our current strengths and in many cases, existing assets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We are actively executing against these growth strategies and we'll keep you informed on our progress.
As we do this, I assure you that we will remain intensely focused on flawless execution and rigorous expense management. I am gratified to see the energy across the organization as we seize the growth opportunities that lie ahead for E*TRADE. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

First, we agree that our preference is to have a basically distinctive upward slope on the yield curve and it elevates the level of rates, which really has been part of the challenge which Bruce alluded to during the quarter. That said, we've done several things that help maintain basically the net interest margin. In fact, improve the net interest margin during the period. First, which I think is strategic for us, we continue to basically grow our margin book, which is actually important. Second, we basically have the opportunity that we've executed on to deploy investment strategies and keep cash at a lower level that we might have otherwise but sufficient to run our businesses. So cash basically earning very little in the overall business. And finally, we have had the opportunity to basically invest, as you know, in agency-backed securities, which is essentially where we invest our excess as the legacy loan portfolios come down and I think basically our treasury area has played essentially that role basically smartly and have done very well in that pursuit. Bruce said on the call three months back that we would strive to keep net interest margin in roughly the 300 basis-point range. Obviously, there's no precision around 300 but we would say with a level of confidence that we will maintain it within that range, plus or minus. But we strive to stay relatively neutral on rate moves in either direction."

So we are actually overall very pleased with the performance of delinquencies over this year. I think total special mention, including both first lien and home equity, are down in the neighborhood of 25%. You are right, the improvement more recently in home equity has been flatter than first lien, that we expected because our first lien portfolio was less seasoned so it took a longer time for some of the poorer credits to run through there. But where we are now is still believing that we're within this long-term trend, but there will be variability from month-to-month. So you're right, in September there was what I would call a fairly modest uptick. But if you look over the past four, five or six months, the trend has been flattish to down. So I don't think that'll change but we think the rate of improvement, particularly the home equity would probably be more moderate."

I think simplifying our pricing, basically taking off inactivity fees. But I think more importantly, when we measure essentially the service satisfaction of our client base that's been on basically a constantly improving trend. Net promoter scores, which essentially is how people feel not only about the firm but willingness to recommend us to others, that's been improving as well. Plus we've been enhancing both product as well as the utility, which is our platform. I think it's really kind of the aggregation of all those pieces that have brought the attrition rate down to what it has been a goal for the company. And also, actually, quite I think an impressive March from where it had been if you look back over the last I would say six quarters or so to where it is today. As I said in the opening commentary, our expectation is we'll strive hard to maintain it. I'd like to say is we'll try hard to improve upon it to get into the single digits. But it's a big deal when you have 2.7 million brokerage accounts, every 1% is a lot of accounts. Think about it in essentially numeric terms. If you think about 1%, it's 27,000 accounts. How much we'd spend to get 27,000 accounts. So what we're trying to operate on not only is the front end, bringing on new customers, but bringing on new customers really maintaining the relationship we have with our existing customers and importantly, broadening out the relationship we have with existing customers so that we could help them further and we could derive more benefit as they derive basically more utility from what we offer. But it's all wrapped together."

Second to your point, we have a sizable amount of high-priced debt out in the marketplace. And if we could retire some of that debt, that would be a good thing because we spent pretty close to $170 million or so year in servicing that debt, which was brought on largely when the company was stressed and need to be recapped. And then finally, to your point, we would basically look at alternatives including the potential to buy back our own equity or stock. But it will be situational, so when the events occur, it's hard to predict which would have the highest priority.

That's a different issue, and one that we are basically assessing. So simply stated, we have a margin book as we said that's approaching $5 billion but I like it to be twice the size. The answer is yes, we'll be deploying additional product and capability as I mentioned over the coming quarters, hopefully giving us an opportunity to grow that up further. And then taking a step back, the universe that we're quite interested in is largely the one that is the core of our business, the 2.7 million brokerage customers, and we'll assess whether or not.

But in the world of privatization it’s not high on our list of priorities, at least over the intermediate term. In contrast, for example, we would much prefer to rev up our corporate services group and grow more rapidly there, than basically enter an area that is costly to enter and will take a long time in our view to get aggregate profitability. So we just have to be conscious not only of the opportunity but the cost of entry, and what our alternatives are.

To begin this afternoon's call, I will cover highlights from the third quarter and then Bruce will take you through the results. From there, I'll share some thoughts on the opportunities we see for the business, after which, we will be happy to take your questions.
The third quarter was an important one for E*TRADE as we delivered our second consecutive quarterly profit. We reported pretax income of $36 million and achieved positive net income for the quarter despite an unusually high reported tax rate. Strength in a number of areas supported our performance in a quarter that was notable for the industry-wide decline in trading activity and a challenging interest rate environment. We were pleased with the growth in net new assets and average margin receivables and the quality of new accounts in the brokerage business. Improvement in both those trends drove the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in our loan loss provision. Effective balance sheet strategies resulted in solid net interest income and we benefited from opportunistic gains in our securities portfolio.
Our results demonstrated progress in positioning the company for sustainable profitability and growth as we continued to execute on a number of key objectives. Our provision for loan losses has been below charge-offs for five consecutive quarters. We have generated organic bank regulatory capital each quarter this year and we have delivered our second consecutive profitable quarter. During the quarter, we executed on a number of initiatives to expand our offering to both active traders and long-term investors. In June, we released application programming interface, or API, allowing third party vendors and independent software developers to interface seamlessly with our investing platform. In September, we introduced new research and trade idea generation tools, including market commentary from Dreyfus and Buzz & Banter from Minyanville, a leading business and finance site. 
Also in September, we launched a new cross media ad campaign including TV spots that are running during highly-rated fall sporting events and primetime programming. The campaign, with a new tagline, ""Investing Unleashed,"" includes several new E*TRADE baby spots as well as product ads that speak directly to self-directed investors who are ready to take control of their finances. It is a high-impact campaign that moves the brand forward and positions us well for the fourth quarter, as well as 2011. In addition, our ongoing investment in the overall customer experience, including a growing relationship management team and simplified pricing, continues to pay off. This supported a sequential improvement in our annualized brokerage account attrition rate from 13% to 10%, our lowest attrition rate in more than six years and a level we will strive to sustain over the long run. 
We also received industry recognition for our corporate services organization from Group 5, a leader in equity compensation research, which named us number one in overall satisfaction and loyalty for Stock Plan administration in its 10th annual benchmarking survey. Our Corporate Services group, which provides stock plan administrative tools and services, continues to gain traction and now counts 20% of the S&P 500 as clients. This continues to be an attractive opportunity for us, both as a standalone business and as a meaningful source of new retail brokerage accounts. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce to take you through our results for the quarter."
27807,114166008,80792,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Steve. While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio and solid net interest income. We rep",1203,"Thank you, Steve. While we were affected by the decline in overall trading, we were pleased with our results, which were supported by strength in our brokerage business, continued positive trends in our loan portfolio and solid net interest income. We reported net income of $8 million or $0.03 per share during the third quarter, which compares with net income of $35 million or $0.12 per share in the prior quarter and a net loss of $855 million or $6.74 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Our third quarter 2009 results included a non-cash charge on debt exchange of $773 million or $6.09 per share. When excluding the impact of the debt exchange, we had a net loss of $82 million or $0.65 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
We reported pretax income of $36 million for the quarter. But as Steve noted, we had an unusually high reported tax rate this quarter. So let me explain. Although our actual tax rate continues to be approximately 38%, our reported tax rate is much higher because certain of our expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. For example, and most importantly, about 1/3 of our interest expense on the Springing Lien Notes is not deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, while our reported pretax income is $36 million, our income subject to taxation is higher, resulting this quarter in a much higher reported tax rate of 76%. This is due not only to the higher amount of taxable income but also to the fact that our reported pretax income for the year is relatively close to break even. The additional pretax income from the Springing Lien Notes is about $35 million per year and the annual tax on that income is about $10 million. Therefore, this issue will be mitigated if our reported pretax income grows in the future.
We produced $489 million of net revenue during the quarter, a decline of $45 million from the prior quarter and down $86 million or 15% from the same quarter a year ago. The decline in revenue was driven almost entirely by the decrease in trading activity as was experienced across the industry. We were pleased to maintain a relatively consistent level of interest income of $299 million. The $3 million decline from the prior quarter reflected a $1.3 billion decrease in average interest earning assets to $39.7 billion, which was largely offset by a six basis-point expansion and net interest spread to 2.95%. This reflects our strategy of maintaining a relatively consistent net interest spread despite an environment of declining interest rates.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the third quarter were $151 million. This was down 23% compared with the prior quarter and was impacted by the decline in DARTs and a very slight decline in average commission per trade from $11.05 to $11.03. Our revenue this quarter also included $40 million of net gains in loans and securities, including a net impairment of $7 million, as we managed our investment portfolio to limit our risk and we realized gains due to favorable market opportunities. This compares with $37 million of net gains in the second quarter and $23 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Our total operating expense for the third quarter declined 3% or $9 million from the prior quarter to $267 million, which represented a 12% decline from the third quarter of 2009. This included lower compensation and clearing expense as well as a $6 million credit against professional service fees as part of a legal settlement.
Let's turn now to metrics. As noted, we experienced a slowdown in trading activity over the summer, certainly in comparison to record highs in recent years. DARTs for the third quarter were $127,000, down 26% from the prior quarter and down 30% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, we saw strength in a number of areas. Net new asset flows into our brokerage business were a positive $1.4 billion during the quarter and totaled $5.7 billion year-to-date. Net new brokerage accounts were 7,000, bringing account growth for the year to 27,000 and we ended the quarter with a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts. 
Brokerage customer cash increased by $1.9 billion to $22.6 billion while customers were net sellers of $1.3 billion in securities. Bank customer cash declined by $600 million. In total, we experienced a net increase of $1.3 billion of customer cash deposits, which was a positive contributor to our net interest income. Another positive contributor was increased margin loans to customers. Average margin receivables grew by 4% during the quarter from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. This represented a 52% increase from a year ago. 
We were pleased with the performance of our loan portfolio. The portfolio contracted by $1 billion during the quarter and our loan loss provision declined from $166 million in the second quarter to $152 million in the third quarter. This is the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in the provision, which is now 71% below its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Loan charge-offs declined slightly from $225 million in the second quarter to $222 million in the third quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline and charge-offs are now 43% below their peak of $386 million in the second quarter of 2009. The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $1 billion, down $70 million from the prior quarter and remains at 6% of gross loans receivable.
We expect that credit cost will continue to decline. However, because the timing and magnitude of the improvement is affected by many factors, we anticipate variability in any one quarter while continuing to see a downward trend over the long term. Related to the recent decisions by a number of banks to suspend or review their foreclosure programs, we do not expect any material direct impact although we may be indirectly affected as any delays work their way through the system. As a reminder, E*TRADE does not service any of its loan portfolio and we rely exclusively on third-party services. 
We are pleased that the Bank generated capital again this quarter. The Bank generated $81 million in regulatory risk-based capital, bringing the year-to-date total to $191 million. As of September 30, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.41% to total adjusted assets and 13.75% to risk-weighted assets. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of risk-based total capital, in excess of the level that our regulators define as well capitalized.
On a consolidated basis, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in Tier 1 capital and our tangible common equity was $2.1 billion, both slightly higher than second quarter levels. We ended the quarter with $490 million in corporate cash. This is an increase of approximately $9 million from the prior quarter and included a $34 million dividend from the Bank. 
Finally, I want to note that our corporate interest income this quarter benefited by $6 million from a legal settlement. In all, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter and look forward to building on our momentum. And with that, I will the turn the call back to Steve for additional remarks."

Before opening the call for questions, I would like to share a few comments related to future plans and initiatives. When we spoke last quarter, I had been on board approximately 100 days and we had just reported our first quarter of profitability in three years. The company has achieved a number of important milestones, allowing us to shift gears from defense to offense and providing the flexibility to review opportunities for future growth. 
We seem to have focused on areas where we see potential for driving enhanced growth and profitability and we'll highlight four categories: First, we have a solid retail brokered franchise that has performed extremely well throughout its history, most recently contributing great results that were often overshadowed by challenges in the loan portfolio. With a base of all-time high 2.7 million brokered accounts, complemented by an enhanced marketing spend, we believe there are continued opportunities to expand our relationship, sales, product and service initiatives to grow our active trader and long-term investor customer bases. Our growing sales force will emphasize long-term investor retirement solutions including the advisor-based management investment portfolios as well as a full suite of fund and fixed income brokerage product offerings. 
We'll also continue to expand our offering for active traders and are in the early launch phase of portfolio margining three- or four-legged option spreads, E*TRADE communities and additions to our mobile trading application, specifically E*TRADE Mobile Pro for Android. On the marketing side as I mentioned earlier, we have been evolving our advertising to include product and service focus messaging in addition to iconic E*TRADE Baby. And we believe we have a terrific opportunity to better engage with the 15 million prospects that visit our website each year. 
Second, we have significant institutional brokerage opportunities, notably our Corporate Services and Capital Markets groups. Both of these businesses have scale and are market leaders. Our Corporate Services group continues to make progress with new and expanded businesses in both software and services and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts. Our Capital Markets group also provides a strong foundation for organic growth in our market-making activities. We are competing effectively and acquiring more external order flow and we'll continue to ensure we are extracting maximum economic benefit from our retail customer engagement. 
Third, as we continue to expand our wealth management offering for long-term investors via existing sales and service channels, we will leverage our heritage of innovation with an eye towards delivering value propositions that redefine the customer experience for self-directed investors. E*TRADE was a pioneer in online trading and we believe that we have an opportunity to play a similar role in online investing, as customer needs and technologies evolve. 
Finally, we believe our Bank can play an important role in helping us to optimize the value of our very large and stable brokerage customer deposit base. With a focus on these four areas, which build on our current strengths and in many cases, existing assets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We are actively executing against these growth strategies and we'll keep you informed on our progress.
As we do this, I assure you that we will remain intensely focused on flawless execution and rigorous expense management. I am gratified to see the energy across the organization as we seize the growth opportunities that lie ahead for E*TRADE. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

First, we agree that our preference is to have a basically distinctive upward slope on the yield curve and it elevates the level of rates, which really has been part of the challenge which Bruce alluded to during the quarter. That said, we've done several things that help maintain basically the net interest margin. In fact, improve the net interest margin during the period. First, which I think is strategic for us, we continue to basically grow our margin book, which is actually important. Second, we basically have the opportunity that we've executed on to deploy investment strategies and keep cash at a lower level that we might have otherwise but sufficient to run our businesses. So cash basically earning very little in the overall business. And finally, we have had the opportunity to basically invest, as you know, in agency-backed securities, which is essentially where we invest our excess as the legacy loan portfolios come down and I think basically our treasury area has played essentially that role basically smartly and have done very well in that pursuit. Bruce said on the call three months back that we would strive to keep net interest margin in roughly the 300 basis-point range. Obviously, there's no precision around 300 but we would say with a level of confidence that we will maintain it within that range, plus or minus. But we strive to stay relatively neutral on rate moves in either direction."

Let me answer that. Broader volumes is that we have, since my arrival, done segmentation work on what could be described as good bank, bad bank, and without going through detail, either analysis or numbers, as expected embedded in the roughly $17 billion legacy portfolio, there are a large number of customers of E*TRADE that have very good profiles, both from the standpoint of how they look on their own basically set of either I would say FICO demographic and other. In addition to that, they've had basically consistent level of payment history with us and there's absolutely nothing wrong with them. And if we had a choice, we'd rather maintain them longer than shorter.

I think total special mention, including both first lien and home equity, are down in the neighborhood of 25%. You are right, the improvement more recently in home equity has been flatter than first lien, that we expected because our first lien portfolio was less seasoned so it took a longer time for some of the poorer credits to run through there. But where we are now is still believing that we're within this long-term trend, but there will be variability from month-to-month. So you're right, in September there was what I would call a fairly modest uptick. But if you look over the past four, five or six months, the trend has been flattish to down. So I don't think that'll change but we think the rate of improvement, particularly the home equity would probably be more moderate."

That said, as those deposits grow and they have been growing, we probably will diminish, which is what we have been doing as well, continue to do as wholesale funding and, hopefully, we will grow the business.

There are two columns, one is the specific allowance as a percentage of the loans, and one is the total expected loss. The difference between those two numbers is due to the fact that at 180 days past due, you write all of our loans down to expected recovery value. So basically, the difference between those columns is that the penultimate column, the specific valuation represents the reserve we have for the remaining losses we expect to take on those loans. And that allowance we do believe is sufficient to cover those losses."

The business that E*TRADE has been in, which is predominantly the purchase of full loans and securities, is a business that we would not reenter. Definitively, we'd not reenter. Other than qualify, agency-backed MBS is fine. From the standpoint more broadly, would we like to lend money to our high-quality brokerage customers? That's a different issue, and one that we are basically assessing. So simply stated, we have a margin book as we said that's approaching $5 billion but I like it to be twice the size. The answer is yes, we'll be deploying additional product and capability as I mentioned over the coming quarters, hopefully giving us an opportunity to grow that up further. And then taking a step back, the universe that we're quite interested in is largely the one that is the core of our business, the 2.7 million brokerage customers, and we'll assess whether or not. We're not saying we would but we'll assess whether or not that is a business that we want to enter. If we would enter the lending business, it would be very much focused on that client base, which is a very different animal from where we've come. Expectation being a relational-oriented based business to a high quality basic customer could provide us an opportunity but it's something that we're thinking about but we don't have specific plans to pursue."

On the RAA business, it hasn't been a business that we've been in, in the past and our business model really has been one that's direct to the customer. And so not disagreeing but it's a fast or growing segment of the broader industry. It just hasn't been an area that we've pursued. So it's something that again, we would consider. But in the world of privatization it’s not high on our list of priorities, at least over the intermediate term. In contrast, for example, we would much prefer to rev up our corporate services group and grow more rapidly there, than basically enter an area that is costly to enter and will take a long time in our view to get aggregate profitability. So we just have to be conscious not only of the opportunity but the cost of entry, and what our alternatives are. And again, because it wasn't central to the business model over time, I'll never say never, but I don't want to mislead anybody to say that we're going to jump into that area. From the standpoint of the managed investment products and the like, I'll let Mike comment on that as to what we have in the marketplace, how we basically have distributed those products and what some of the near-term opportunities are in that particular space as we tried to basically service both the investment needs of our clients in addition to what we’ve historically done, which has been predominantly the trading needs of our clients."

We have been very aggressive since 2007 in putting back loans to customers. We put back about $263 million of loans so far. Obviously as the portfolio ages, our opportunity to put those loans back becomes somewhat smaller. But we continue to work with the original sellers to put back loans to them. We've done about $40 million this year. So it is falling down. But at the same time, we are also talking to a variety of original sellers about settlements of that right, and there's some opportunity there. In terms of who the sellers were, it really cuts across all of the people that were heavy originators of loans during that period. And so there's no particular concentration in any one originator. It really is pretty indicative of the market during those years."
