This business cycle's trough in 2009 revealed the benefits of the transformation process we began back in 2004. ATI was profitable in 2009 in spite of the most challenging recession in nearly 75 years. This was accomplished with capacity utilization across our facilities of 50% to 55%. We continue to improve our cost structure with nearly $173 million of gross cost reductions. ATI ended the year with a strong balance sheet and nearly $709 million of cash on hand. We continue to make important, strategic self-funded investments, and our U.S. defined pension plan is essentially fully funded. Our safety performance continue to be world class. We brought on new assets to provide new capabilities and further improved our cost structure. Our new titanium and super alloy forging facility in Bakers, North Carolina was completed on time and under budget. We're beginning to realize a significantly improved technical capabilities and improved cost structure from this new facility.Our new premium titanium sponge facility in Raleigh, Utah started out at the end of 2009. I visited the facility last week and reviewed its initial production. As the processes are optimized and standardized, we plan to ramp production in a systematic way that consistently provides the best possible quality and cost competitive product from this new facility. At our ATI Wah Chang operations, we're doubling the capacity of our reactor grade zirconium sponge, preparing for increased demand from the global nuclear energy market. We believe ATI is now the world's largest producer of critical reactor grade zirconium sponge for the nuclear energy market. We nearly tripled the capacity of our STAL Precision Rolled Strip joint venture operating in China. STAL is now much better positioned to benefit from China's electronics and telecommunications manufacturing market for cell phones and smartphones, as well as China's rapidly growing automotive parts manufacturing market. Again, we believe we're the largest producer of these thin strip products in China. We believe our new facility gives us a significant competitive advantage in this growing market. We continue to improve our position with our key customers and expanded our market, product and global diversification. We signed several important long-term agreements in 2009 in the aerospace, oil and gas, electrical energy and medical markets. The trend continues in 2010. We're seeing interest for our zirconium products for the nuclear energy market and expect to be able to make other announcements soon. Our industry-leading technology portfolio continued to expand and we continue to make important R&D investments in 2009. Our new products are gaining traction in the marketplace. We are particularly pleased with the acceptance of ATI 425 alloy, an innovative new titanium alloy, ATI 718Plus alloy, our groundbreaking nickel-based super alloy and our ATI 500-MIL alloy, which is the first new armor plate product released to the market in over 40 years. These products are aimed at improving, manufacturability to help customers get to near net shape quicker and at reduced costs. Our new duplex stainless alloys used lower amounts of nickel and/or moly [molybdenum]. These products are designed to be more cost effective and typically provide higher strength and better corrosion resistance than conventional stainless alloys. We added advanced powder metals to our wide array of high-end products by creating ATI Powder Metals, after our October 2009 acquisition of Powder Metals assets. Improved fuel efficiency standards and green initiatives are driving jet engines operating temperatures to higher levels. With the addition of ATI Powder Metals, we have expanded our product breadth for the next generation of jet engines. Direct international sales reached over 31% of sales in 2009. We strengthened our position in Europe, Asia, Canada, South America and the Middle East. Today, ATI is more globally focused than at any time in our history. We expect this trend to continue as a result of customer focused sales and marketing efforts, which we expect to be further aided by the historically weak dollar. We remain optimistic about the secular growth trends of the global aerospace and infrastructure markets. Of note, ATI's export/import balance was nearly $350 million positive. This outcome supports another benefit of our American-based manufacturing strategy. As we have said, we believe a U.S. manufacturer can compete in the global economy. To be globally competitive, ATI must have the most advanced specialty metals technology coupled with unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities.Our strategic emphasis on high-value products continues. 2009 sales of our high-value products were nearly 78% of ATI sales. Of note, shipments of titanium and titanium alloys, which include the Uniti joint venture products produced by ATI were approximately 34 million pounds in 2009, down 28% compared to 2008. Fourth quarter shipments were 6.8 million pounds. Orders and inquiry levels have improved during the fourth quarter from the aerospace, defense and industrial markets. So we expect increased titanium product shipments in 2010 compared to 2009. 73% of our 2009 sales were to our core global markets. We remain confident in the intermediate and long-term secular growth potential of these markets. Aerospace and defense accounted for 31% of sales, electrical energy was 19% of sales, the chemical processing industry, oil and gas markets accounted for 19% of sales and the medical markets accounted for 4% of sales.Defense was a growth market for ATI in 2009. Not many metals companies can report they had a growth market last year. This accomplishment further reveals our ability to move our periscope to key markets particularly to markets where ATI has traditionally been underrepresented. The defense market for armored vehicles and naval structures provides ATI with new growth opportunities. These are outside of the traditional military aircraft applications and utilize our titanium alloys, special alloys and engineered products.  We entered 2009 with a goal to come out of this recession with an even stronger and better company. We believe this goal was accomplished and our direction and vision have remained intact. Fourth quarter 2009 was by far, our best quarter of the year as we began to see modest recovery in many of our markets. ATI are in $0.36 a share in the fourth quarter on 108 million shares outstanding. Comparing fourth quarter 2009 to third quarter 2009 performance, ATI sales improved by nearly 17%. In our High Performance Metals segment, shipments of our titanium-based alloys declined 5%. However, we believe the titanium supply chain bottomed in the fourth quarter. It has now begun to recover, as demand going forward is expected to be more in line with the projected aircraft build rates, particularly for new jet engines and for the jet engine aftermarket. Demand for nickel-based super alloys and specialty alloys is up 21% primarily as the jet engine supply chain adjusted to production schedules. Shipments of our exotic alloys increased by 34% due to growing demand for the nuclear energy market and shipments for chemical process industry projects.In our Flat-Rolled Products segment, fourth quarter 2009 shipments of our highest value Flat-Rolled Products increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Here are some highlights. Shipments of Precision Rolled Strip products improved by over 13%, demand continued to improve for nearly all end users for this product and we are beginning to see benefits from our STAL expansion in China. Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel products to the global electrical energy market increased 4%. Shipments of our flat-rolled nickel alloys and specialty stainless alloys increased 13% largely due to increased project activity in the oil and gas market. Fourth quarter shipments of our flat-rolled titanium products, including the Uniti conversion improved by 7%. This 7% is in contrast to the 5% decline in the High Performance Metals section. Fourth quarter 2009 shipments of our standard stainless sheet and plate products were essentially flat compared to the third quarter 2009. However, average price for these products increased 22% due to higher raw material surcharges and improved base prices.Our Engineered Products segment swung to a fourth quarter operating profit from a loss in each of the first three quarters of 2009. As we saw general improvement in many markets, particularly in the oil and gas market as demand increased for our tungsten and forged products. In the fourth quarter, ATI earned segment operating profit of over $118 million. This was accomplished on the circumstances, that while improved from the third quarter of 2009 had two significant challenges. ATI was profitable with overall utilization rates of about 55% to 60% across our operations during the fourth quarter. Operating profit was also reduced by $15 million due to startup costs associated with the new facility, idle facility costs and across the company and workforce reduction costs. On the upside, operating profit improved as a result of a LIFO benefit that was $23 million higher than our forecast made at the end of October. Finally, a quick update on our remaining strategic capital projects. The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty metal melt shop is progressing on schedule. We reduced a footprint and we expect considerable cost savings in production efficiencies from this project when it is completed later this year. We expect to begin to benefit from the $20 million to $30 million of annualized cost reductions associated with this project beginning in the second half of 2010. Engineering, permitting and site preparation is nearly completed now on our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania advanced hot rolling and processing facility. We are now in the final vendor selection process. We expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $375 million, down from $454 million in 2009. For the six-year period 2004 through 2009, ATI invested over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures and asset acquisitions to build the most technically advanced manufacturing base in our industry. During the same period, ATI generated over $2.2 billion of operating cash. Our self-funded capital expenditure plan has been working. And as a result, ATI is better positioned for the next phase of growth. Now my closing comment before we take questions. Again for some numbers, we expect 2010 retirement benefit expense, which includes both pension and OPEB [Other Post Employment Benefits] expense to be $90 million or $22.5 million per quarter. This represents a decrease of approximately $32 million as compared to 2009. And we expect most of this 2010 retirement benefit expense to be non-cash. We plan to continue to aggressively improve our cost structure through a targeted program of at least $100 million of new gross cost reductions. At this time, we do not expect any LIFO benefits or expense for the first quarter of 2010.In 2010, we expect to see gradual and steady improvement in most of our markets during the year. Boeing and Airbus have announced that they plan to hold their respective production rates in 2010. This morning, Boeing also announced that they expect to deliver the first few 787s and 747-8 models in late 2010. They expect to deliver several more of these planes in 2011. At some point in 2010, the jet engine supply chain is going to begin to order our metals to build the jet engines for these aircraft.Now moving to the oil and gas market. World rig count began to increase during the fourth quarter of 2009. Offshore projects continue to be engineered and ATI is well positioned to win several major orders. Opportunities are growing for ATI from unconventional gas projects such as LNG and shale gas. On the electrical energy market, we expect shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steels to be about flat with 2009. We're beginning to see improved demand from the global nuclear energy market. We're also beginning to see signs of improvement from other forms of clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal. We expect to benefit from investments in pollution control systems for coal fire plants in Asia, but the U.S. legislative uncertainty has practically frozen domestic fossil fuel projects.In concluding, we think 2009 results demonstrate that we have taken the right actions to make ATI a better company. As a result, we expect to recover and grow faster than our core global markets because we have improved ATI's market position with new customers and expanded long-term arrangements, innovative new products, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities and lower costs and a global focus on key growth markets. We are seeing stabilization and early signs of cyclical recovery in our core markets. On top of that, intermediate and long-term secular trends are occurring in these markets that require more of our advanced alloys than ever before. Lastly, we continue to expand our international and new market segment penetration.Recovering volume and the resulting revenue are the necessary keys to significantly improve financial results for ATI. We are optimistic that 2010 is a year of gradual and steady improvement quarter-on-quarter. We'll now turn our time to questions. So Keisha, may we have the first question."

We like what we saw there in the fourth quarter. Secondly, I think we were pleasantly surprised with the turn of events in our Flat-Rolled Products segment where we're seeing more volume. We're just simply seeing better business conditions. You can debate with the economists whether what kind of a recovery that we might see in this country and global markets, and our business today is not tied to the consumer. Most of our business today is tied to capital projects and infrastructure growth, energy, aerospace and defense kind of markets. Oil and gas, those kind of things, medical markets and we're seeing recovery across the board in these markets. So we're seeing a better first quarter in terms of volume across all of our product lines in all three segments."

Some of our new alloys such as what we call 718Plus alloy is a really great alloy for the newer engines and the next generation. We also liked what we see in this Powder business in qualification. And as you know, we announced last year a major nickel contract with a major supplier in this industry that we have not had a major position with which we do now, which is Rolls-Royce and we also have major positions with General Electric. So growth in any of these engines that bring in new type of challenges for the capability of the engines is right up our alley as to the alloys that we are currently offering this market."

Like how much inventory is out there, sitting there to make these airplanes?"

Boeing has a particular, let's call it a safety stock, because remember, they are the storehouse for all these first-year suppliers of theirs. And I don't think those people have stocked up very much on anything. So that's on the titanium side. On the aeroengine side, I think we have now been through a major burn-off of any excess inventories in the second half of last year. And the reason for that, is there was some type of a disconnect between -- -- in my view, between the aeroengine makers and the airframers, as to exactly how many airplanes would be produced in 2010. Everybody seemed to be waiting for a decline in projected requirements. Now that we've passed October, then we passed November, now we past December, there was really no cutbacks. Everybody understands that this aerospace cycle has a plateau to it versus the peak. So, as we go into the second year of plateauing at over 900 airplanes a year, suddenly you've got to build engines. And so we're going to see those engines built. We're going to see pulls on the jet engine side to produce those engines. We're also going to see pulls to produce more engines, new generation engines for the 787, as it begins to ramp up production throughout the qualification period. And you have the 747 and you have you have A380, now going up about double in size. These are of course, big engines that use a lot of material. So we like all of those kind of things. The next question comes to spare parts. Does 2010 have a normal get back to at least, some type of an increase in revenue passenger miles or flights versus a 6% decrease in the United States and some type of a decrease on a worldwide basis. We're going to get back to that 4.5% or 5% growth a year revenue passenger miles. Any improvement when we get to the plus side of that equation is spare parts because it's more time in the air. So my belief is we're going to get to the plus part of that in 2010 as the people that are in the economic chain that are still traveling and feel more confident in their jobs, where they're at in life are going to continue to grow and we have more international travels. So that moves to a plus side. The build rates I stated today hold where they are. I think the supply chain has bottomed out and we're going to see pulls as this goes forward. The second part of that, you're going to see even a possible higher pull, is when the schedules, people start to order and the schedule used to be eight weeks, and then it went to 10 weeks and then it's 12 weeks. And then as soon as they gets to 12 weeks some of them says, not only do I have the problem that I need more material, but I can't get it as fast as I thought I could. And therefore, we're going to see some type of a restocking in addition to the pull."

Those stopped well over a year ago. Boeing, on the other hand, had placed long-term arrangements with certain suppliers for only the titanium side of this aircraft. And my own opinion of that is, it's probably a pretty good strategy when they look at what happens in the titanium markets as demand moves around.

And then we ratably book that throughout the year and update those estimates and forecasts every quarter. And if you look at 2009, we booked in round numbers. We recorded $103 million of a LIFO benefit. That is a reduction in the LIFO reserve. And had we been ahead our crystal ball been absolutely accurate and perfect every quarter, right? We would've booked $25.7 million of LIFO benefit every single quarter. And when you go back and look at how we did in the first two quarters of 2009, we were pretty close to that. We recorded $27.5 million of LIFO income in Q1, $27 million in Q2. And then in Q3, if you remember, what was happening in Q3 was especially on the nickel side and the nickel scrap side, nickel started to run. And we became a little more conservative in forecasting where we thought some of these raw material cost would end up in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we only recorded $4.5 million of LIFO income in Q3. Well, as we then go into the fourth quarter, those raw material cost begin to adjust a little bit, largely back towards the levels that we were assuming earlier in the year. And so we ended up recording $43.8 million of LIFO income in the fourth quarter, which had everything been equal and no changes would've been made, that's about $18 million higher than what we would ended up recording on a purely ratable basis throughout the year. So the train kind of left the track on the commodity markets in the third quarter. We got a little more conservative in our estimates and everything corrected, and so really the third and fourth quarters, the two quarters that got out of whack a little bit. So I guess to your question, how much of the fourth quarter is a true catch up per se? About $18 million pretax. Now, part of that was, I mean quite frankly, when we gave our updated guidance in December, and we moved the guidance to a range of $0.20 to $0.25 a share from what we have previously said in October of the fourth quarter looking more like the third quarter, which was a penny a share. In actuality, a significant part of that of improvement from roughly a penny to the range of $0.20 to $0.25 was due to the LIFO estimate. So for people to conclude that the full improvement in Q4 of $0.20 to $0.25 to $0.36 was all because of LIFO, isn't correct. I mean the vast majority of that LIFO increase was actually reflected in our updated guidance in December."

I think, we have commented in the past that when you look at Albany, that the idle facility cost there is somewhere between $3 million and $4 million a quarter. Most of that is depreciation expense, so it's really non-cash. On the Raleigh side, I think it's going be dependent or probably look similar to the fourth quarter or in that range. We certainly, we'll have more production. But we've got the manning up to a reasonable level there and as we start producing larger quantity, production runs of sponge, obviously some of that won't be thrown off as idle facility cost.

We have to get the first set up and running and see what we get out of that set. And so this is a plant that is the latest and most modern that is in the U.S. And as we look at that, we'll evaluate the quality of the material from the first runs, and we're going to be standardizing and optimizing those runs in the next few weeks. And I would say by the end of February, we'll have several more furnaces up and then March, we'll have several more furnaces up. And by the end of the first half of the year, we'll be fully in operation. Our objective of course in this plant, is to qualify to the highest level of quality, which is rotating quality parts. So now, as we move up, then there's qualifications we have to do. We have to produce X number of pounds of rot product in various forms to be qualified without any kind of problem to the highest standards. So that production out of that plant will be moving to those products, and also moving to markets other than rotating quality until we receive all the qualifications. So I can tell you this, that the plant and the first units is up. We're going to be qualifying that material now. Finishing up on the finishing equipment in the plant, which includes qualifying the shears, qualifying the crushers, qualifying the inspection equipment. But basically, we have the control systems of the plant. If you run one unit, you can run all the units. So, that's up and running. If you got the water system on the run, one you can run all the units. If you've got the electrical power units after run one, you can run all the units. So the plant is up and running. We're going to stage the startup and at this point in time, I would expect that we'll be getting the plant to its full production levels as planned by the middle of the year."

348893,100778649,58193,"Allegheny Technologies Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ATI Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward.Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples",2505,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward.
Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples to apples, earnings were up from last quarter's $0.10 per share, excluding $0.26 of positive LIFO to $0.24 per share without the healthcare legislation charge or 140%.
Shipments most of our products increased, the one exception being exotic alloys, in many cases by double digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
More importantly, overall order receipts were up significantly causing lead times to extend by an additional two to eight weeks for high performance metals, again, exotic alloys being the exception.
Asset utilization rates increased throughout the first quarter with the highest utilization being in March. These are all signs that we are recovering from the global contraction that impacted our business in 2009.
In our business, recovery begins with volume, which improves capacity utilization. We are seeing continued positive signs, recovery and improving volume. Second quarter production schedules are basically booked full at our current utilization rates. Lead times are extending and scrap is in short supply.
Based on these continued market conditions, we believe there may be opportunities for improving base prices in the second half of 2010 as the business cycle continues to recover.
Raw material surcharges for the second quarter shipments will be higher due to rising material costs. However, in our flat roll product segment, base prices for many products, particularly stainless sheet plate, remain low because of these rapidly rising materials surcharges.
The customer's total transaction price is up, but the base or conversion price is still very low. We believe we can see some moderation of raw material prices, coupled with increasing base prices in the second half of 2010.
These are all signs that a true business cycle recovery is underway. With steady quarter-on-quarter improvement, we continue to see 2010 as the transition year to resumption of secular growth in our key markets.
One more point, our direct international sales increased to approximately 34% of sales in the first quarter 2010. Today, ATI is more globally focused than ever before. A particularly important note, our flat-roll product segment achieved record 35% of direct international sales in the first quarter of 2010.
Our international business is recovering. An example, first quarter 2010 order entry from Asia is more than three times the order level of the first quarter of 2009. Overall, our order book increased throughout the first quarter and continues to grow in the second quarter.
Of note in comment is ATI's total first quarter titanium mill product shipments. This includes our high performance metals plus flat-roll products plus Unity joint venture conversion.
Total titanium mill product shipments for the first three months 2010 were 9.2 million pounds. We now believe we will ship over 40 million pounds of titanium products in 2010. So stay tuned for more as we go forward this market.
Moving to our segments. All figures are comparisons of the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter 2009 since this is the most current indication of cyclical recovery. In our high performance metal segment, shipments of our titanium based alloys increased 17%. Shipments of our nickel-based alloys, superalloys and specialty alloys increased 7%.
This increase follows a 21% improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2009. Jet engine supply chain has begun to recover as demand continues to build.
After reducing inventories in 2009, the supply chain is becoming more in line with current aircraft build rates and increasing after market demand. In addition, the jet engine supply chain appears to be more confident that the aircraft build rates are secure and may increase going forward.
Inquiry rates and orders for our premium titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superbased alloys and specialty alloys point to sustained improvement. Prices for many of our products are now beginning to increase as lead times are extending and this should benefit, again, the second half shipments of 2010.
We are also seeing increased activity from the oil and gas and medical markets. Shipments of our exotic alloys in the first quarter decreased substantially due to delayed but not canceled projects in the defense and chemical processing industries during 2009. We entered 2009 with a strong backlog for our exotic alloys.
After the global financial issues hit, the backlog was worked down over the last year. This is a business that historically lags the economy by about six months both up and down. Order increase for exotic alloys are just now beginning to increase, so we do expect shipments to gradually improve in the second half of 2010.
Operating profit in our high performance metal segment was approximately 22% of sales, excluding the idle facilities and new sponge facility startup cost of nearly $10,000 - $10 million in the first quarter.
Well, this is not where we want to be. So where are we? First, our titanium and nickel-based alloys business did quite well, in market share and volume improvements. On the other hand, our exotic alloys business did not perform anywhere near 2009 levels because of delayed projects and programs.
Operating profit in our high performance metal segment was negatively impacted by $9.9 million of startup and idle facility costs, mostly associated with our Raleigh, Utah plant and the Albany, Oregon titanium sponge facilities.
Lastly, in the high performance metal segment, in our pricing mechanisms, we adjust raw material surcharges at the end of each quarter not during the quarter. So we expect to benefit from higher raw material indices in the second quarter.
Now moving to our flat-roll product segments. First quarter shipments of our high-value flat-roll products increased 12%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Here are some highlights.
Shipments of our engineered and precision roll strip products improved 15%. Demand is recovering from the global automotive market. In the construction market, orders reached near historic highs for high efficiency gas furnaces.
There's some stimulus money. Demand from the aerospace and electronics markets continue to improve. In addition, we are just beginning to realize initial growth from our stall expansion in China.
Shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel products to the global electrical energy market increased 4%. Shipments of our flat-roll nickel alloys and specialty stainless alloys increased 34% due to increased activity with some restocking in the oil and gas, electrical energy and aerospace distribution markets.
First quarter shipments of our flat-roll titanium products, including Unity, improved to 3.1 million pounds. First quarter shipments of our standard stainless sheet and plate products are up 22%, compared to the fourth quarter 2009 and up 54%, compared to the first quarter 2009 are about 78,000 tons. 78,000 tons annualized puts us within the 300,000 to 350,000 tons we need to effectively pace our operations. We saw steady improvements in efficiency from volume each month in the first quarter.
Giving us more confidence in this market, industry data reflects service center inventories remained at two and half months, which is still the historical low.
Meanwhile, average base prices are still very low while surcharges are rising. The benchmark 304 stainless surcharge will be $1.10 in May and is expected to rise to approximately $1.25 in June, based on current monthly average raw material prices.
Engineered product segment was profitable in the first quarter as we continue to see improving conditions for many of our products, particularly in the oil and gas market due to increasing demand for our tungsten drilling products.
Today, I would like to focus on two of our key markets. First, aerospace and defense and second, oil and gas. We believe these markets are not only showing signs of recovery but we were seeing early signs of secular growth.
In the aerospace market, sentiment changed dramatically in late February and March - and into March. Boeing and Airbus both announced they are not cutting current aircraft production schedules but instead they plan to increase production in 2010 and ‘11. Refer to our last conference call a quarter ago. Airbus plans to increase production in their single L320 series later this year. Boeing plans to increase production in their 777 and newly upgraded 747-8 aircraft during the next two years.
In addition, Boeing continues to report that flight tests of their new 787 Dreamliner and upgraded 787 are going well. First deliveries are expected by the end of 2010. Last week, Boeing said they plan to make an announcement during the second quarter, regarding a possible increase to their 737 single aisle production rates and by the end of this year, both commercial air frame makers plan to decide on first a new single aisle or an updated reengine of their existing single aisle aircraft.
We like the way ATI is positioned to benefit from these aircraft production rate increases of both legacy and the new airplanes. We also are very well position to benefit from the next generation air frame and jet engine programs. First, both engines and air frames are big parts of our business.
We have had strategic relationships with most of the key players. We have continued to improve the strategic position with new and expanded long-term contracts and with innovative new products. We have new and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities which, when coupled with our innovative new products, enable us to grow faster as well as larger in this growing aerospace and sense market sector.
We like the sector trends particularly, the trend to new lightweight aircraft powered by innovative new engines. We like the trend to near net shapes which helps our customers improve their buy to fly ratio, improve their parts making productivity and reduce their costs of making parts.
Near net shapes also provide ATI the opportunity to do more value added processing through both our flat roll products and long products businesses. For example, certain titanium long product near net shapes.
We start by melting the raw materials into an ingot, forging a billet, hot rolling a bar and then hot rolling a shape. We sell the ingots, we sell the billets, we sell the bars and we sell further value-added near net shapes.
In the rock products, mill products near net shapes begin with melting raw materials to an ingot for long product or slab for flat roll products. We like this trend. International aerospace market continues to grow. Going out further in the decade, the new Comac, Bombardier and Mitsubishi have announced plans to introduce new aircraft that use future generation jet engines that are under development such as GE's LEAP-X and Pratt-Whitney’s geared turbo fan.
Also, ATI will continue to benefit from the new designs in future air frames or from modifications and redesigns in existing air frames that use our specialty alloys as well as from the reengine of legacy aircraft. Our specialty metals are being put on the front of the wagon while others materials are rolling off the back. Lastly, the need to up armor and lightweight land based military vehicles opens new doors through design for our latest alloys and products to protect our service men and women.
Now, turning to the oil and gas market. The world continues to use and need more energy as developing and advanced nations, grow their per capita GDP and their citizens move to modern conveniences and life improvement. According to a respected industry source, to meet growing global demand, ""we need to find and get into production one new Saudi Arabia every three years.""
Oil and gas exploration has moved to extremely demanding locations such as deep water offshore and to unconventional sources such as shale gas and LNG deep in the earth. These environments require the strong and highly corrosive resistant alloys that we have invented and make today.
Here are some facts that indicate ATI's first quarter 2010 penetration and performance in this oil and gas market. Sales to this market increased by nearly 50% compared to a year ago and increased by approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter 2009.
Nearly 50% of our first quarter sales to the oil and gas market were direct international sales. It's a global market for us. We not only like the growth in rig count but we also like the factors in than ten growth in wells associated with shale gas and high pressure, high temperature exploration and production.
Offshore projects continue to be engineered around the globe and ATI is well positioned to benefit. We are improving our position with our existing key customers, adding new customers, becoming more global and seeing good growth in our innovative products such as our family of super duplex and lean duplex stainless alloys for umbilical sub C applications and top side applications.
In our data two, non-magnetic specialty alloy for drill strings and horizontal drilling, particularly in shale gas. We expect our shipments to the oil and gas market to continue to improve and to grow throughout 2010.
Finally, a quick update on our remaining strategic capital projects. We are pleased with the start up of our Raleigh, Utah, premium titanium sponge facility. We are operating more reduction furnaces and developing standard processes. This is a very big project, so we plan to ramp up the production throughout 2010 in a systematic manner.
The melt shop consolidation of our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty melt shop is progressing on schedule. We reduced the footprint and we expect considerable cost savings and its production efficiencies from this project when it is fully operational later this year.
We expect the benefit by up to $30 million in annualized cost reductions associated with this project, again, beginning in the second half of 2010. We are now in the critical final vendor selection process for a Brackenridge, Pennsylvania advanced hot rolling and processing facility.
All permits are in hand. The site preparation work is nearly completed. Overall, we expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $375 million. Before we open the call to questions, a final comment. First of all, our first quarter performance, operating performance as well as execution as well as improving order entry for most of our products reinforces our view that 2010 will be a year of steady quarter-on-quarter improvement.
We continue to believe 2010 is the transition year from 2009's global contraction to the resumption of secular growth trends, previously achieved in our key global markets. We expect to recover and then grow faster than our core global markets because we have an improved market position as demonstrated by our improving volume and forward load, new customers and expanded LTAs, innovative new product offerings, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities and finally, a globally focused and - focused reach that combined with the solid reputation of ATI and a solid international customer base in our key growth markets allows us to grow rapidly.
I think with those comments, operator, we will now open the call for any questions.

One is that the flat has to be up where we consider it operating at the standard practices. Meaning repeatable practices that have been fine tuned to what we would consider then practice that we would certify. And so this first part of the year, we are working on optimizing those practices for an optimized product.
So the certification process doesn't begin until we have standard processes in place. A standard process that would be used across all of our 36 ships sets, but production sets. So the first step in this is to get the process standardized, standardized work, if you will. Then the second part of that is determined by producing a lot of material in different sizes, mostly small sizes that we will use in different kinds of applications that we will certify those applications before it goes into anything in a jet engine. And so that process usually takes another year. So we are really talking about getting this plant to full certification in the next 18 months.

I think when you look at what our surcharge mechanisms are, as I mentioned in my comments, in our high performance metals business, we do not raise our indices at the ATI all back operations until at the end the quarter or the beginning of the next quarter.
So while we were producing in the first quarter whatever the indexes were on January 1, that's what the indexes would have been on March 31. So first of all, those indexes, as was publicly announced, are all up. So you can see the prices going up now. Secondly, those same indices for materials are used in our contractual methods, so all prices are up. So I would say the first quarter is the bottom and we are going to see prices increasing.

We talked back then about a disconnect between the supplier base and the OEMs on air frames and what they said they were going to make and what they were really going to do. And when we got - as you know better than I do, when we got into December and firmed up these rates, I think there were people out there that may have been cut - caught short someplace along the line or thought they could ramp up faster than they could.
So I think the bad news and the good news, the bad news is that they didn't order the parts when they could have got them in a smoothing type of schedule. The good news is that the business is picking up and people are trying to do some restocking as well as keeping up with the build rates. The very good news is the build rates are going to go up. The best news is that the 787 is going to get built and they are going to bring a lot of white tails up to sell at the end of this period of time. So I think in the interim, Boeing has the time while this plane is being certified to make sure that their supply chain in total is in good shape to meet the rates that they've said they are going to meet. And I have - my personal bet is that they are going to meet these rates.

But when we look at the best estimates of many of the people that make estimates on raw materials, we still see, for example in nickel, 300 million pounds on the LME. So we are pretty confident based on forecasts from third parties what we see that happened last year. Other kinds of things there will be some moderation from this rapid rise.
In contrast to that, while this rapid rise in surcharges and volume has been taking place, there has been extremely little movement in base prices or on the conversion price. So the history has been as these things level out and plateau or moderate or come down, then it's an opportunity to try to recover the prices that should be in effect for the amount of volume and market conditions on the convergent side. So my guess is that we will see base prices move up in some moderation on the surcharge mechanisms.

We've modernized all of our cold rolling mills to state of the art flatness gauge tension controls. We have improved our melt shop situation with the commodity melt shop and a specialty melt shop of both electrical steel and our nickel based alloys and ingot casting where we will, before the end of this year in the second half, close a complete footprint down.
So it isn't really the same company. We have been able to demonstrate over the last year, when business was really, really bad very low, our utilization rates that we were still able to make some money even under the worst of market conditions. So it's a different equation as we go forward. And I think that if we had the typical rates for this typical conversion revenues for this kind of a business, coupled with normal surcharge mechanisms, we will do just fine in that business.

So but I think going forward we would agree that, we might turn out to be wrong but we would agree that the amount of speculation that was going on in 2007 that drove raw material costs high to those levels is unlikely to repeat itself.
But what we do believe is that in addition to all the cost reductions that, Pat, has alluded to and the capabilities we have from a manufacturing and a capacity standpoint of the amount of business and focus that we have globally. The diversification of the company, the capacities and the value add focus that we have, we do believe that those kind of earnings that we achieved in the last cycle are achievable in the next cycle in just a different way. They won't be driven by some other raw material cost of volatility. So it will be driven by higher value added products, so different cost structure increased volume.
One of the things that we've said that we didn't have in place in 2007 that we will have in place as these markets grow going forward is the capability of producing $60 million pounds of titanium mill products in the kind of product mix focus that we want that we didn't have that capability before. And with the 787 ramp up and the industrial markets and the use of titanium and oil and gas, those opportunities we believe will be there. And in addition, we think in that time period, we will begin to see some of the demand growth from some markets that really weren't present in 2007 like nuclear.

And then the timing of the spend as we begin ramping up the hot rolling and processing facility investment will begin in more earnest ways here in the second half. And that matches up with the completion of some of the big projects Rowley and the melt shop consolidation, et cetera that we have been talking about.
So as we look at the $375 million more than half of that is expected to be focused in 2010 on the hot mill and processing facility. And as you know, that's a roughly a four year project. So as we look going forward, we would expect the kind of capital expenditure level of $350 to $400 million to continue for the next several years until the hot mill project is complete.
And we can - we have the capability because of how we are structuring that project to speed it up or slow it down a little bit depending upon what business circumstances are. But it's certainly our strong desire to complete that project and have it up and running before the end of 2013.

The other thing is, as you know, we look at cash deployment in a balanced way. So certainly, we focus on what our obligations are to take care of them and we fund managed working capital to grow earnings, which we did here in the first quarter and capital investments and the dividend policy. And if we have something left over I think we have demonstrated in the past that we look for the best ways to create shareholder value with that excess cash and free cash flow.
So fundamentally, we don't have a different viewpoint today than we've always had. We do like the fact that we have an untapped credit facility of $400 million. And we like that sitting there as well as a reasonable amount of cash on the balance sheet at any point in time. So that we maintain financial flexibility to do things that are in the best interest of our shareholders and that's the philosophy we operate to.

So that combined with mix becomes pretty big drivers of the LIFO assumption. I think that as you know how we do LIFO, we are projecting what we believe our year end costs will be. Year end being based upon our inventory turns essentially the last quarter of the year across the businesses by individual pool to come up with a current year index and that applied to the LIFO calculation and the projection of year end FIFO inventory determines what the full year LIFO reduction or increase on the reserve will be and then we take that ratably on a quarterly basis. So we will update that on every quarter. Our view here at the end of the first quarter is that, as we've said, that raw material costs will moderate.
To the extent that they don't, obviously, that will be impacted in our revised assumption as we go on a quarterly basis. Having said that, to the extent that they don't, I think that you will see FIFO profits increase as well. So how that plays against the LIFO reserve change will remain to be seen. But I don't think at this point in time it will be a significant driver one way or another but we will see. It all depends on what raw material costs do.

The question on the share count and the impact on the convertible. First of all, we’re governed obviously by the accounting rules in terms of how to deal with the diluted calculation on a convertible. And it's very fact specific depending on the company. So the drivers of that for us are the earnings, obviously, the tax rate and the interest expense on the convertible that’s flowing through the income statement on a quarterly basis. And in our case, that's also impacted by the fact that we capitalize a portion of our total interest expense under the accounting rules because of the construction of progress on our long-term capital projects. So the bottom line is when you put all of those factors in as it pertains to ATI, on a quarterly basis, using the $98 million share count which excludes the convertible effect, basically, our earnings per share have to be at or about $0.25 a share in the quarter before the convertible issuance is considered dilutive.
So because we were below $0.25, if we were above that, then we would have had to assume that the convertible shares were in fact converted which would increase our diluted shares up to about $108 million. But then we - $108 million shares. But then we would also have to add back to the reported GAAP net income a portion of the interest expense that is associated with that converted, because the convert assumes it's equity, not debt. But we have to adjust that for the amount of - pro rated amount of interest that we've capitalized. So that's a long answer. But the real impact, the real threshold is if you are at or below $0.25 a share using the $98 million shares, it will be anti-dilutive and therefore, not included.

Schedules are filling virtually across all of our product lines on flat rolled. I do believe there are some restocking going on as people are surprised maybe by some of the things that are - that they have seen. If they run out, they want to not only meet their current pull for their materials, but there is some restocking into the system. That especially happens if there is any schedule increases. Now, we have been able to bring back capacity in this business rather soon. We have been able to move up our melt shop schedules, move our hot rolling schedules up a bit, run some overtime quickly in the finishing end. And so there is still capacity to go.
But we were looking to - we are looking in our basic products to get up to that - in the stainless steel sheet and plate to get up around 350,000 tons. And then with the specialty products making up the other 40% more of that business, we would expect that if this trends all hold together and this recovery stays on track that it's on now, that we will see quarter-on-quarter improvement, quarter-on-quarter more tonnage until we are back to full utilizations or utilizations that we consider at practical capacity. So this is a pretty good recovery on the flat roll side that we seen over the last 90 days.

And there is some availability issues today with one supplier having to solve some quality problems and just the availability of material assets as a cycle picks back up. So I think in our particular case, we are glad to have the availability to us or the opportunity to move more sponge production in if we choose to versus the scrap market.
Other thing I think to consider is that as the programs of Boeing have some near net size kind of production coming out of Russia today, that that scrap that used to be in the U.S. is now held in Russia not coming to the U.S., at least that portion of it. So it's an interesting game that is changing from dealer to dealer, from week to week.

Apples-",2458,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward. Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples-to-apples, earnings were up from last quarter's $0.10 per share, excluding $0.26 of positive LIFO, to $0.24 per share without the healthcare legislation charge, or 140%. 
Shipments of most of our products increased, the one exception being exotic alloys, in many cases, by double digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. More importantly, overall order receipts were up significantly, causing lead times to extend by an additional two to eight weeks for High Performance Metals. Again, exotic alloys being the exception. Asset utilization rates increased throughout the first quarter, with the highest utilization being in March. These are all signs that we are recovering from the global contraction that impacted our business in 2009. 
In our business, recovery begins with volume, which improves capacity utilization. We are seeing continued positive signs, recovery and improving volume; second quarter production schedules are basically booked full at our current utilization rates; lead times are extending; and scrap is in short supply. Based on these continued market conditions, we believe there may be opportunities for improving base prices in the second half of 2010, as the business cycle continues to recover. 
Raw material surcharges for the second quarter shipments will be higher due to rising material costs. However, in our Flat-Rolled Products segment, base prices for many products, particularly stainless sheet and plate, remain low because of these rapidly rising material surcharges. The customers' total transaction price is up, but the base or conversion price is still very low. 
We believe we could see some moderation of raw material prices, coupled with increasing base prices, in the second half of 2010. These are all signs that a true business cycle recovery is underway. With steady quarter-on-quarter improvement, we continue to see 2010 as a transition year to resumption of secular growth in our key markets.
One more point, our direct international sales increased to approximately 34% of sales in the first quarter 2010. Today, ATI is more globally focused than ever before. A particularly important note, our Flat-Rolled Products segment achieved a record 35% of direct international sales in the first quarter of 2010. Our International business is recovering. An example, first quarter 2010 order entry from Asia is more than 3x the order level of the first quarter of 2009. Overall, our order book increased throughout the first quarter and continues to grow in the second quarter. 
Of note and comment is ATI's total first quarter titanium mill product shipments. This includes our High Performance Metals, plus Flat-Rolled Products, plus Uniti joint venture conversion. Total titanium mill product shipments for the first three months 2010 were 9.2 million pounds. We now believe we will ship over 40 million pounds of titanium products in 2010, so stay tuned for more as we go forward in this market.
Moving to our segments, all figures are comparisons of the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter 2009, since this is the most current indication of cyclical recovery. In our High Performance Metals segment, shipments of our titanium-based alloys increased 17%. Shipments of our nickel-based alloys, superalloys and specialty alloys increased 7%. This increase follows a 21% improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2009. 
Jet engine supply chain has begun to recover, as demand continues to build. After reducing inventories in 2009, the supply chain is becoming more in line with current aircraft build rates and increasing aftermarket demand. In addition, the jet engine supply chain appears to be more confident that the aircraft build rates are secure and may increase going forward. 
Inquiry rates and orders for our premium titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty alloys point to sustained improvement. Prices for many of our products are now beginning to increase as lead times are extending, and this should benefit, again, the second half shipments of 2010. 
We're also seeing increased activity from the oil and gas and medical markets. Shipments of our exotic alloys in the first quarter decreased substantially due to delayed, but not canceled, projects in the defense and chemical processing industries during 2009. We entered 2009 with a strong backlog for our exotic alloys. 
After the global financial issues hit, the backlog was worked down over the last year. This is a business that historically lags the economy by about six months, both up and down. Order increase for exotic alloys are just now beginning to increase, so we do expect shipments to gradually improve in the second half of 2010.
Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was approximately 22% of sales, excluding the idle facilities and new sponge facilities start-up costs of nearly $10 million in the first quarter. This is not where we want to be. 
So where are we? First, our titanium and nickel-based alloys business did quite well, in market share and volume improvements. On the other hand, our exotic alloys business did not perform anywhere near our 2009 levels because of delayed projects and programs. Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was negatively impacted by $9.9 million of startup in idle facility costs, mostly associated with our Raleigh, Utah plant and the Albany, Oregon titanium sponge facilities. 
Lastly, in the High Performance Metals segment, in our pricing mechanisms, we adjust raw material surcharges at the end of each quarter, not during the quarter. So we expect to benefit from higher raw material indices in the second quarter.
Now moving to our Flat-Rolled Products segment. First quarter shipment of our high-value flat-rolled products increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Here's some highlights: Shipments of our Engineered and Precision Rolled Strip products improved 15%. Demand is recovering from the global automotive market. 
In the construction market, orders reached near-historic highs for high-efficiency gas furnaces, there's some stimulus money. Demand from the aerospace and electronics markets continue to improve. In addition, we are just beginning to realize initial growth from our STAL expansion in China. 
Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel products to the global electrical energy market increased 4%. Shipments of our flat-rolled nickel alloys and specialty stainless alloys increased 34% due to increased activity, with some restocking in the oil and gas, electrical energy and aerospace distribution markets. 
This quarter's shipments of our flat-rolled titanium products, including Uniti, improved to 3.1 million pounds. First quarter shipments of our standard stainless sheet and plate products are up 22% compared to the fourth quarter 2009, and up 54% compared to the first quarter 2009, at or about 78,000 tons. 78,000 tons, annualized, puts us within the 300,000 to 350,000 tons we need to effectively pace our operations. 
We saw steady improvements in efficiency from volume each month in the first quarter, giving us more confidence in this market. Industry data reflects service center inventories remained at 2.5 months, which is still the historical low. Meanwhile, average base prices are still very low, while surcharges are rising. The benchmark 304 stainless surcharge will be $1.10 in May, and is expected to rise to approximately $1.25 in June based on current monthly average raw material prices. 
Engineered Products segment was profitable in the first quarter, as we continue to see improving conditions for many of our products, particularly in the oil and gas market, due to increasing demand for our tungsten drilling products. 
Today, I would like to focus on two of our key markets. First, aerospace and defense; and second, oil and gas. We believe these markets are not only showing signs of recovery, but we're seeing early signs of secular growth. In the aerospace market, sentiment changed dramatically in late February and into March. Boeing and Airbus both announced that they are not cutting current aircraft production schedules, but instead they plan to increase production in 2010 and '11. Refer to our last conference a quarter ago. 
Airbus plans to increase production in their single-aisle 320 series later this year. Boeing plans to increase production of their 777 and newly upgraded 747-8 aircraft during the next two years. In addition, Boeing continues to report that flight test of their new 787 Dreamliner and upgraded 787 are going well. First deliveries are expected by the end of 2010. 
Last week, Boeing said they plan to make an announcement during the second quarter regarding a possible increase to their 737 single-aisle production rates. And by the end of this year, both commercial airframe makers plan to decide on, first, a new single aisle, or an updated reengine of their existing single-aisle aircraft. 
We liked the way ATI is positioned to benefit from these aircraft production rate increases, of both legacy and the new airplanes. We also are very well-positioned to benefit from the next generation airframe and jet engine programs. First, both engines and airframes are big parts of our business. We have had strategic relationships with most of the key players. We have continued to improve the strategic position with new and expanded long-term contracts and with innovative new products. We have new and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities, which, when coupled with our innovative new products, enable us to grow faster, as well as larger, in this growing aerospace and defense market sector. 
We like the sector trends, particularly the trend to new lightweight aircraft powered by innovative new engines. We like the trend to near net shapes, which helps our customers improve their buy-to-fly ratio, improve their parts-making productivity and reduce their cost of making parts. Near net shapes also provide ATI the opportunity to do more value-added processing through both our Flat-Rolled Products and Long Products business. 
For example, certain titanium long product near net shapes. We start by melting the raw materials into an ingot, forging a billet, hot rolling a bar and then hot rolling a shape. We sell the ingots, we sell the billets, we sell the bars and we sell further value-added near net shapes. In the rock products, mill products, near net shapes begin with melting raw materials to an ingot for long products, or slab for flat-rolled products. We like this trend. 
International aerospace market continues to grow. Going out further in the decade, the new Comac, Bombardier and Mitsubishi have announced plans to introduce new aircraft that use future-generation jet engines that are under development, such as GE's LEAP-X and Pratt & Whitney's geared turbo fan. 
Also ATI will continue to benefit from the new designs in future airframes, or from modifications and redesigns in existing airframes that use our specialty alloys, as well as from the reengine of legacy aircraft. Our specialty metals are being put on the front of the wagon, while other's materials are rolling off the back. Lastly, the need to up-armor and lightweight land-based military vehicles opens new doors through design for our latest alloys and products to protect our service men and women. 
Now turning to the Oil and Gas markets. The world continues to use and need more energy, as developing an advance nations grow their per capita GDP and their citizens move to modern conveniences and life improvement. According to a respected industry source, to meet growing global demand, ""We need to find and get into production one new Saudi Arabia every three years"".  
Oil and gas exploration has moved to extremely demanding locations, such as deepwater offshore and to unconventional sources, such as shale gas and LNG deep in the earth. These environments require the strong and highly corrosive resistant alloys that we have invented and make today. 
Here are some facts that indicate ATI's first quarter 2010 penetration and performance in this oil and gas market: Sales to this market increased by nearly 50% compared to a year ago, and increase by approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter 2009. Nearly 50% of our first quarter sales to the oil and gas market were direct international sales, it's a global market for us. We not only like the growth in rig count, we also like the faster-than-ten growth in wells associated with shale gas and high-pressure, high-temperature exploration and production. 
Offshore projects continue to be engineered around the globe. And ATI is well-positioned to benefit. We're improving our position with our existing key customers, adding new customers, becoming more global and seeing good growth in our innovative products, such as our family of super duplex and lean duplex stainless alloys, for umbilical subsea applications and top-side applications. In our data, too, non-magnetic specialty alloy for drill strings and horizontal drilling, particularly in shale gas. We expect our shipments to the oil and gas market to continue to improve and to grow throughout 2010.
Finally, a quick update on our remaining strategic capital projects. We're pleased with the startup of our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility. We're operating more reduction furnaces and developing standard processes. This is a very big project, so we plan to ramp up the production throughout 2010 in a systematic manner. 
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty melt shop is progressing on schedule. We reduced the footprint, and we expect considerable cost savings and its production efficiencies from this project when it is fully operational later this year. We expect to benefit by up $30 million of annualized cost reductions associated with this project, again, beginning in the second half of 2010. 
We are now in the critical final vendor selection process for our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania advanced hot-rolling and processing facility. All permits are in hand. The site preparation work is nearly completed. Overall, we expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $375 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, a final comment. First of all, our first quarter performance, operating performance, as well as execution, as well as improving order entry for most of our products, reinforces our view that 2010 will be a year of steady, quarter-on-quarter improvement. We continue to believe 2010 is the transition year, from 2009's global contraction to the resumption of secular growth trends previously achieved in our key global markets. 
We expect to recover and then grow faster than our core global markets because we have an improved market position as demonstrated by our improving volume and forward load, new customers and expanded LTAs, innovative new product offerings, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities and, finally, a globally focus and focused reach that, combined with the solid reputation of ATI and a solid international customer base in our key growth markets, allows us to grow rapidly. 
I think with those comments, operator, we'll now open up the call for any questions."

One is that the flat has to be up where we consider it operating at the standard practices, meaning, repeatable practices that haven't fine-tuned to what we would consider then a practice that we would certify. And so this first part of the year, we're working on optimizing those practices for unoptimized products. So the certification process doesn't begin until we have standard processes in place, a standard process that would be used across all of our 36 -- not chipsets, but production sets. So the first step in this is to get the process standardized, standardized work, if you will. Then the second part of that is determined by producing a lot of material in different sizes, mostly small sizes that we will use in different kinds of applications, that we will certify those applications before it goes into anything in a jet engine. And so that process usually takes another year. So we're really talking about getting this plant to full certification in the next 18 months."

So while we were producing in the first quarter, whatever the indexings were on January 1, that's what the indexes would have been on March 31. So first of all, those indexes, as was publicly announced, are all up. So you can see the prices going up now. Secondly, those same industries for materials are used in our contractual methods, so all prices are up. So I would say, the first quarter is the bottom, and we're going to see prices increasing."

We talked back then about a disconnect between the supplier base and the OEMs on airframes, what they said they're going to make and what they were really going to do. And when we got -- as you know better than I do, when we got into December and firmed up these rates, I think there were people out there that may have been cut short someplace along the line or thought they could ramp up faster than they could. So I think, the bad news and the good news, the bad news is that they didn't order the parts where they could have got them in a smoothing type of schedule. The good news is that the business is picking up, and people are trying to do some restocking as well as keeping up with the build rates. The very good news is the build rates are going to go up. The best news is that the 787 is going to get built, and they are going to bring a lot of white tails up to sell at the end of period of time. So I think in the interim, Boeing has the time while this plan is being certified to make sure that their supply chain, in total, is in good shape to meet the rates that they said they're going to meet. And I have -- my personal bet is that they're going to meet these rates."

But when we look at the best estimates of many of the people that make estimates on raw materials, we still see, for example in nickel, 300 million pounds on the LME [London Metal Exchange]. So we're pretty confident, based on forecast from third parties, what we see that happened last year, other kinds of things, that will be some moderation from this rapid rise. In contrast to that, while this rapid rise in surcharges and volume has been taking place, there's been extremely little movement in base prices or on the conversion price. So the history has been, as these things level out and plateau or moderate or come down, then it's an opportunity to try to recover the prices that should be in effect for the amount of volume and market conditions on the conversion side. So my guess is that we'll see base prices move up and some moderation on the surcharge mechanisms."

We basically have a dedicated sheet plant. We've modernized all of our cold rolling mills to state-of-the-art flatness gauge tension controls. We have improved our melt shop situation with the commodity melt shop and a specialty melt shop of both electrical steel and our nickel-based alloys and ingot casting, where we will, before the end of this year, in the second half, close a complete footprint down. So it isn't really the same company. We've been able to demonstrate over the last year, when business was really, really bad, very low utilization rates that we were still able to make some money even under the worst of market conditions. So it's a different equation as we go forward. And I think that if we had the typical rates for this typical conversion revenues for this kind of a business, coupled with normal surcharge mechanisms, we'll do just fine in that business.

A large piece of that from an earning standpoint was obviously offset by significant LIFO-inventory reserve charges, since most of our inventory's on LIFO. But I think going forward, we would agree that we might turn out to be wrong. But we would agree that the amount of speculation that was going on in 2007 that drove raw material costs high, that those levels is unlikely to repeat itself. But what we do believe is that, in addition, all the cost reductions that Pat has alluded to and the capabilities we have from a manufacturing and a capacity standpoint, the amount of business and focus that we have globally, the diversification of the company, the capacities and the value-add focus that we have, we do believe that those kind of earnings that we achieved in the last cycle are achievable in the next cycle in just a different way. They won't be driven by some of the raw material cost volatility. We'll be driven by higher value-added products, a different cost structure, increased volume. One of the things that we've said that we didn't have in place since 2007 that we will have in place as these markets grow going forward is the capability of producing 60 million pounds of titanium mill products in the kind of a product-mix focus that we want that we didn't have that capability before. And with the 787 ramp up in the industrial markets and the use of titanium in oil and gas, those opportunities, we believe, will be there. And in addition, we think in that time period, we'll begin to see some of the demand growth from some markets that really weren't present in 2007 like nuclear."

So I would say, our earlier comments that we believe that market is about flat for us is what we would say, although, we had about a 4% increase in the first quarter."

You also have to look at titanium and titanium sponge, and you know what the public comments are about the contractual enterprises year-over-year. So that, combined with mix, becomes pretty, pretty big drivers of a LIFO assumption. I think that as -- you know how we do LIFO. I mean, we are projecting what we believe our year-end cost will be, year end being based upon our inventory turns, essentially the last quarter of the year across the businesses by individual pool, to come up with a current-year index, and that apply to the LIFO calculation. And the projection of year-end LIFO inventory determines what the full year LIFO reduction or increase on the reserve will be, and then we take that ratably on a quarterly basis. So we'll update that every quarter. Our view here at the end of the first quarter is that, as we've said, that raw material cost will moderate. To the extent that they don't, obviously, that would be impacted in our revised assumption as we go on, on a quarterly basis. Having said that, to the extent that they don't, I think that you'll see FIFO [first-in, first-out] profits increase as well. So how that plays against the LIFO-reserve change would remain to be seen. But I don't think, at this point in time, it would be a significant driver in one way or another, but we'll see. It all depends on what raw material costs do."

First of all, we're governed obviously by the accounting rules in terms of how to deal with the diluted calculation on the convertible, and it's very fact specific depending upon the company. So the drivers of that for us are the earnings, obviously; the tax rate; and the interest expense on the convertible, that's flowing through the income statement on a quarterly basis. And in our case, that's also impacted by the fact that we capitalized a portion of our total interest expense under the accounting rules because of the construction and progress on our long-term capital projects. So the bottom line is, when you put all of those factors in as it pertains to ATI, on a quarterly basis, using the 98 million share count, which excludes the convertible effect, basically, our earnings per share has to be at or about $0.25 a share in the quarter before the convertible issuance is considered dilutive. So because we're below $0.25, if we were above that, then we would have had to assume that the convertible shares were in fact converted, which would increase our diluted shares up to about 108 million shares. But then we would also have to add back to the reported GAAP net income a portion of the interest expense that's associated with that converted, because the convert assumes that equity, not debt. But we would have to adjust that for the amount of prorated amount of interest that we've capitalized. So that's a long answer. But the real impact, the real threshold, is if you're add or below $0.25 a share using the 98 million shares, it would be anti-dilutive and therefore not included."

348893,100778649,61152,"Allegheny Technologies Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ATI Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward. Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples-",2462,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward. Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples-to-apples, earnings were up from last quarter's $0.10 per share, excluding $0.26 of positive LIFO, to $0.24 per share without the healthcare legislation charge, or 140%. 
Shipments of most of our products increased, the one exception being exotic alloys, in many cases, by double digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. More importantly, overall order receipts were up significantly, causing lead times to extend by an additional two to eight weeks for High Performance Metals. Again, exotic alloys being the exception. Asset utilization rates increased throughout the first quarter, with the highest utilization being in March. These are all signs that we are recovering from the global contraction that impacted our business in 2009. 
In our business, recovery begins with volume, which improves capacity utilization. We are seeing continued positive signs, recovery and improving volume; second quarter production schedules are basically booked full at our current utilization rates; lead times are extending; and scrap is in short supply. Based on these continued market conditions, we believe there may be opportunities for improving base prices in the second half of 2010, as the business cycle continues to recover. 
Raw material surcharges for the second quarter shipments will be higher due to rising material costs. However, in our Flat-Rolled Products segment, base prices for many products, particularly stainless sheet and plate, remain low because of these rapidly rising material surcharges. The customers' total transaction price is up, but the base or conversion price is still very low. 
We believe we could see some moderation of raw material prices, coupled with increasing base prices, in the second half of 2010. These are all signs that a true business cycle recovery is underway. With steady quarter-on-quarter improvement, we continue to see 2010 as a transition year to resumption of secular growth in our key markets.
One more point, our direct international sales increased to approximately 34% of sales in the first quarter 2010. Today, ATI is more globally focused than ever before. A particularly important note, our Flat-Rolled Products segment achieved a record 35% of direct international sales in the first quarter of 2010. Our International business is recovering. An example, first quarter 2010 order entry from Asia is more than 3x the order level of the first quarter of 2009. Overall, our order book increased throughout the first quarter and continues to grow in the second quarter. 
Of note and comment is ATI's total first quarter titanium mill product shipments. This includes our High Performance Metals, plus Flat-Rolled Products, plus Uniti joint venture conversion. Total titanium mill product shipments for the first three months 2010 were 9.2 million pounds. We now believe we will ship over 40 million pounds of titanium products in 2010, so stay tuned for more as we go forward in this market.
Moving to our segments, all figures are comparisons of the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter 2009, since this is the most current indication of cyclical recovery. In our High Performance Metals segment, shipments of our titanium-based alloys increased 17%. Shipments of our nickel-based alloys, superalloys and specialty alloys increased 7%. This increase follows a 21% improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2009. 
Jet engine supply chain has begun to recover, as demand continues to build. After reducing inventories in 2009, the supply chain is becoming more in line with current aircraft build rates and increasing aftermarket demand. In addition, the jet engine supply chain appears to be more confident that the aircraft build rates are secure and may increase going forward. 
Inquiry rates and orders for our premium titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty alloys point to sustained improvement. Prices for many of our products are now beginning to increase as lead times are extending, and this should benefit, again, the second half shipments of 2010. 
We're also seeing increased activity from the oil and gas and medical markets. Shipments of our exotic alloys in the first quarter decreased substantially due to delayed, but not canceled, projects in the defense and chemical processing industries during 2009. We entered 2009 with a strong backlog for our exotic alloys. 
After the global financial issues hit, the backlog was worked down over the last year. This is a business that historically lags the economy by about six months, both up and down. Order increase for exotic alloys are just now beginning to increase, so we do expect shipments to gradually improve in the second half of 2010.
Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was approximately 22% of sales, excluding the idle facilities and new sponge facilities start-up costs of nearly $10 million in the first quarter. This is not where we want to be. 
So where are we? First, our titanium and nickel-based alloys business did quite well, in market share and volume improvements. On the other hand, our exotic alloys business did not perform anywhere near our 2009 levels because of delayed projects and programs. Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was negatively impacted by $9.9 million of startup in idle facility costs, mostly associated with our Raleigh, Utah plant and the Albany, Oregon titanium sponge facilities. 
Lastly, in the High Performance Metals segment, in our pricing mechanisms, we adjust raw material surcharges at the end of each quarter, not during the quarter. So we expect to benefit from higher raw material indices in the second quarter.
Now moving to our Flat-Rolled Products segment. First quarter shipment of our high-value flat-rolled products increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Here's some highlights: Shipments of our Engineered and Precision Rolled Strip products improved 15%. Demand is recovering from the global automotive market. 
In the construction market, orders reached near-historic highs for high-efficiency gas furnaces, there's some stimulus money. Demand from the aerospace and electronics markets continue to improve. In addition, we are just beginning to realize initial growth from our STAL expansion in China. 
Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel products to the global electrical energy market increased 4%. Shipments of our flat-rolled nickel alloys and specialty stainless alloys increased 34% due to increased activity, with some restocking in the oil and gas, electrical energy and aerospace distribution markets. 
This quarter's shipments of our flat-rolled titanium products, including Uniti, improved to 3.1 million pounds. First quarter shipments of our standard stainless sheet and plate products are up 22% compared to the fourth quarter 2009, and up 54% compared to the first quarter 2009, at or about 78,000 tons. 78,000 tons, annualized, puts us within the 300,000 to 350,000 tons we need to effectively pace our operations. 
We saw steady improvements in efficiency from volume each month in the first quarter, giving us more confidence in this market. Industry data reflects service center inventories remained at 2.5 months, which is still the historical low. Meanwhile, average base prices are still very low, while surcharges are rising. The benchmark 304 stainless surcharge will be $1.10 in May, and is expected to rise to approximately $1.25 in June based on current monthly average raw material prices. 
Engineered Products segment was profitable in the first quarter, as we continue to see improving conditions for many of our products, particularly in the oil and gas market, due to increasing demand for our tungsten drilling products. 
Today, I would like to focus on two of our key markets. First, aerospace and defense; and second, oil and gas. We believe these markets are not only showing signs of recovery, but we're seeing early signs of secular growth. In the aerospace market, sentiment changed dramatically in late February and into March. Boeing and Airbus both announced that they are not cutting current aircraft production schedules, but instead they plan to increase production in 2010 and '11. Refer to our last conference a quarter ago. 
Airbus plans to increase production in their single-aisle 320 series later this year. Boeing plans to increase production of their 777 and newly upgraded 747-8 aircraft during the next two years. In addition, Boeing continues to report that flight test of their new 787 Dreamliner and upgraded 787 are going well. First deliveries are expected by the end of 2010. 
Last week, Boeing said they plan to make an announcement during the second quarter regarding a possible increase to their 737 single-aisle production rates. And by the end of this year, both commercial airframe makers plan to decide on, first, a new single aisle, or an updated reengine of their existing single-aisle aircraft. 
We liked the way ATI is positioned to benefit from these aircraft production rate increases, of both legacy and the new airplanes. We also are very well-positioned to benefit from the next generation airframe and jet engine programs. First, both engines and airframes are big parts of our business. We have had strategic relationships with most of the key players. We have continued to improve the strategic position with new and expanded long-term contracts and with innovative new products. We have new and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities, which, when coupled with our innovative new products, enable us to grow faster, as well as larger, in this growing aerospace and defense market sector. 
We like the sector trends, particularly the trend to new lightweight aircraft powered by innovative new engines. We like the trend to near net shapes, which helps our customers improve their buy-to-fly ratio, improve their parts-making productivity and reduce their cost of making parts. Near net shapes also provide ATI the opportunity to do more value-added processing through both our Flat-Rolled Products and Long Products businesses. For example, certain titanium long product near net shapes. 
We start by melting the raw materials into an ingot, forging a billet, hot rolling a bar and then hot rolling a shape. We sell the ingots, we sell the billets, we sell the bars and we sell further value-added near net shapes. In the rock products, mill products, near net shapes begin with melting raw materials to an ingot for long products, or slab for flat-rolled products. We like this trend. 
International aerospace market continues to grow. Going out further in the decade, the new Comac, Bombardier and Mitsubishi have announced plans to introduce new aircraft that use future-generation jet engines that are under development, such as GE's LeapX and Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbo Fan. 
Also, ATI will continue to benefit from the new designs in future airframes, or from modifications and redesigns in existing airframes that use our specialty alloys, as well as from the reengine of legacy aircraft. Our specialty metals are being put on the front of the wagon, while other's materials are rolling off the back. Lastly, the need to up armor and lightweight land-based military vehicles opens new doors through design for our latest alloys and products to protect our service men and women. 
Now turning to the Oil and Gas markets. The world continues to use and need more energy, as developing and advanced nations grow their per capita GDP and their citizens move to modern conveniences and life improvement. According to a respected industry source, to meet growing global demand, ""We need to find and get into production one new Saudi Arabia every three years.""  
Oil and gas exploration has moved to extremely demanding locations, such as deepwater offshore and to unconventional sources, such as shale gas and LNG deep in the earth. These environments require the strong and highly corrosive resistant alloys that we have invented and make today. 
Here are some facts that indicate ATI's first quarter 2010 penetration and performance in this oil and gas market. Sales to this market increased by nearly 50% compared to a year ago, and increased by approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter 2009. Nearly 50% of our first quarter sales to the oil and gas market were direct international sales. It's a global market for us. We not only like the growth in rig count, we also like the faster-than-ten growth in wells associated with shale gas and high-pressure, high-temperature exploration and production. 
Offshore projects continue to be engineered around the globe. And ATI is well positioned to benefit. We're improving our position with our existing key customers, adding new customers, becoming more global and seeing good growth in our innovative products, such as our family of super duplex and lean duplex stainless alloys, for umbilical subsea applications and top-side applications, in our Data 2 [Datalloy 2] non-magnetic specialty alloy for drill strings and horizontal drilling, particularly in shale gas. We expect our shipments to the oil and gas market to continue to improve and to grow throughout 2010.
Finally, a quick update on our remaining strategic capital projects. We are pleased with the startup of our Rowley, Utah premium titanium sponge facility. We're operating more reduction furnaces and developing standard processes. This is a very big project, so we plan to ramp up the production throughout 2010 in a systematic manner. 
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty melt shop is progressing on schedule. We reduced the footprint, and we expect considerable cost savings and its production efficiencies from this project when it is fully operational later this year. We expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions associated with this project, again, beginning in the second half of 2010. 
We are now in the critical final vendor selection process for our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania advanced hot-rolling and processing facility. All permits are in hand. The site preparation work is nearly completed. Overall, we expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $375 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, a final comment. First of all, our first quarter performance, operating performance, as well as execution, as well as improving order entry for most of our products, reinforces our view that 2010 will be a year of steady, quarter-on-quarter improvement. We continue to believe 2010 is the transition year from 2009's global contraction to the resumption of secular growth trends previously achieved in our key global markets. 
We expect to recover and then grow faster than our core global markets because we have an improved market position as demonstrated by our improving volume and forward load, new customers and expanded LTAs, innovative new product offerings, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities, and finally, a globally focused reach that, combined with the solid reputation of ATI and a solid international customer base in our key growth markets, allows us to grow rapidly. 
I think with those comments, operator, we'll now open up the call for any questions."

And so this first part of the year, we're working on optimizing those practices for unoptimized products. So the certification process doesn't begin until we have standard processes in place, a standard process that would be used across all of our 36 -- not chipsets, but production sets. So the first step in this is to get the process standardized, standardized work, if you will. Then the second part of that is determined by producing a lot of material in different sizes, mostly small sizes that we will use in different kinds of applications, that we will certify those applications before it goes into anything in a jet engine. And so that process usually takes another year. So we're really talking about getting this plant to full certification in the next 18 months."

So first of all, those indexes, as was publicly announced, are all up. So you can see the prices going up now. Secondly, those same industries for materials are used in our contractual methods, so all prices are up. So I would say, the first quarter is the bottom, and we're going to see prices increasing."

And when we got -- as you know better than I do, when we got into December and firmed up these rates, I think there were people out there that may have been cut short someplace along the line or thought they could ramp up faster than they could. So I think, the bad news and the good news, the bad news is that they didn't order the parts where they could have got them in a smoothing type of schedule. The good news is that the business is picking up, and people are trying to do some restocking as well as keeping up with the build rates. The very good news is the build rates are going to go up. The best news is that the 787 is going to get built, and they are going to bring a lot of white tails up to sell at the end of period of time. So I think in the interim, Boeing has the time while this plan is being certified to make sure that their supply chain, in total, is in good shape to meet the rates that they said they're going to meet.

But when we look at the best estimates of many of the people that make estimates on raw materials, we still see, for example in nickel, 300 million pounds on the LME [London Metal Exchange]. So we're pretty confident, based on forecast from third parties, what we see that happened last year, other kinds of things, that will be some moderation from this rapid rise. In contrast to that, while this rapid rise in surcharges and volume has been taking place, there's been extremely little movement in base prices or on the conversion price. So the history has been, as these things level out and plateau or moderate or come down, then it's an opportunity to try to recover the prices that should be in effect for the amount of volume and market conditions on the conversion side. So my guess is that we'll see base prices move up and some moderation on the surcharge mechanisms."

We have improved our melt shop situation with the commodity melt shop and a specialty melt shop of both electrical steel and our nickel-based alloys and ingot casting, where we will, before the end of this year, in the second half, close a complete footprint down. So it isn't really the same company. We've been able to demonstrate over the last year, when business was really, really bad, very low utilization rates that we were still able to make some money even under the worst of market conditions. So it's a different equation as we go forward.

A large piece of that from an earnings standpoint was obviously offset by significant LIFO inventory reserve charges, since most of our inventory's on LIFO. But I think going forward, we would agree that we might turn out to be wrong. But we would agree that the amount of speculation that was going on in 2007 that drove raw material costs high, that those levels is unlikely to repeat itself. But what we do believe is that, in addition, all the cost reductions that Pat has alluded to and the capabilities we have from a manufacturing and a capacity standpoint, the amount of business and focus that we have globally, the diversification of the company, the capacities and the value-add focus that we have, we do believe that those kind of earnings that we achieved in the last cycle are achievable in the next cycle in just a different way. They won't be driven by some of the raw material cost volatility. It will be driven by higher value-added products, a different cost structure, increased volume. One of the things that we've said that we didn't have in place in 2007 that we will have in place as these markets grow going forward is the capability of producing 60 million pounds of titanium mill products in the kind of a product mix focus that we want that we didn't have that capability before. And with the 787 ramp up in the industrial markets and the use of titanium in oil and gas, those opportunities, we believe, will be there. And in addition, we think in that time period, we'll begin to see some of the demand growth from some markets that really weren't present in 2007 like nuclear."

You also have to look at titanium and titanium sponge, and you know what the public comments are about the contractual enterprises year-over-year. So that, combined with mix, becomes pretty, pretty big drivers of a LIFO assumption. I think that as -- you know how we do LIFO. I mean, we are projecting what we believe our year-end cost will be, year end being based upon our inventory turns, essentially the last quarter of the year across the businesses by individual pool, to come up with a current-year index, and that apply to the LIFO calculation. And the projection of year-end LIFO inventory determines what the full year LIFO reduction or increase on the reserve will be, and then we take that ratably on a quarterly basis. So we'll update that every quarter. Our view here at the end of the first quarter is that, as we've said, that raw material cost will moderate. To the extent that they don't, obviously, that would be impacted in our revised assumption as we go on, on a quarterly basis. Having said that, to the extent that they don't, I think that you'll see FIFO [first-in, first-out] profits increase as well. So how that plays against the LIFO-reserve change would remain to be seen. But I don't think, at this point in time, it would be a significant driver in one way or another, but we'll see. It all depends on what raw material costs do."

First of all, we're governed obviously by the accounting rules in terms of how to deal with the diluted calculation on the convertible, and it's very fact specific depending upon the company. So the drivers of that for us are the earnings, obviously; the tax rate; and the interest expense on the convertible, that's flowing through the income statement on a quarterly basis. And in our case, that's also impacted by the fact that we capitalized a portion of our total interest expense under the accounting rules because of the construction and progress on our long-term capital projects. So the bottom line is, when you put all of those factors in as it pertains to ATI, on a quarterly basis, using the 98 million share count, which excludes the convertible effect, basically, our earnings per share has to be at or about $0.25 a share in the quarter before the convertible issuance is considered dilutive. So because we're below $0.25, if we were above that, then we would have had to assume that the convertible shares were in fact converted, which would increase our diluted shares up to about 108 million shares. But then we would also have to add back to the reported GAAP net income a portion of the interest expense that's associated with that converted, because the convert assumes that equity, not debt. But we would have to adjust that for the amount of prorated amount of interest that we've capitalized. So that's a long answer. But the real impact, the real threshold, is if you're add or below $0.25 a share using the 98 million shares, it would be anti-dilutive and therefore not included."

Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward. Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples-",2463,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let's start by discussing our first quarter performance and some positive implications for our business going forward. Sales were up 10% over last quarter to approximately $900 million. Apples-to-apples, earnings were up from last quarter's $0.10 per share, excluding $0.26 of positive LIFO, to $0.24 per share without the healthcare legislation charge, or 140%. 
Shipments of most of our products increased, the one exception being, exotic alloys, in many cases, by double digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. More importantly, overall order receipts were up significantly causing lead times to extend by an additional two to eight weeks for High Performance Metals. Again, exotic alloys being the exception. Asset utilization rates increased throughout the first quarter, with the highest utilization being in March. These are all signs that we are recovering from the global contraction that impacted our business in 2009. 
In our business, recovery begins with volume, which improves capacity utilization. We are seeing continued positive signs, recovery and improving volume, second quarter production schedules are basically booked full at our current utilization, rates, lead times are extending and scrap is in short supply. Based on these continued market conditions, we believe there may be opportunities for improving base prices in the second half of 2010 as the business cycle continues to recover. 
Raw material surcharges for the second quarter shipments will be higher due to rising material costs. However, in our Flat-Rolled Products segment, base prices for many products, particularly stainless sheet and plate, remain low because of these rapidly rising material surcharges. The customers' total transaction price is up, but the base or conversion price is still very low. 
We believe we could see some moderation of raw material prices, coupled with increasing base prices, in the second half of 2010. These are all signs that a true business cycle recovery is underway. With steady quarter-on-quarter improvement, we continue to see 2010 as a transition year to resumption of secular growth in our key markets.
One more point, our direct international sales increased to approximately 34% of sales in the first quarter 2010. Today, ATI is more globally focused than ever before. A particularly important note, our Flat-Rolled Products segment achieved a record 35% of direct international sales in the first quarter of 2010. Our International business is recovering. An example, first quarter 2010 order entry from Asia is more than 3x the order level of the first quarter of 2009. Overall, our order book increased throughout the first quarter and continues to grow in the second quarter. 
Of note and comment is ATI's total first quarter titanium mill product shipments. This includes our High Performance Metals, plus Flat-Rolled Products, plus Uniti joint venture conversion. Total titanium mill product shipments for the first three months 2010 were 9.2 million pounds. We now believe we will ship over 40 million pounds of titanium products in 2010, so stay tuned for more as we go forward in this market.
Moving to our segments, all figures are comparisons of the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter 2009 since this is the most current indication of cyclical recovery. In our High Performance Metals segment, shipments of our titanium-based alloys increased 17%. Shipments of our nickel-based alloys, superalloys and specialty alloys increased 7%. This increase follows a 21% improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2009. 
Jet engine supply chain has begun to recover as demand continues to build. After reducing inventories in 2009, the supply chain is becoming more in line with current aircraft build rates and increasing aftermarket demand. In addition, the jet engine supply chain appears to be more confident that the aircraft build rates are secure and may increase going forward. 
Inquiry rates and orders for our premium titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty alloys point to sustained improvement. Prices for many of our products are now beginning to increase as lead times are extending and this should benefit, again, the second half shipments of 2010. 
We're also seeing increased activity from the oil and gas and medical markets. Shipments of our exotic alloys in the first quarter decreased substantially due to delayed, but not canceled, projects in the defense and chemical processing industries during 2009. We entered 2009 with the strong backlog for our exotic alloys. 
After the global financial issues hit, the backlog was worked down over the last year. This is a business that historically lags the economy by about six months, both up and down. Order increase for exotic alloys are just now beginning to increase, so we do expect shipments to gradually improve in the second half of 2010.
Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was approximately 22% of sales, excluding the idle facilities and new sponge facilities start-up costs of nearly $10 million in the first quarter. This is not where we want to be. 
So where are we? First, our Titanium and Nickel-based Alloys business did quite well in market share and volume improvements. On the other hand, our Exotic Alloys business did not perform anywhere near our 2009 levels because of delayed projects and programs. Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was negatively impacted by $9.9 million of startup in idle facility costs, mostly associated with our Raleigh, Utah plant and the Albany, Oregon titanium sponge facilities. 
Lastly, in the High Performance Metals segment, in our pricing mechanisms, we adjust raw material surcharges at the end of each quarter, not during the quarter. So we expect to benefit from higher raw material indices in the second quarter.
Now moving to our Flat-Rolled Products segment. First quarter shipments of our high-value flat-rolled products increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Here's some highlights: Shipments of our Engineered and Precision-Rolled Strip products improved 15%. Demand is recovering from the global automotive market. In the construction market, orders reached near-historic highs for high-efficiency gas furnaces, there's some stimulus money. Demand from the aerospace and electronics markets continue to improve. In addition, we are just beginning to realize initial growth from our STAL expansion in China. 
Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel products to the global electrical energy market increased 4%. Shipments of our flat-rolled nickel alloys and specialty stainless alloys increased 34% due to increased activity, with some restocking in the oil and gas, electrical energy and aerospace distribution markets. 
First quarter's shipments of our flat-rolled titanium products, including Uniti, improved to 3.1 million pounds. First quarter shipments of our standard stainless sheet and plate products are up 22% compared to the fourth quarter 2009 and up 54% compared to the first quarter 2009, at or about 78,000 tons. 78,000 tons, annualized, puts us within the 300,000 to 350,000 tons we need to effectively pace our operations. 
We saw steady improvements in efficiency from volume each month in the first quarter. Giving us more confidence in this market, industry data reflects service center inventories remained at 2.5 months, which is still the historical low. Meanwhile, average base prices are still very low, while surcharges are rising. The benchmark 304 stainless surcharge will be $1.10 in May and is expected to rise to approximately $1.25 in June based on current monthly average raw material prices. 
Engineered Products segment was profitable in the first quarter, as we continue to see improving conditions for many of our products, particularly in the oil and gas market due to increasing demand for our tungsten drilling products. 
Today, I would like to focus on two of our key markets. First, aerospace and defense and second, oil and gas. We believe these markets are not only showing signs of recovery, but we're seeing early signs of secular growth. In the aerospace market, sentiment changed dramatically in late February and into March. Boeing and Airbus both announced that they are not cutting current aircraft production schedules, but instead they plan to increase production in 2010 and '11. Refer to our last conference call a quarter ago. 
Airbus plans to increase production in their single-aisle 320 series later this year. Boeing plans to increase production in their 777 and newly upgraded 747-8 aircraft during the next two years. In addition, Boeing continues to report that flight test of their new 787 Dreamliner and upgraded 787 are going well. First deliveries are expected by the end of 2010. 
Last week, Boeing said they plan to make an announcement during the second quarter regarding a possible increase to their 737 single-aisle production rates. And by the end of this year, both commercial airframe makers plan and decide on, first, a new single aisle, or an updated re-engine of their existing single-aisle aircraft. 
We liked the way ATI is positioned to benefit from these aircraft production rate increases of both legacy and the new airplanes. We also are very well positioned to benefit from the next generation airframe and jet engine programs. First, both engines and airframes are big parts of our business. We have had strategic relationships with most of the key players. We have continued to improve the strategic position with new and expanded long-term contracts and with innovative new products. We have new and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities, which, when coupled with our innovative new products, enable us to grow faster as well as larger in this growing aerospace and defense market sector. 
We like the sector trends, particularly the trend to new lightweight aircraft powered by innovative new engines. We like the trend to near net shapes, which helps our customers improve their buy-to-fly ratio, improve their parts-making productivity and reduce their cost of making parts. Near net shapes also provide ATI the opportunity to do more value-added processing through both our Flat-Rolled Products and Long Products businesses. For example, certain titanium long product near net shapes. 
We start by melting the raw materials into an ingot, forging a billet, hot rolling a bar and then hot rolling a shape. We sell the ingots, we sell the billets, we sell the bars and we sell further value-added near net shapes. In the rock products, mill products, near net shapes begin with melting raw materials to an ingot for long products, or slab for flat-rolled products. We like this trend. 
International aerospace market continues to grow. Going out further in the decade, the new Comac, Bombardier and Mitsubishi have announced plans to introduce new aircraft that use future-generation jet engines that are under development, such as GE's LeapX and Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbo Fan. 
Also, ATI will continue to benefit from the new designs in future airframes, or from modifications and redesigns in existing airframes that use our specialty alloys, as well as from the re-engine of legacy aircraft. Our specialty metals are being put on the front of the wagon, while other's materials are rolling off the back. Lastly, the need to up armor and lightweight land-based military vehicles opens new doors through design for our latest alloys and products to protect our service men and women. 
Now turning to the Oil and Gas markets. The world continues to use and need more energy, as developing and advanced nations grow their per capita GDP and their citizens move to modern conveniences and life improvement. According to a respected industry source, to meet growing global demand, ""We need to find and get into production one new Saudi Arabia every three years.""  
Oil and gas exploration has moved to extremely demanding locations, such as deepwater offshore and to unconventional sources, such as shale gas and LNG deep in the earth. These environments require the strong and highly corrosive resistant alloys that we have invented and make today. 
Here are some facts that indicate ATI's first quarter 2010 penetration and performance in this oil and gas market. Sales to this market increased by nearly 50% compared to a year ago, and increased by approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter 2009. Nearly 50% of our first quarter sales to the oil and gas market were direct international sales. It's a global market for us. We not only like the growth in rig count, we also like the faster-than-ten growth in wells associated with shale gas and high-pressure, high-temperature exploration and production. 
Offshore projects continue to be engineered around the globe. And ATI is well positioned to benefit. We're improving our position with our existing key customers, adding new customers, becoming more global and seeing good growth in our innovative products, such as our family of super duplex and lean duplex stainless alloys, for umbilical subsea applications and top-side applications, in our Data 2 [Datalloy 2] non-magnetic specialty alloy for drill strings and horizontal drilling, particularly in shale gas. We expect our shipments to the oil and gas market to continue to improve and to grow throughout 2010.
Finally, a quick update on our remaining strategic capital projects. We are pleased with the startup of our Rowley, Utah premium titanium sponge facility. We're operating more reduction furnaces and developing standard processes. This is a very big project, so we plan to ramp up the production throughout 2010 in a systematic manner. 
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty melt shop is progressing on schedule. We reduced the footprint, and we expect considerable cost savings and its production efficiencies from this project when it is fully operational later this year. We expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions associated with this project, again, beginning in the second half of 2010. 
We are now in the critical final vendor selection process for our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania advanced hot-rolling and processing facility. All permits are in hand. The site preparation work is nearly completed. Overall, we expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $375 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, a final comment. First of all, our first quarter performance, operating performance, as well as execution, as well as improving order entry for most of our products, reinforces our view that 2010 will be a year of steady, quarter-on-quarter improvement. We continue to believe 2010 is the transition year from 2009's global contraction to the resumption of secular growth trends previously achieved in our key global markets. 
We expect to recover and then grow faster than our core global markets because we have an improved market position as demonstrated by our improving volume and forward load, new customers and expanded LTAs, innovative new product offerings, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities, and finally, a globally focused reach that, combined with the solid reputation of ATI and a solid international customer base in our key growth markets, allows us to grow rapidly. 
I think with those comments, operator, we'll now open up the call for any questions."

So the certification process doesn't begin until we have standard processes in place, a standard process that would be used across all of our 36 -- not chipsets, but production sets. So the first step in this is to get the process standardized, standardized work, if you will. Then the second part of that is determined by producing a lot of material in different sizes, mostly small sizes that we will use in different kinds of applications, that we will certify those applications before it goes into anything in a jet engine. And so that process usually takes another year. So we're really talking about getting this plant to full certification in the next 18 months."

But in the High Performance Metal section, our lead times have been expanding as we move throughout the quarter. So depending on the product area, it's two to eight weeks longer than it was at the first of the year. So depending on how far downstream you want to go into a bar or a shape versus, say, an ingot, those product schedules are out on a considerable basis. I think I also mentioned that we're basically full at the current utilization rates for the second quarter. So you keep moving those out, which says that we'll be adding more utilization back into the business, and we'll be taking more product in the second half of the year. I think I also mentioned, I think, Danny told me three times in this talk, so I'll mention it the fourth time, that we expect pricing improvements in the second half."

So I think, the bad news and the good news, the bad news is that they didn't order the parts when they could have got them in a smoothing type of schedule. The good news is that the business is picking up and people are trying to do some restocking as well as keeping up with the build rates. The very good news is the build rates are going to go up. The best news is that the 787 is going to get built and they are going to bring a lot of white tails up to sell at the end of period of time.

But when we look at the best estimates of many of the people that make estimates on raw materials, we still see, for example in nickel, 300 million pounds on the LME [London Metal Exchange]. So we're pretty confident, based on forecast from third parties, what we see that happened last year, other kinds of things, that will be some moderation from this rapid rise. In contrast to that, while this rapid rise in surcharges and volume has been taking place, there's been extremely little movement in base prices or on the conversion price. So the history has been, as these things level out and plateau or moderate or come down, then it's an opportunity to try to recover the prices that should be in effect for the amount of volume and market conditions on the conversion side. So my guess is that we'll see base prices move up and some moderation on the surcharge mechanisms."

We have improved our melt shop situation with the commodity melt shop and a specialty melt shop of both electrical steel and our nickel-based alloys and ingot casting, where we will, before the end of this year, in the second half, close a complete footprint down. So it isn't really the same company. We've been able to demonstrate over the last year, when business was really, really bad, very low utilization rates that we were still able to make some money even under the worst of market conditions.

A large piece of that from an earnings standpoint was obviously offset by significant LIFO inventory reserve charges, since most of our inventory's on LIFO. But I think going forward, we would agree that we might turn out to be wrong. But we would agree that the amount of speculation that was going on in 2007 that drove raw material costs high, that those levels is unlikely to repeat itself. But what we do believe is that, in addition, all the cost reductions that Pat has alluded to and the capabilities we have from a manufacturing and a capacity standpoint, the amount of business and focus that we have globally, the diversification of the company, the capacities and the value-add focus that we have, we do believe that those kind of earnings that we achieved in the last cycle are achievable in the next cycle in just a different way. They won't be driven by some of the raw material cost volatility. It will be driven by higher value-added products, a different cost structure, increased volume. One of the things that we've said that we didn't have in place in 2007 that we will have in place as these markets grow going forward is the capability of producing 60 million pounds of titanium mill products in the kind of a product mix focus that we want that we didn't have that capability before. And with the 787 ramp up in the industrial markets and the use of titanium in oil and gas, those opportunities, we believe, will be there. And in addition, we think in that time period, we'll begin to see some of the demand growth from some markets that really weren't present in 2007 like nuclear."

You also have to look at titanium and titanium sponge, and you know what the public comments are about the contractual sponge prices year-over-year. So that, combined with mix, becomes pretty, pretty big drivers of the LIFO assumption. I think that as -- you know how we do LIFO. I mean, we are projecting what we believe our year-end cost will be, year end being based upon our inventory turns, essentially the last quarter of the year across the businesses by individual pool to come up with a current-year index, and that apply to the LIFO calculation. And the projection of year-end FIFO inventory determines what the full year LIFO reduction or increase on the reserve will be, and then we take that ratably on a quarterly basis, so we'll update that every quarter. Our view here at the end of the first quarter is that, as we've said, that raw material cost will moderate. To the extent that they don't, obviously, that would be impacted in our revised assumption as we go on, on a quarterly basis. Having said that, to the extent that they don't, I think that you'll see FIFO [first-in, first-out] profits increase as well. So how that plays against the LIFO-reserve change would remain to be seen. But I don't think, at this point in time, it would be a significant driver one way or another, but we'll see. It all depends on what raw material costs do."

First of all, we're governed obviously by the accounting rules in terms of how to deal with the diluted calculation on the convertible, and it's very fact specific depending upon the company. So the drivers of that for us are the earnings, obviously, the tax rate and the interest expense on the convertible that's flowing through the income statement on a quarterly basis. And in our case, that's also impacted by the fact that we capitalized a portion of our total interest expense under the accounting rules because of the construction and progress on our long-term capital projects. So the bottom line is, when you put all of those factors in as it pertains to ATI, on a quarterly basis, using the 98 million share count, which excludes the convertible effect, basically, our earnings per share has to be at or about $0.25 a share in the quarter before the convertible issuance is considered dilutive. So because we're below $0.25, if we were above that, then we would have had to assume that the convertible shares were in fact converted, which would increase our diluted shares up to about 108 million shares. But then we would also have to add back to the reported GAAP net income a portion of the interest expense that's associated with that converted because the convert assumes that equity, not debt. But we would have to adjust that for the amount of prorated amount of interest that we've capitalized. So that's a long answer. But the real impact, the real threshold, is if you're at or below $0.25 a share using the 98 million shares, it would be anti-dilutive and therefore not included."

Our strategy has been to target certain markets that we believe deliver long-term secular growth trends that are greater than GDP. The fundamentals of these markets remain intact, even during a time of general economic uncertainty, primarily here in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of growth.
Here are some highlights of our second quarter 2010 performance. Sales were up 17% over last quarter to over $1billion. Earnings improved $0.36 per share, which includes nearly $9 million of start-up and idle facility costs and an additional $5.5 million LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge. Shipments of most of our products reached their highest levels in six quarters.
Order entry for our High Performance Metals segment products from the aerospace and oil and gas markets continue to improve with lead times extending into the fourth quarter.
ATI is not immune from short-term economic conditions. Caution and uncertainty best describe our stainless business, which is primarily driven by U.S. and global economic conditions.
Some additional second quarter highlights. We remained focused on improving our cost structure with over $35 million of gross cost reductions in the second quarter bringing our year-to-date total to $72 million.
Total titanium shipments, including conversion of our Uniti Titanium joint venture were 9.7 million pounds in the second quarter. This brings 2010 total titanium shipments to nearly 19 million pounds.
During the second quarter, titanium shipments increased 17% or over 1 million pounds compared to the first quarter of 2010 in our High Performance Metal segment from improved demand in the aerospace market. Flat-Rolled Products’ titanium shipments including Uniti joint venture conversion products were about 2.6 million pounds.
Our direct international sales increased over 35% of sales in the second quarter. Today, ATI is more globally focused on markets than ever before.
We continue to introduce innovative new products and achieve several major new product milestones in the second quarter. We announced the first long-term agreement for the use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications.
ATI 718Plus alloy is the first new nickel based super alloy introduced to the jet engine market in at least 40 years. We believe this is the first of many applications of this innovative new product.
Our game-changing high-strength titanium ATI 425 alloy was introduced to the aerospace and defense market during the AeroMat Technical Conference, and the Eurosatory, the European Defense Conference.
We recently concluded a year long program to characterize the mechanical properties of ATI 425 alloy. Results have been approved and this proprietary alloy is now certified for a broad application in the aerospace industry.
Customer interest in this new product is strong, particularly for the newly certified sheet product. The aerospace and defense industries now have for the first time a high strength titanium alloy that is available in long length sheet coils.
The industry now has for the first time a high strength titanium alloy that is cold-rollable and cold-formable. These attributes are expected to significantly reduce the full cost of producing parts made of high strength titanium.
At last week’s Farnborough Air Show, our technical and marketing people met with many existing and new customers, who are considering this new product. We now have a long list of customers, some new to ATI, who are interested in ATI 425 alloy.
The protocol for introduction to the market goes like this. First, design allowables approve for sheet and plate, this is done. Second, results approved for addition in the Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization Hand Book Number 6, a prerequisite for broad application of this alloy in the aerospace industry, this is done.
Three, testing by customers for various applications. This is now ongoing with increased interest, and lastly customer specifies the ATI 425 alloy for specific end uses. We believe that this is coming potentially in a big way. How do we see the impact of ATI 425 alloy? It has created market pull.
Customers want to design with it. ATI 425 alloy is a replacement for 6-4 titanium, the most common high-strength titanium alloy. In addition, we believe substitution opportunities exist beyond titanium alloys.
We believe ATI 425 alloy has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental revenue for ATI.
Now, let’s turn to our key markets. Sentiment has changed dramatically in the aerospace markets since the first quarter of 2010. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced they plan to increase their production schedules. At last week’s Farnborough Air Show, optimism was high. A significant number of new orders were added to backlogs that were already at record levels.
Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew into the show and was available for tours. All eyes were on that plane when it took off and left the show on Tuesday. Throughout 2009, when the aerospace supply chain was destocking, we had said that we expected the aerospace market to recover in 2010. That scenario was playing out for ATI even better than we had expected as aircraft build rates are increasing.
Those who visited the ATI aerospace stand at the air show saw the progress we are making in growing our share in this important market. For the first time, we displayed jet engine parts made with our new ATI 718Plus alloy.
Second; our new high-strength titanium ATI 425 alloy in samples of continuous cold-rolled sheet formed plate and prototype aerospace fasteners, a display of ATI Powder Metals products. Remember we recently acquired this business in late 2009. Lastly, new cutting system designed to improve the productivity of machining, difficult to machine materials, such as titanium alloys and nickel-based super alloys.
In addition during an air show event, ATI Allvac was recognized by Rolls-Royce and presented with the Chief Procurement Officer award. According to Rolls-Royce, this honor was awarded to ATI Allvac ‘After successfully reducing overall product costs and contributing toward our environmental responsibilities by limiting the usage of natural resources the company. ATI Allvac has also made sustained investment in the state-of-the-art facilities that have embedded lean practices.’
During the oil and gas market, we continue to make progress in improving our position in this global market.
First, first half sales were 70% higher than the first half of 2009, and over 40% of first half sales to this market were international. While current and future production regulation in the Gulf of Mexico is uncertain, global oil rig count is steadily increasing, driven in large part by unconventional gas such as the Marcellus Shale here in Western Pennsylvania and the tar sands in Canada.
Demand remained strong for our specialty flat-rolled products, our nickel-based alloys or completion tools, our specialty alloy for drill collars and our tungsten drill products.
The investments we’ve made in our Sheffield U.K. facility to melt and machine-engineered products are now paying off.
Demand is strong for our proprietary Datalloy 2 drill collars and our ATI 718-OP nickel-based alloy completion tools and for other ATI nicked-based alloys.
Looking ahead, we continue to improve our position in the oil and gas market with innovative new products and new global customers. In addition, several very large oil and gas projects in Asia and in the Middle East are moving forward. Orders for our materials are expected to be placed later this year.
In the electrical energy market, demand for our grain-oriented electrical steel products remained relatively flat. Demand from the nuclear electrical energy market continues to improve.
The medical market reached over 5% of first half 2010 sales. Biomedical manufacturers continue to purchase at a brisk pace. Demand was strong for our niobium, titanium alloys from the medical equipment market for MRI applications. These are all good signs for ATI products.
Turning to our businesses that are more dependent on the general economy of the United States, second quarter 2010 shipments of our standard stainless sheets and plate products increased 17% compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Industry data reflects service center inventories remain at a seasonally adjusted rate of just 2.8 months, which is still historically low. In addition, customers see no reason to purchase more than they need even though average base prices are low because the surcharges are declining.
The benchmark 304 stainless surcharge was $1.27 per pound in June. It is $1.08 per pound in July. It will be $0.96 per pound in August, and it is expected to be approximately $0.94 per pound in September based upon current moderating raw material prices. That is a $0.34 per pound or 27% drop in the surcharge since the yearly high set in June.
In addition, the summer months are normally seasonally slower for our stainless business. So customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude until raw material prices stabilize. Finally, it’s important to note that we do not believe end use demand for our stainless products is deteriorating.
Moving to our strategic capital projects, we have continued to invest in unsurpassed manufacturing. The ramp up process at our Rowley, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. We plan to continue to ramp production throughout 2010 in a systematic manner.
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania melt shop is essentially complete. We reduced our footprint and we expect considerable cost savings and production efficiencies from this project when it is fully operational. We expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions associated with this project beginning later this year. The full impact of the project begins in 2011
On June 21, we announced that ATI has selected Siemens VAI to design, engineer and supply the hot rolling mill at our Brackenridge, PA facility. We believe our new hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of our unique range of mission critical metallics.
The state-of-the-art facility is designed to further transform our Flat-Rolled Products segment’s operating performance across all business cycles. We now expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $325 million.
Before we open the call for questions, a last comment about the third quarter and the second half of 2010, in the second half, we expect our High Performance Metals segment to improve quarter-on-quarter at about 7% to 8%. We see the aerospace market and this segment’s other markets beginning to accelerate throughout 2011 to a robust level in 2012 and beyond.
Our Engineered Products segment businesses continue to improve. We expect a lower third quarter due to normal seasonality, particularly the August vacation period in Europe. Growth should resume in the fourth quarter and continue into 2011.
In the third quarter, our Flat-Rolled Products segment is experiencing raw material costs to out-of-phase surcharges from the rapid decline in nickel prices from the second quarter highs. Lower volume from the wait-and-see attitude by service center and end-use customers are affecting this unit’s performance.
These conditions are expected to significantly reduce third quarter Flat-Rolled Products’ operating profit. However, we expect a rapid rebound in the fourth quarter due to renewed stocking. We do not believe end-use demand for our standard stainless products is deteriorating.
By 2011 and beyond, we expect to grow faster than our core global markets because we have improved our market position from improving volume and forward load, new customers and expanded LTAs, innovation of new products, new and technically advanced manufacturing capabilities, and finally a global focus combined with a solid reputation and internal customer base in key growth markets.
With this opening comment, we’d now like to turn the call open for any questions.

I think the third quarter will be down. We’ve talked about these issues before. And I think you’ve seen this from some of the other reporting companies, is to have a rapidly dropping nickel, basically nickel surcharge and couple that with lower volume. So you cannot move the metal through your operations at the higher surcharges, so just isn’t enough volume to get it out. So therefore it lingers on through the quarter and will cost money. That’s what the third quarter is going to experience. It’s going to be a down quarter.
At the same time, the customers are doing that, the shelves are destocking because demand remains fairly stable out there. So what we think in the fourth quarter is that we will see the demand come back with also restocking on the shelves to meet the business condition. So if you’re asking me today I would think the fourth quarter would be the best quarter of the year for Flat-Rolled.

The first one is that we had a pretty good business coming back in the jet engine business, which we had talked about earlier and we had forecasted, if you recall, that we did not see any decline in build rates, but, in fact when we looked at the fourth quarter 2009, we thought they would at least be stable. Well, now we have a situation not only with stable but increasing build rates coming and I think you’re seeing the engine makers come back to try to get their inventories in line with what demand that they now see going forward. That’s one issue there.
Our airframe business was pretty much at the minimum levels that we’ve contracted to, so it remained steady. The other growth that we had was in the industrial titanium markets coming back in Asia and in other areas. We even had some business in the defense sector that we had some wins on. So when you put all that together what you find is a pretty robust second quarter for titanium moving up 1 million pounds. But as you look at the mix of more industrial applications, you saw that the pricing stayed relatively stable. We didn’t get the price increase that we wanted overall, but we did get price increases on the aerospace side.

I think we’re going to see jet engine business move rapidly. I think we’re going to see the industrial markets for titanium, especially in some of the oil and gas and desalinization, chemical processing, heat exchangers, nuclear markets begin to ramp pretty well. There is some defense business that looks attractive. I think the airframe business will continue along at about the same pace until the excess inventories begin to be worked off.
So it depends on how fast that they ramp those businesses. Depends on the extra build rates and how fast they ramp for the single-aisles. They all use titanium too and all the engines that are on those programs use the titanium product. So we expect to see this begin to ramp in 2011. As the airframe programs come on stream, the nuclear business moves where we think it’s going to be and the programs that we’re shooting for and some of the other applications that are out there and especially with the new 425 alloy and our business gaining share in the overall market, we see 2012 being a very robust year for us.

But I guess, you’re also indicating that you thought that the quarter for the corporation as a whole might be weaker than the second quarter or were you just talking to the Flat-Rolled business?
Can you give us some color and help reconcile some of the new projects, the cost reduction activity, the growth in high performance business and how you’d reconcile that against this short-term, call it a pause, in a standard flat-rolled business?

The Engineered Products business although we have improving margins with the cutting tool business, basically losing the vacation period in Europe, and we sell about half our cutting tools business in Europe on many of our items. So the cutting tool business is split. We’re going to see that seasonality and vacation schedules in the U.S. So we’re going to see the Engineered Products business even though we’re continuing to improve on pricing and penetration somewhat down, not a lot but, yes.
Then we get to Flat-Rolled Products. Now Flat-Rolled Products as you saw on the first quarter we had a $42 million operating margin we’re not going to get there and these other two segments are not going to offset that division when we start talking about metal mismatches coupled with lower volume. So in the end, we’re talking something lower than the second quarter.

You were down at our tour of the Carolina facility when we showed you the product and showed you how it forms and showed you that product that basically looks like aluminum sheet coil, you can unroll. It’s just really a game changer. So when we look at this, we basically are getting inquires across every mill product segment of the titanium market today. We are basically getting inquiries in every product form that we make, from wire all the way through thick plate. So I could almost say that we don’t know its total potential, but we do know that those markets are basically the entire 6-4 spectrum of mill products in the titanium business.
Now, we know we’re not going to replace 6-4 across the board, but this product is going to take share and it’s going to place us in the business where we have never been before. We came out of the Farnborough Air Show with a list of inquiries and follow-ups that on a spreadsheet take up two full pages of people that wanted to get samples, want us to come talk about it, want us to see what they do, want us to see if we can fit their applications, just coming out of the Farnborough Air Show.
So how fast we go, it’s going to be based on how fast the customer can reengineer to use these products and also how fast we can gear up to get to the volume levels that we’re talking about. Now, when we look at this product, my comment around hundreds of millions of dollars, this is a proprietary product that has a patent on it through around 2017. So when we look at that, we know that this product is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to this corporation and we also know that we’re being pleasantly surprised about people contacting us that are not to replace other materials or in other designs to lightweight their applications that are currently using today steel or alumina.
So because of its formability and its ability to be cold-formed, the total cost, their net size, total cost and availability of sizes and lead times brings this product to the forefront of the new application across all of our market segments. So I can’t tell you what it is but, Chris, you have a good head for numbers and applications, the question is how fast does it come and how fast can we get these things into place. We have the characterizations done. We have the Mil-Handbook-6 for aerospace complete. We have people testing it now. So it’s a question of how many hits and how fast we can ramp up.

It is not going to happen in the second half, but it’s a sizeable growth when you compare it to anything else in the U.S. markets.
We’re double, triple GDP growth of there.

The LIFO side, as you know, we reevaluate that every quarter based upon where we think raw material costs, primarily raw material costs, but it’s all the costs, its labor and overhead to come up with the current year index. But it’s really primarily driven by raw material costs. So we’ll reevaluate where we think raw material costs will be at the end of the year. If that reevaluation is consistent with our assumptions that we’re making today, the $5.5 million is a catch-up, because we didn’t book anything in the first quarter.

It’s dependent upon the surcharges and it’s dependent upon the base price. I think we are seeing, first of all, it’s a combination of volume, which Pat has already addressed and it’s a combination when you look at the kind of volume that in, both Europe and the U.S. and the impact I think that our assumption is that base prices are going to be more competitive in the third quarter than they were in the second quarter. Surcharges will be what they are. That’s very transparent and it’s dependent upon what all the raw material costs fell into our end. Those are fairly well known now because of the two months lag in terms of how the surcharges work.
So it’s primarily volume, some moderation of base prices and product mix, including the difference between high value as well as the standard grade. Then, finally, the biggest impact in the quarter is what we’ve already talked about and that is the surcharge mismatch because of the fairly dramatic fall from the April and May highs of nickel, but also chrome and iron units to what they are today and they how they match up against the surcharge. So, all of that is really driving the impact as we see the flat-rolled products in the third quarter.

Our key global markets are performing well. We’ve seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year to-date 2009. Sales for the first",2014,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone joining us for today’s call. Our key global markets are performing well. We’ve seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year to-date 2009. Sales for the first nine months of 2010 are just $45 million below our sales for all of 2009. We continue to improve the efficiency of our operations.
Cost reductions year-to-date are $102 million. We’ve exceeded our $100 million goal for cost reductions in 2010 and nine months. With a strong cash balance and a strong balance sheet, cash on hand increased to over $443 million. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 23% and total debt to capitalization improved to 34%.
Our strategy has been to target certain market sectors that we believe are in the long term secular growth trends that are greater than the average global GDP. We still see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in those key global markets.
Order entry and optimism has improved from several markets. We recently announced price increases for our nickel based alloys and specialty alloys both in long products and flat rolled products.
In addition, Uniti our industrial titanium joint venture announced a price increase for CP titanium products. Because of extending lead times, these price increases are expected to impact 2011 performance beginning in the first quarter.
As we previously announced, third quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by certain issues. First is a volatile and erratic price of LME traded nickel. We booked a significant LIFO catch up charge in the third quarter. From April to July the average LME nickel price dropped by 26%. From July to October it rose 23%. So we had to change our assumptions and book the charge.
We now expect a full year 2010 LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $54 million. So, the third quarter catch-up charge was an additional $33 million. Currently, we expect a $14 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter 2010.
These LIFO charges mainly impact our flat-rolled product results. In addition, the nickel price movement has been causing unusual buying patterns by some customers, particularly for our standard stainless products.
Shipments in September were surprisingly strong part of this is likely due to customer buying to beat the rising October surcharge. October buying is also strong as customers are trying to beat the November surcharge increase.
While month-on-month shipments are choppy, we are seeing recovery. Overall demand for standard stainless products is keeping paced with the modest GDP growth of the U.S. and European economies.
Other issues that impacted the third quarter operating profit are the start-up, idle facility, and major maintenance charges.
High Performance Metals segment operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million of start-up and idle facility, costs associated with our titanium sponge operations. We expect these charges to be similar in the fourth quarter.
By approximately $7 million related to a two-week shutdown of our zirconium facilities to adjust inventory levels and perform major maintenance. We do not expect this charge to continue in the fourth quarter 2010.
Flat-Rolled Products segment operating profit was negatively impacted by $5 million of higher than normal major maintenance expenses. We do not expect such a charge in the fourth quarter 2010. While these start-up costs have been a headwind to 2010 operating profit, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond.
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania melt shop is complete. We reduced our footprint and expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions beginning in 2011.
Our titanium and super alloy forge facility in Bakers, North Carolina continues to obtain customer qualifications and has much needed forging and finishing capacity and capabilities. Timing on completion of this project looks good as demand is strengthening from our aerospace, oil and gas and electrical energy customers.
The ramp up at our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. We are producing sponge and we are now working on standardizing the process and improving yields.
We expect capital expenditures on our new hot rolling and processing facility to begin increasing in the fourth quarter 2010, and we now expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $250 million.
Strength in our key markets is providing the foundation for resumption of strong secular growth beginning in 2011. We believe aerospace remains a long-term growth market for ATI. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced planned increases to their production schedules. Their backlogs are strong and they are being extended by new orders.
Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft rates such as for the 777 are also growing. The 787 has been delayed, but we expect demand from this next generation aircraft to pickup throughout 2011.
For ATI, aero engine demand is being driven by all of the aircraft schedules. In addition, aero engine spares, our spare demand is being driven by a strong recovery in passenger and freight traffic and also the growing size of the global fleet.
Now, turning to the oil and gas market, U.S. and international drill rig counts continue a steady climb driving our order backlogs and pushing out lead times for certain products.
ATI revenue from this market for the first nine months of 2010 has grown by 65% compared to the same period in 2009. In addition direct international sales accounted for 42% of our sales to the oil and gas market during the first nine months of 2010.
We expect this strong demand to continue, we’re seeing opportunities to supply our products, particularly specialty plate for several large global projects.
Demand is strong in our high performance metal segment for our specialty steels used for non-magnetic drill collars and for our nickel-based alloys for completion tools. Demand will improve for our tungsten drilling products.
In the chemical process industry, we’re seeing opportunities for several large sea water desalinization plants that could potentially, significantly drive demand for CP titanium. Titanium is being considered as a substitute for copper nickel alloys in these applications.
In the electrical energy market, demand of our grain-oriented electrical steel products remained relatively flat but at 80% capacity levels for ATI. Demand from the nuclear electrical energy market, for our zirconium products has remained flat while activity has picked up for specialty alloy plate for spent nuclear fuel storage. Orders improve for our nickel-based super alloys for gas turbines in the quarter.
The medical market reached nearly 6% of sales for the first nine months of 2010. Biomedical sales have been steady at high levels during the year. Demand was strong for our niobium, titanium alloys from the medical equipment market for MRI applications. These are all very good signs for ATI.
ATI is innovating for the future. We are adding innovative new products to improve customer productivity and so that they can make their products better and faster. We have a robust pipeline of new products.
In 2010, we announced the first long term agreement for the use of our new ATI 718 plus alloy for jet engine applications. We expect this innovative new alloy to grow our share in the aero-engine market, particularly as the aircraft build schedules increase.
Following the technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 titanium alloy sheet and plate this summer, the team has seen a rush of technical and material enquiries from the aerospace and defense markets, as well as other high end markets. Customer interest in this new product is strong.
Our customers recognize that total cost solutions this new alloy can provide. Customer testing in the early phases of qualification has gone well. Process qualification adoption of a new alloy in the aerospace business will take about 12 to 18 months.
A prototype application constructive of our new alloys is on display this week at the Army USA Annual Meeting in Washington D.C. If you plan to be there, go to the AM General Display and look for a sign that reads ATI and AM General Survivability Solutions. You will see a blast bucket that is tested and proved and made with our new materials.
We recently added titanium fastener stock to our list of diversified product offerings. ATI now provides titanium alloy as well as nickel and specialty alloy fastener stock to the aerospace and defense market.
We expect demand from the fastener supply chain to be strong, when and as airframe production ramps up to meet the new build schedules. We also recently commercialized another new lean duplex stainless steel.
ATI 2102 lean duplex stainless steel contains even less nickel and moly than our other lean duplex ATI 2003 alloy. This is a global leader with a broad range of super duplex, duplex, and lean alloys. Demand for duplex stainless steel is growing as customers look for alternatives that reduce exposure to high and volatile raw material costs.
ATI Ludlum is working with our new ATI Powder business to develop a line of borated stainless steels. Borated stainless requires a complex chemistry that is not easily melded, thus the use of powders. These alloys are used for the storage of spent nuclear fuel.
During the first nine months of 2010, we’ve been navigating through some choppiness and uncertainty that often characterizes a recovery year. We see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets. Our new assets and innovative products are setting a solid foundation for growth.
In my personal view, I feel more optimistic today about 2011 than I did at any other time during this year in 2010. We are now seeing more evidence that the strong recovery is underway in our key markets, volume is up, asset utilization is increasing and pushing out lead times. We announced several price increases that we believe will permit us to increase the returns on our available capacity.
ATI is growing our share in these markets with new products. We’re being recognized by new customers as a strategic source to do all that we can now provide and our industry leading quality and service. We’re growing our share through our market sector teams.
We’re better positioned than ever in the aerospace, defense, oil and gas and nuclear energy markets. Because of market demand, we introduced titanium fastener stock and near-net shapes to the aerospace business.
We invested in the machining center at our Sheffield, U.K. facility and we’re now providing fully machined drill collars and other products to the oil and gas market. Demand has been terrific for this product and lead times are pushed out well into 2011. These new assets are also capable of machining our products for the aerospace and defense industry.
The actions we have taken allow us to improve our share and grow faster than the markets we’ve identified that have secular growth trends that are greater than the global average GDP.
Frankly, we feel very good about 2011 and beyond. However, factors beyond our control really impact our short-term visibility. Because of so much uncertainty, particularly in the U.S., and the volatility of many raw material prices, we cannot predict the actions of our customers particularly in the final weeks of this year, it is just uncertain.
For example, will customers add inventory, maintain current inventory levels or reduced or their actions be impacted in the short-term by the uncertainty of the lame duck Congress, actions by the Federal Reserve, uncertain regulatory environment or other outside or internal factors of their business? The answer to that is I just don’t know.
What I do have is a strong conviction that 2011 will be far better for ATI than 2010. That 2012 will be better than 2011, and that 2013 continues and will be far better than 2012. So we have a very optimistic view of the long-term prospects, starting next year and beginning to go forward. I think that’s enough comments from me and we’ll open up the meeting now for any questions anyone might have.

Thyssen is just starting up those facilities, as you know, they have a fairly strong position in the U.S. today, with their Mexinox operations and also imports coming in from Europe and other areas through Canada into the country. So this whole facility in our view in Alabama is to streamline our operations and to bring stainless into their market that they already have a large share of today. So they’re starting up their first mill.
What they’re doing, as we’ve heard at this point in time is, it’s a test, they’re taking basically small orders. They’re not trimming the order or looking for confirmation of the quality out of this piece of equipment and they are basically in a cold rolling stage. They are actually bringing in white coils out of Germany. So they are not even being hot rolled. Eventually they’ll be bringing in slab from Germany to roll here and they’ll roll it on their new hot rolling facilities and then they’ll finish it in their cold rolling facilities. We think Thyssen is a good competitor. I think they are a good company. They provide a good product and I don’t think it changes much in the U.S. market except for their cost structure.
The second question on Boeing restocking. I don’t know if there is a restocking issue, but Boeing has certainly a growing issue. So what we see is that these airplane programs are booked to the future. They are going to continue to ramp. We have a situation next year that the 787 for all practical purposes is going to ramp up throughout 2011. They are increasing their production in their single isles going forward in the 777, in the 747-8.
So whatever inventories that they have on hand, those inventories are going to be coming down. In our particular circumstances, we have agreements to supply that customer at certain levels. Those agreements call for take or pay volumes at certain levels and prices and so we will be producing at least to those volumes as we go forward.
I think there is also good possibilities that as the rest of the titanium business as we see it begins to ramp on these new projects throughout the world that continuing supplies will start to see prices moving up, scrap prices are moving up. Now I think one supplier just announced price increases for next year on sponge, we see rising scrap prices in our own domestic markets which make our investments in sponge look better to us every day.
So, I think as this market ramps up Boeing is going to be very happy. They have any excess inventory on hand as the market ramps up for the production levels that we see coming throughout the industry, not just the aerospace industry, but throughout the world including the desalination projects, chemical processing, projects that we are now seeing coming on the books and being asked for and starting in 2011, 2012, 2013. So, we feel pretty good about the overall supply demand relationship regardless of Boeing.

It looks like our mill product shipments including unities conversion and in 2010 are going to approach quantities in the high 30s. So, we’re going to have 37 million, 38 million pounds of final production ship this year. That number is going to increase substantially as we look at production in 2011. We are talking volumes way up in double-digits.
So, we need sponge and we need the production out of Rowley and we also have a fairly large amount of production coming in from outside the company which we’ve always said that we’re going to do because we do not have enough have sponge on hand to handle our own fully loaded product lines. We still see titanium moving up into quantities over these next ‘11, ‘12 and ‘13, but we think we’ll be shipping 60 million pounds of finished product, including our Uniti joint ventures. So, you see where we’re coming from in overall sponge capacity. We will continue to buy on the outside.
So, with the Rowley facility our goal is to get that plant up and running, rotating quality, making rotating quality sponge. In order to do that we have to have a standardized process that is in control and capable of producing rotating quality each and every day of the week across all 36 sets of units there. So, where we are today? We’re in production. We are still continuing to develop that process, but we feel that we have it in control with capable and locked in on making rotating quality parts, until we have that process locked in then the product that we are producing goes to lower grade products such as B quality, or aircraft frame quality, or industrial quality titanium.
So there is two things that are happening, we are locking in the processes we need to produce the rotating quality. We’re getting the equipment and its capable and under control and we are working on ways to make sure that we have the right yields and the right recoveries out of what we are doing. So, this is a process that we’re continuing to improve. Hopefully, early next year we’ll have what we want in place and we’ll begin the qualification process for rotating quality.

I think we’re seeing nickel growing into the fourth quarter and we’re going to see titanium kind of staying flat and up in the aero-engine side, down in the airframe side, through the end of the year.
A lot of this is determined by needs of customers into the first quarter so answering your second part about the first quarter, we think that we’re going to ramp fairly quickly next year into these higher quantities beginning early in the year and we kind of look at the fourth quarter as I mentioned earlier ending the year somewhere 37 million pound to 38 million pound. So we shipped 29 million so far including conversion work. It’s just back and forth between forms whether it’s going to be sheet, plate, and rounds whatever. So its mix and its end markets we’re supplying a lot of metal outside the aerospace market these days. So oil and gas, its chemical processing, its airframe, its aero engine.

We’ve obviously, seen interest rates come down over the course of the year, but depending upon what happens with the Fed and what happens with interest rate between now and the end of the year, we will see where that comes out. Obviously, declining interest rates are not helpful to us from a pension expense standpoint, but to some extent those are somewhat offset by what happens on the asset side.

I think what we don’t know quite frankly is where the customer behavior pattern will be and Pat articulated the uncertainty I think that exists in the short-term, you see where the average number of months inventory is on the stainless side, it’s really pretty low. So, customers are reacting near-term to a fairly longer lead times on the stainless sides than they were maybe nine months ago, but certainly still fairly short lead times.
So, I think our view of the fourth quarter is that the issues that we’re dealing with are the same ones that the customers are dealing with and we’re going to have some costs that we incurred in the third quarter that won’t be there in the fourth quarter, Pat articulated those and those are all in our earnings release.

We have now seen in 2010 the return of volume to fairly good levels and we’re anticipating very good double digit growth next year in the overall titanium market. I also mentioned that there is now projects outside of aerospace that will take very, very large volumes of sponge and melting and finished product in order to supply and they are coming from all over the world. Mostly out of Asia, and the Mid East. So these are big new projects that change the dynamics of that industry.
I think changing dynamic will be the price of scrap and as you look at the price of scrap that will influence the overall price of what sponge will sell for on a spot basis. So those two things in the past, I think we can presumably to price increases both in the surcharge, in the demand and in the pricing of the product. We have seen them move rapidly in the past in very short periods of time. So I am not going to predict what the pricing could be, but I will reiterate anyone that has inventories of titanium will probably be glad to have them, as they move into next year.

Two, the industrial markets for titanium are growing very rapidly on a global basis, as I’ve mentioned several times here or so. Scrap is going to go into that kind of a market. Now, in actual changes we ended the year with bulk-weldable solid scrap around $3.50 a pound. I think the latest buy we have made is $7, $7 for processed bulk-weldable scrap.
So the fact of the matter is the market tells you it’s in short supply. I don’t care what anybody else says, when you got $7 of bulk-weldables it’s different than in January, like twice as much. We know that business is increasing next year in the double-digit rate, so this is going to get somewhat shorter. We on our own revered paths have locked in pads so that the scrap that we generate through our total value chain much of it will come back to us and not go to the open market. So we have all those factors sitting out there.
I think the other determination as to how much supply is at any particular customer is there is a key phrase in there that we have to work on and I don’t have any better understanding than you do, but the phrase goes like this. I have this much supply under current build rates. So, I am using so much today, and if I add it all together that’s how long it’s going to take me to get down to the level I want.
When I look at increasing build rates or a new program coming on or, for example, let’s just use one customer like the 175 new F-15’s, I think it’s F-15 or F-18. F-18 is out of St. Louis that were unexpected those are all titanium bulkheads and things like that. Does that change your time to move inventories? All these things have some assumptions in them.
So, our information, what I am giving you is some color as I think that titanium is getting momentum, scrap prices are up, we know that production will be up and there is some big projects out there that will as they come through, can really change the dynamics of the whole thing.

We are going to have some ramp up costs in the sense of bringing people on and training them, but I think we’ll have the process where we want it to be, let’s say, somewhere around the end of the first quarter next year. So that will go away.
The operations and consolidation of Brackenridge are complete. We’re really thrilled of what we have there. In fact, we’re seeing some of those savings today at the Breckenridge plant. The way we’re operating the plant on the new hot mill complex is that it’s a totally separate part of the plant, it’s fenced off and the older part of the plant is operating independent of the new facilities. So that will have no interference or cost factors to the new side of the plant. As time goes forward on the super alloy forging facility, it’s just a matter of getting more products qualified, so we can use the facility for every end product that we would like to use it for. But I think the cost to start up over there is just a question of qualification.

We’re also working on some high hard steels for armor applications.
So, I think the armor market is a relatively new market for ATI. It’s one that we are focused on from a market sector team standpoint. I think initially at least the applications will be high hard steels and ATI 425 and possibly 6-4 plate, as well. Armor applications primarily plate but also the possibility of some of our casting product that comes out of our Wah Chang operations in high performance metals.

I think that certainly the margins that we are making today in that segment aren’t what we expect to make in the ‘11, ‘12, ‘13 time frame as we look at the full spectrum of the capabilities we have both in nickel and titanium and specialty alloys and exotic alloys. But I think that the margin dollars if you will, I think we’ve said this before.
Despite what we said earlier, we’re not planning for titanium scrap to be $20 a pound again, like it was in ‘07, but you know what, it may be, who knows. If it is, we pay that eventually, but you have a timing element there, perhaps where you have a short-term advantage. I think that the margin growth and earnings per share growth are going to be a combination of a richer product mix, new products, including powder, higher volumes.
And the benefits of all the cost reductions that we’ve put into these business over the years, and the new products we’re talking about are not only the development of the powder business, but also fastener stock in all alloy systems, not just nickel, but also titanium.
And the end market growth, all of which Pat has talked about earlier. I think as you saw from us the last time, I think we made some prognostications before the last ramp-up of where we would have expect those segment margins to be, and we blew through them. So, I think the one thing you can rest assured of that the margins will be as good as we can make them, but the earnings will come from a variety of different sources.

The interesting part about getting to near net size is unless you change, completely change the product form, some place along the supply chain, the same pounds are being made. For example, you have this new machining joint venture with VSMPO and Boeing. I am assuming, Boeing is buying from that joint venture and buying much more near net sizes, but VSMPO still has to produce the same amount of product in order to get it into that form. The same amount of metal in the industry is being used, even though Boeing may not be buying it in that form.
The same thing with us, as Boeing comes in and ask for near net size shapes, we actually have improved margins on that product, even though it may be less pounds that they are buying from us, but when we look at the total amount of sponge that we cast, the total going into the melt, into the ingot to make that product, we are still making those units and using those capacities to produce a near net size that is closer for the customer to buy and then we charge more for that product, but it takes the same utilization out of the industry.
So it’s a very complex thing to really understand. It isn’t that the airplane in the total value chain will take less metal. It’s the customer at the end is buying different products that he is buying less metal for more money. The total value chain is still producing basically the same amount of product. So that’s one way to look at it.
I think in terms of pricing, our price increases that we just recently announced, and we just recently announced and we just recently announced on the base price and also that’s the transaction business, and also on our surcharges are pretty well set for the fourth quarter. Those kind of announcements are for product that’s currently being booked into the first quarter of next year not the fourth quarter of this year.

They were going to take the product if we have surcharges that are higher in January than in December. If they have their issues from whatever sources inside or outside or government regulations, taxes. This is just a quarter that is difficult and foggy.
We don’t want to get into giving guidance in this quarter other than what we’ve said and we’ve had a very thorough news release that gives you all the issues. We said there’s going to be, as we know, continuing start-up costs on the primary side, and it also says that we shouldn’t have any more one-time issues that we know of today. The commodity side, the LIFO side is a wildcard. We have our own trajectory today. We’ve got that trajectory at a $14 million LIFO reserve charge, but that could move around too.

Sales for the first",1995,"Thanks, Dan and thank you, everyone for joining us on today's call. Our key global markets are performing well. We've seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year-to-date 2009. Sales for the first 9 months of 2010  are just $45 million below our sales for all of 2009. We continue to improve the efficiency of our operations. Cost reductions year-to-date are $102 million. We've exceeded our $100 million goal for cost reductions in 2010 in 9 months. We have a strong cash balance and strong balance sheet. Cash on hand increased to over $443 million. Net debt to total capitalization improved 23% and total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. Our strategy has been to target certain market sectors that we believe are in the long-term secular growth trends that are greater than the average global GDP. We still see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in those key global markets. Order entry and optimism from -- has improved from several markets. We recently announced price increases for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys, both in long products and flat-rolled products. In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, announced a price increase for CP titanium products. Because of extending lead times, these price increases are expected to impact 2011 performance beginning in the first quarter. As we previously announced, third quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by certain issues. First is the volatile and erratic price of LME traded nickel. We booked a significant LIFO catch-up charge in the third quarter. From April to July, the average LME nickel price dropped by 26%. From July to October, it rose 23%. So we had to change our assumptions and booked the charge. We now expect a full year 2010 LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $54 million. For the third quarter, catch-up charge was an additional $33 million. Currently, we expect a $14 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. These LIFO charges mainly impact our flat-rolled product results.
In addition, the nickel price movement has been causing unusual buying patterns by some customers, particularly for our standard products. Shipments in September were surprisingly strong. Part of this is likely due to customer buying to beat the rising October surcharge. October buying is also strong as customers are trying to beat the November surcharge increase. While month-on-month shipments are choppy, we are seeing recovery. Overall demand for standard stainless products is keeping pace with the modest GDP growth of the U.S. and European economies.
Other issues that impacted the third quarter operating profit are the startup, idle facility and major maintenance charges. High-performance metals segment operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million of startup and idle facility costs associated with our titanium sponge operations. We expect these charges to be similar in the fourth quarter and by approximately $7 million related to a 2-week shutdown of our zirconium facilities to adjust inventory levels and perform major maintenance. We do not expect this charge to continue in the fourth quarter 2010. 
Flat-Rolled Products segment operating profit was negatively impacted by $5 million of higher than normal major maintenance expenses. We do not expect such a charge in the fourth quarter 2010. While these startup costs have been a headwind for 2010 operating profit, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. 
Melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania melt shop is complete. We reduced the footprint and expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions beginning in 2011. Our titanium and superalloy forge facility in Brackenridge, North Carolina continues to obtain customer qualification and adds much-needed forging and finishing capabilities. Timing on completion of this project looks good as demand is strengthening from our Aerospace oil and gas and Electrical Energy customers. The ramp-up at our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. We are producing sponge and we are now working on standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect capital expenditures on our new hot rolling and processing facility to begin increasing in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we now expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $250 million.
Strength in our key markets is providing the foundation for resumption of strong secular growth beginning in 2011. We believe aerospace remains a long-term growth market for ATI. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced planned increases to their production schedules. Their backlogs are strong and they are being extended by new orders. Single-alloy aircraft production rates are growing. Double-alloy aircraft rates, such as for the 777, are also growing. the 787 has been delayed but we expect demand from this next generation aircraft to pick up throughout 2011. For ATI, the airline demand is being driven by all of the aircraft schedules. In addition, Aero engines spare demand is being driven by a strong recovery in passenger and freight traffic and also the growing size of a global fleet.
Now turning to the oil and gas market. U.S. and international drill rig counts continue a steady climb, driving our order backlog and pushing up lead times for certain products. ATI revenue for this market for the first 9 months of 2010 has grown by 65% compared to the same period in 2009. In addition, direct international sales accounted for 42% of our sales to the oil and gas market during the first 9 months of 2010. We expect this strong demand to continue. We're seeing opportunities to supply our products, particularly specialty plate, for several large global projects. Demand is strong in our High Performance Metals segment for our specialty steels used for non-magnetic drill collars and for our nickel-based alloys for completion tools. Demand has also improved for our tungsten drilling products. In the Chemical Process industry, we're seeing opportunities for several large seawater desalinization plants that could potentially, significantly drive demand for CP titanium. Titanium has been considered as a substitute for copper nickel alloys in these applications.
In the Electrical Energy market, demand of our grain-oriented electrical steel products remained relatively flat but add 80% capacity levels for ATI. Demands for the nuclear Electrical Energy market for our zirconium products has remained flat, while activity has picked up for specialty alloy plate for fuel storage. Orders improved for nickel-based super alloys for gas turbines in the quarter.
The medical market reached nearly 6% of sales for the first 9 months of 2010. Biomedical sales had been steady at high levels during the year. Demand was strong for our niobium titanium alloys from the medical equipment market for MRI applications. These are all very good signs for ATI. ATI is innovating for the future. We're adding innovative new products to improve customer productivity and so that they can make their products better and faster. We have a robust pipeline of new products. In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for the use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. We expect this innovative new alloy to grow our share in the aeroengine market, particularly as the aircraft build schedules increase. Following the technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 titanium alloy sheet and plate this summer, the team has seen a rush of technical and material inquiries from the aerospace defense markets as well as other high end markets. Customer interest in this new product is strong. Our customers recognize the total cost solution this new alloy can provide. Customer testing in the early stages of qualification has gone well. Process qualification adoption of a new alloy in the aerospace business will take about 12 to 18 months. A prototype application constructed of our new alloys is on display this week at the Army USA Annual Meeting in Washington DC. If you plan to be there, go to the AM General Display and look for a sign that reads ATI and AM General Survivability Solutions. You'll see a blast bucket that is tested and proved and made with our new material.
We recently added titanium fasteners stock to our list of diversified product offerings. ATI now provides titanium alloy as well as nickel and specialty alloy fastener stock to the Aerospace and Defense market. We expect demand from the fastener supply chain to be strong, when and as, airframe production ramps up to meet the new build schedules. We also recently commercialized another new lean duplex stainless steel, ATI 2102, lean duplex stainless steel contains even less nickel and moly then our other lean duplex ATI 2003 alloy. This is a global leader with a broad range of super duplex, duplex and lean alloys. Demand for duplex stainless steel is growing as customers look for alternatives that reduce exposure to high and volatile raw material costs. ATI Ludlum is working on our new with our new ATI Power business to develop a line of stainless steel is. stainless requires Complex chemistry that is not easily melted thus the use of powders. These alloys are used for the storage of spent nuclear fuel.
During the first 9 months of 2010, we've been navigating through some choppiness and uncertainty that often characterizes a recovery year. We see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets. Our new assets and innovative products are setting a solid foundation for growth. In my personal view, I feel more optimistic today about 2011, than I did at any other time during this year in 2010. We are now seeing more evidence that a strong recovery is underway in our key markets. Volume is up. Asset utilization is increasing and pushing out lead times. We announced several price increases that we believe will permit us to increase the returns on our available capacity. ATI is growing our share in these markets with new products. We are being recognized by new customers as a strategic source due to all that we can now provide and our industry-leading quality and service. We are growing our share through our market sector teams, who are better positioned than ever in the aerospace, defense, oil and gas and Nuclear Energy markets. Because of the market demand, we introduced titanium fasteners stock and Internet shapes to the aerospace business. We invested in the machining center at our Sheffield U.K. facility and we're now providing fluid machine, drill collars and other products to the oil and gas market. Demand has been terrific for this product and lead times are pushed out well into 2011. These new assets are also capable of machining our products for the Aerospace and Defense industry. The actions we have taken allow us to improve our share and grow faster than the markets we have identified that have secular growth trends that are greater than the global average GDP. Frankly, we feel very good about 2011 and beyond. However, factors beyond our control really impact our short-term visibility. Because of so much uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. and the volatility of many raw material prices, we cannot predict the actions of our customers, particularly in the final weeks of this year. It's just uncertain. For example, will customers add inventory, maintain current inventory levels or reduce? Were there actions impacted in the short-term by the uncertainty actions by the Federal Reserve, uncertain regulatory environment or other outside or internal factors of their business? The answer to that is, I just don't know. What I do have is a strong conviction that 2011 will be far better for ATI than 2010. That 2012 will be better than 2011 and that 2013 continues and will be far better than 2012. So we have a very optimistic view of the long-term prospects starting next year and beginning to go forward. I thank that's enough comments for me and we'll open up the meeting up for any questions anyone might have."

Piston is just starting up those facility. As you know, they have a fairly strong position in the U.S. today with their Mexinox operations and also imports coming in from Europe and other areas through Canada into the country. This whole facility, in our view, in Alabama is to streamline their operations and to bring stainless into their markets that they already have a large share of today. So they're starting up their first Mill. What they're doing is I've heard this point in time is that says that they're taking basically small orders. They're not trimming their orders, looking for confirmation of the quality out of this piece of equipment and they're basically in the cold rolling stage they're bringing in slab from Germany to roll here and they'll roll it on the new hot rolling facility's and they'll finish up in the cold rolling facilities. We think Piston is a competitor, think. They're a good company. They provide a good product and I don't think it changes much in the U.S. market except for the cost structure. The second question on Boeing, restocking. I don't know if there's a restocking issue but Boeing has certainly a growing issue so what we see is that these airplane programs are booked to the future. They're going to continue to ramp. We have a situation next year that the 787 for all practical purposes is going to ramp up throughout 2011. They're increasing their production in their single aisles going forward, in the 777 and 747-8, so whatever inventories that they going to be coming down. In our particular circumstances, we have agreements to supply that customer at certain levels. Those agreements call for take or pay volumes at certain levels in prices and so we will be producing at least of those volumes as we go-forward. I thank also good possibilities that as the rest of the titanium business as we see a begins to ramp on these new projects throughout the world that continuing supplies will start to see prices moving up, scrap prices or moving up now, I thank announced price increases on sponge, we see rising prices in our own domestic markets, which makes our investments in sponge look better to us every day so I think as this market ramps up, Boeing's going to be happy to have any excess inventory on hand as the market ramps up for the production levels that we see coming throughout the industry, not just the aerospace industry but throughout the world including the desalinization projects, chemical processing projects that on the books and being asked for in starting in 20112013. So we feel pretty good about the overall supply demand relationship regardless of Boeing."

It looks like our mill product shipments, including Uniti's conversion in 2010 are going to approach quantities in the high 30s so we're going to have $37 million, $38 million of production this year. That number is going to increase substantially as we look at production in 2011. We're talking volumes way up in double digits so we need sponge and we need the production out of Raleigh and we also have a fairly large amount of production coming outside the company, which we've always said that we're going to do because we do not have enough sponge on hand to handle our own fully loaded product lines. We still see titanium moving up into quantities over this next 11, 12 and 13, but we think we'll be shipping 60 million pounds of finished product, including our Uniti joint ventures. So you see where we are coming from on overall sponge capacity. We will continue to buy on the upside. So with the Raleigh facility, our goal is to get that plant up and running, rotating quality, making rotating quality sponge. In order to do that, we have to have a standardized process that is in control and capable of producing rotating quality each and every day of the week across all 36 sets of units there so where we are today. We're in production. We are still continuing to develop that process, where we feel we have that we have it in control and capable and locked in on making rotating quality parts. Until we have that process locked in, then the product that we're producing goes to lower grade products such as B quality or aircraft frame quality or industrial quality titanium. So there's 2 things that are happening, we're locking in the processes we need to produce the rotating quality. We're getting the equipment capable and under control and we're working on ways to make sure that we have the right yields and the right recoveries out of what we are doing so this is a process that we are continuing to improve and hopefully, early next year, we'll have what we want in place and we'll begin the qualification process for rotating quality."

I thank we are seeing nickel growing into the fourth quarter and we're going to see titanium kind of staying flat and up in the air frame side throughout the end of the year. A lot of this is determined by needs of customers into the first quarter. So answering your second part about the first quarter, we think that we're going to ramp fairly quickly into these higher quantities beginning early in the year fourth quarter earlier and in the year somewhere 37 million to 38 million pounds. So we've shipped 29 million so far including conversion work so it's just back and forth between forms whether it's rounds, whatever so it's mix and it's end markets. We're supplying a lot of metal outside the aerospace market these days. Oil and gas is chemical processing, its airframe, its aero engine. So all those factors are moving parts."

I think what we don't know, quite frankly, is where the customer behavior pattern will be and Pat articulated the uncertainty, I think, that exists in short-term or the average number of months inventory is on the stainless side. It's really pretty low customers so customers are reacting near-term to fairly longer lead times on the stainless side than they were maybe 9 months ago, but certainly still fairly short lead times so I think our view of the fourth quarter is the same ones that the customers are dealing with and we're going to have some cost that we incurred in the third quarter that won't be there in the fourth quarter. Pat articulated those and those are all in the earnings release and in terms of what the volume is going to be and end up being is going to be dependent upon what the customers what actions customers to in terms of the inventory management and what they need.

I will say that the first thing in a recovery of any product line or in our businesses is the return of volume. We have now seen in 2010 the return of volume to fairly good levels and we're are anticipating very good double-digit growth next year in the overall type titanium market. I also mentioned that there's now projects outside of Aerospace that will take very, very large volumes of sponge and melting and finished product in order to supply and they're coming from all over the world, mostly out of Asia and the Mid East. So these are big new projects that changed the dynamics of that industry. I think changing dynamic will be the price of scrap and as you look of the price of scrap, that will influence the overall price of what sponge will sell for on a spot basis. So when we have those 2 things, those 2 things in the past I think we can presumably lead to price increases, both in the surcharge in the demand and in the pricing of the products. We have seen them move rapidly in the past. So I'm not going to predict what the pricing could be, but I will reiterate anyone that has inventories of titanium will probably be glad they have them as they move into next year.

I think the other determination as to how much supply is at any particular customer and there's a key phrase that we have to work on we don't have any understanding than you do what the phrase goes like this. I have this much supply under current build rates. So I'm using so much today and if I add it all together that's how long it's going to take me to get down to the level I want. When I look at increasing build rates or a new program coming on or for example, let's just one customer like 175 new F-15s, I think it's F-15 or F-18. F-18s out of St. Louis that were unexpected, things like that, change your all these things have assumptions in them so what I'm giving you color that says titanium is getting momentum, scrap prices are up.

We did win that, that was a nice win for ATI. It's really one of the first initial forays, if you will, into supplying titanium products to the DLA. I thank the bigger opportunities exist more on the armor side. That's where we're working using ATI 425 alloy for fabrication allocation, applications that's the comment that Pat made in his prepared comments show here this week, we're also working on so I think the armor market is a relatively new market for ATI, one that we are focused on market sector team standpoint so I think initially, at least the applications will be high hard steel said ATI 425 and possibly 64 plate as well in armor applications, primarily plates but also the possibility of some of our testing products that come out of are why John operations."

I thank certainly the margins that we're making today in that segment or in what we expect to make in the 11, 12, 13 timeframe as we full spectrum of the capabilities we have both in nickel and titanium specialty alloys and exotic alloys but I think that the margin dollars, if you will, thank we said this before, we're not planning, for example, despite what we said earlier, we're not planning for titanium scrap to be $20 a pound again, like it was in '07. But you know what, it may be, but who knows? If it is, we pay that eventually but you have a timing element there, perhaps where you have a short-term advantage but I think as the margin gross and the earnings per share growth, there's going to be a combination of a richer product mix, new products, including powder, higher volumes and the benefits of all the cost reductions that we put into these businesses over the years and the new products we're talking about are not only the development of the powder business but also fastener stocks in all alloy systems, not just nickel but also titanium and the end market growth, all of which Pat has talked about earlier So I think that, we're not, as you saw from us the last time, we made some prognostications before the last ramp up of where we expect those segment margins to be and we blew through them so I think the one thing you can rest assured of is the margins will be as good as we can make them but the earnings will come from a variety of different sources."

Unless you change the -- completely change the product form, someplace along the supply chain, the same pounds are being made. For example, you have this new machining joint venture with VSMPO and Boeing. I'm assuming Boeing's buying from that joint venture and buying much more near net sizes but VSMPO still has to produce the same amount of product in order to get it into that form. The same amount of mental in the industry is being used even though Boeing may not be buying it in that form. The same thing with us as Boeing comes in and asks for near net sized shapes, we actually have improved margins on that product even though it may be less pounds that they're buying from us but when we look at the total amount of sponge that we cast, the total going into the melt, into the ingot to make that product, we're still making those units and using those capacities to produce a near net size that is closer for the customer to buy and then we charge more for that product but it takes the same utilization out of the industry. So it's a very complex thing to really understand. It isn't that the airplane in the total value chain will take less metal, it's the customer at the end is buying different products that he's buying less metal for more money. But the total value chain is still producing basically the same amount of product, so that's one way to look at it. I think in terms of pricing. Our price increases that we just recently announced and just recently announced on the base price and also, that's the transaction business and also on our surcharges are pretty well set for the fourth quarter and those kind of announcements are for product that's currently being booked into the first quarter of next year, not the fourth quarter of this year."

Our key global markets are performing well. We've seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year-to-date 2009. Sales for the first 9 m",2004,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone joining us for today's call. Our key global markets are performing well. We've seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year-to-date 2009. Sales for the first 9 months of 2010  are just $45 million below our sales for all of 2009. We continue to improve the efficiency of our operations. 
Cost reductions year-to-date are $102 million. We've exceeded our $100 million goal for cost reductions in 2010 and 9 months. We have a strong cash balance and strong balance sheet. Cash on hand increased to over $443 million. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 23% and total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. Our strategy has been to target certain market sectors that we believe are in the long-term secular growth trends that are greater than the average global GDP. We still see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in those key global markets. 
Order entry and optimism has improved from several markets. We recently announced price increases for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys, both in long products and flat-rolled products. 
In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, announced a price increase for CP titanium products. Because of extending lead times, these price increases are expected to impact 2011 performance beginning in the first quarter. As we previously announced, third quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by certain issues. First is the volatile and erratic price of LME traded nickel. We booked a significant LIFO catch-up charge in the third quarter. From April to July, the average LME nickel price dropped by 26%. From July to October, it rose 23%. So we had to change our assumptions and book the charge. We now expect a full year 2010 LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $54 million. So the third quarter, catch-up charge was an additional $33 million. Currently, we expect a $14 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. These LIFO charges mainly impact our flat-rolled product results.
In addition, the nickel price movement has been causing unusual buying patterns by some customers, particularly for our standard products. Shipments in September were surprisingly strong. Part of this is likely due to customer buying to beat the rising October surcharge. October buying is also strong as customers are trying to beat the November surcharge increase. While month-on-month shipments are choppy, we are seeing recovery. Overall demand for standard stainless products is keeping paced with the modest GDP growth of the U.S. and European economies.
Other issues that impacted the third quarter operating profit are the startup, idle facility and major maintenance charges. High-performance metals segment operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million of startup and idle facility costs associated with our titanium sponge operations. We expect these charges to be similar in the fourth quarter and by approximately $7 million related to a 2-week shutdown of our zirconium facilities to adjust inventory levels and perform major maintenance. We do not expect this charge to continue in the fourth quarter 2010. 
Flat-Rolled Products segment operating profit was negatively impacted by $5 million of higher than normal major maintenance expenses. We do not expect such a charge in the fourth quarter 2010. While these startup costs have been a headwind to 2010 operating profit, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. 
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania melt shop is complete. We reduced the footprint and expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions beginning in 2011. 
Our titanium and superalloy forge facility in Bakers, North Carolina continues to obtain customer qualifications and adds much needed forging and finishing capacity and capabilities. Timing on completion of this project looks good as demand is strengthening from our aerospace, oil and gas and electrical energy customers. 
The ramp-up at our Rowley, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. We are producing sponge and we are now working on standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect capital expenditures on our new hot rolling and processing facility to begin increasing in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we now expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $250 million.
Strength in our key markets is providing the foundation for resumption of strong secular growth beginning in 2011. We believe aerospace remains a long-term growth market for ATI. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced planned increases to their production schedules. Their backlogs are strong and they are being extended by new orders. Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft rates, such as for the 777, are also growing. The 787 has been delayed, but we expect demand from this next generation aircraft to pick up throughout 2011. 
For ATI, aero engine demand is being driven by all of the aircraft schedules. In addition, aero engine spare demand is being driven by a strong recovery in passenger and freight traffic and also the growing size of a global fleet.
Now turning to the oil and gas market. U.S. and international drill rig counts continue a steady climb, driving our order backlogs and pushing out lead times for certain products. ATI revenue from this market for the first 9 months of 2010 has grown by 65% compared to the same period in 2009. In addition, direct international sales accounted for 42% of our sales to the oil and gas market during the first 9 months of 2010. 
We expect this strong demand to continue. We're seeing opportunities to supply our products, particularly specialty plate, for several large global projects. Demand is strong in our High Performance Metals segment for our specialty steels used for non-magnetic drill collars and for our nickel-based alloys for completion tools. Demand has also improved for our tungsten drilling products. 
In the Chemical Process industry, we're seeing opportunities for several large seawater desalinization plants that could potentially, significantly drive demand for CP titanium. Titanium is being considered as a substitute for copper nickel alloys in these applications.
In the electrical energy market, demand of our grain-oriented electrical steel products remained relatively flat, but at 80% capacity levels for ATI. Demands from the nuclear electrical energy market for our zirconium products has remained flat, while activity has picked up for specialty alloy plate for spent nuclear fuel storage. Orders improved for nickel-based super alloys for gas turbines in the quarter.
The medical market reached nearly 6% of sales for the first 9 months of 2010. Biomedical sales have been steady at high levels during the year. Demand was strong for our niobium titanium alloys from the medical equipment market for MRI applications. These are all very good signs for ATI. 
ATI is innovating for the future. We're adding innovative new products to improve customer productivity and so that they can make their products better and faster. We have a robust pipeline of new products. 
In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for the use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. We expect this innovative new alloy to grow our share in the aero-engine market, particularly as the aircraft build schedules increase. 
Following the technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 titanium alloy sheet and plate this summer, the team has seen a rush of technical and material inquiries from the aerospace and defense markets, as well as other high end markets. Customer interest in this new product is strong. Our customers recognize the total cost solution this new alloy can provide. Customer testing in the early stages of qualification has gone well. Process qualification adoption of a new alloy in the aerospace business will take about 12 to 18 months. 
A prototype application constructed of our new alloys is on display this week at the Army USA Annual Meeting in Washington DC. If you plan to be there, go to the AM General Display and look for a sign that reads ATI and AM General Survivability Solutions. You'll see a blast bucket that is tested and proved and made with our new materials.
We recently added titanium fasteners stock to our list of diversified product offerings. ATI now provides titanium alloy as well as nickel and specialty alloy fastener stock to the aerospace and defense market. We expect demand from the fastener supply chain to be strong, when and as airframe production ramps up to meet the new build schedules. We also recently commercialized another new lean duplex stainless steel, ATI 2102 lean duplex stainless steel contains even less nickel and moly than our other lean duplex ATI 2003 alloy. This is a global leader with a broad range of super duplex, duplex and lean alloys. Demand for duplex stainless steel is growing as customers look for alternatives that reduce exposure to high and volatile raw material costs. ATI Ludlum is working on our new with our new ATI Powder business to develop a line of borated stainless steel is. Borated stainless requires a complex chemistry that is not easily melted, thus the use of powders. These alloys are used for the storage of spent nuclear fuel.
During the first 9 months of 2010, we've been navigating through some choppiness and uncertainty that often characterizes a recovery year. We see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets. Our new assets and innovative products are setting a solid foundation for growth. 
In my personal view, I feel more optimistic today about 2011, than I did at any other time during this year, in 2010. We are now seeing more evidence that a strong recovery is underway in our key markets. Volume is up. Asset utilization is increasing and pushing out lead times. We announced several price increases that we believe will permit us to increase the returns on our available capacity. ATI is growing our share in these markets with new products. We're being recognized by new customers as a strategic source due to all that we can now provide and our industry-leading quality and service. We're growing our share through our market sector teams. We're better positioned than ever in the aerospace, defense, oil and gas and nuclear energy markets. Because of market demand, we introduced titanium fastener stock and near-net shapes to the aerospace business. 
We invested in the machining center at our Sheffield U.K. facility and we're now providing fully machined drill collars and other products to the oil and gas market. Demand has been terrific for this product and lead times are pushed out well into 2011. These new assets are also capable of machining our products for the aerospace and defense industry. 
The actions we have taken allow us to improve our share and grow faster than the markets we have identified that have secular growth trends that are greater than the global average GDP. Frankly, we feel very good about 2011 and beyond. However, factors beyond our control really impact our short-term visibility. Because of so much uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. and the volatility of many raw material prices, we cannot predict the actions of our customers, particularly in the final weeks of this year. It's just uncertain. For example, will customers add inventory, maintain current inventory levels or reduce? Will their actions be impacted in the short-term by the uncertainty lame duck [ph] Congress, actions by the Federal Reserve, uncertain regulatory environment or other outside or internal factors of their business? The answer to that is, I just don't know. What I do have is a strong conviction that 2011 will be far better for ATI than 2010, that 2012 will be better than 2011 and that 2013 continues and will be far better than 2012. So we have a very optimistic view of the long-term prospects starting next year and beginning to go forward. 
I think that's enough comments for me and we'll open up the meeting up for any questions anyone might have."

Thyssen is just starting up those facilities. As you know, they have a fairly strong position in the U.S. today with their Mexinox operations and also imports coming in from Europe and other areas through Canada into the country. So this whole facility, in our view, in Alabama, is to streamline their operations and to bring stainless into their market that they already have a large share of today. So they're starting up their first mill. What they're doing as we've heard at this point in time is it's a test, they're taking basically small orders. They're not trimming the orders or looking for confirmation of the quality out of this piece of equipment and they're basically in the cold rolling stage. They're actually bringing in white coils out of Germany, so they're not even being hot rolled. Eventually they'll be bringing in slab from German to roll here and they'll roll it on their new hot rolling facilities and then they'll finish it in their cold rolling facilities. We think Thyssen is a good competitor. I think they're a good company. They provide a good product and I don't think it changes much in the U.S. market except for their cost structure. The second question on Boeing restocking. I don't know if there's a restocking issue but Boeing has certainly a growing issue. So what we see is that these airplane programs are booked to the future. They're going to continue to ramp. We have a situation next year that the 787, for all practical purposes, is going to ramp up throughout 2011. They're increasing their production in their single-aisles going forward, in the 777 and 747-8. So whatever inventories that they have on hand, those inventories are going to be coming down. In our particular circumstances, we have agreements to supply that customer at certain levels. Those agreements call for take or pay volumes at certain levels and prices and so we will be producing at least to those volumes as we go forward. I think there's also good possibilities that as the rest of the titanium business, as we see it, begins to ramp on these new projects throughout the world, that continuing supplies will start to see prices moving up, scrap prices or moving up now. I think one supplier just announced price increases for next year on sponge. We see rising scrap prices in our own domestic markets, which makes our investments in sponge look better to us every day. So I think as this market ramps up, Boeing is going to be happy. They have any excess inventory on hand as the market ramps up for the production levels that we see coming throughout the industry, not just the aerospace industry but throughout the world including the desalinization projects, chemical processing projects that we are now seeing coming on the books and being asked for and starting in 2011, '12 and '13. So we feel pretty good about the overall supply demand relationship regardless of Boeing."

It looks like our mill product shipments, including Uniti's conversion in 2010 are going to approach quantities in the high 30s. So we're going to have 37 million, 38 million pounds of final production shipped this year. That number is going to increase substantially as we look at production in 2011. We're talking volumes way up in double digits. So we need sponge and we need the production out of Rowley and we also have a fairly large amount of production coming in from outside the company, which we've always said that we're going to do because we do not have enough sponge on hand to handle our own fully loaded product lines. We still see titanium moving up into quantities over this next '11, '12 and '13, but we think we will be shipping 60 million pounds of finished product, including our Uniti joint ventures. So you see where we're coming from in overall sponge capacity. We will continue to buy on the outside. So with the Rowley facility, our goal is to get that plant up and running, rotating quality, making rotating quality sponge. In order to do that, we have to have a standardized process that is in control and capable of producing rotating quality each and every day of the week across all 36 sets of units there. So where we are today? We're in production. We are still continuing to develop that process, but we feel we have it in control and capable and locked in on making rotating quality parts. Until we have that process locked in, then the product that we're producing goes to lower grade products such as B quality, or aircraft frame quality, or industrial quality titanium. So there's 2 things that are happening, we're locking in the processes we need to produce the rotating quality. We're getting the equipment capable and under control and we're working on ways to make sure that we have the right yields and the right recoveries out of what we're doing so this is a process that we're continuing to improve and hopefully, early next year, we'll have what we want in place and we'll begin the qualification process for rotating quality."

A lot of this is determined by needs of customers into the first quarter. So answering your second part about the first quarter, we think that we're going to ramp fairly quickly next year into these higher quantities beginning early in the year and we've kind of looked at the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier, ending the year somewhere 37 million to 38 million pounds.

I think what we don't know, quite frankly, is where the customer behavior pattern will be and Pat articulated the uncertainty, I think, that exists in short-term, you see where the average number of months inventory is on the stainless side, it's really pretty low. So customers are reacting near-term to fairly longer lead times on the stainless side than they were maybe 9 months ago, but certainly still fairly short lead times. So I think our view of the fourth quarter is that the issues that we're dealing with are the same ones that the customers are dealing with and we're going to have some cost that we incurred in the third quarter that won't be there in the fourth quarter. Pat articulated those and those are all in the earnings release. And in terms of what the volume is going to be and end up being is really going to be dependent upon what the customers -- what actions the customers do in terms of their year-end inventory management and what they need.

I'm not going to talk about specific price actions that we're going to take. I will say this. I will say that the first thing in a recovery of any product line or in our businesses is the return of volume. We have now seen, in 2010, the return of volume to fairly good levels and we're anticipating very good double-digit growth next year in the overall titanium market. I also mentioned that there's now projects outside of aerospace that will take very, very large volumes of sponge and melting and finished product in order to supply and they're coming from all over the world, mostly out of Asia and the Mid East. So these are big new projects that changed the dynamics of that industry. I think a changing dynamic will be the price of scrap and as you look of the price of scrap, that will influence the overall price of what sponge will sell for on a spot basis. So when we have those 2 things, those 2 things in the past, I think, we can presumably lead to price increases, both in the surcharge, in the demand and in the pricing of the products. We have seen them move rapidly in the past, in very short periods of time. So I'm not going to predict what the pricing could be, but I will reiterate anyone that has inventories of titanium will probably be glad they have them as they move into next year. So we're bullish about the titanium market in its volume and in its ability to increase revenues, unit revenues."

Two, the industrial markets for titanium are growing very rapidly on a global basis, as I've mentioned several times here, so scrap is going to go into that kind of a market. Now in actual changes, we entered the year with bulk weldable solid scrap around $3.50 a pound. I think the latest buy we've made is $7 -- $7 for processed bulk weldable scrap. So the fact to the matter is, the market tells you it's in short supply. I don't care what anybody else says, when you've got $7 of bulk weldables, it's different than in January, like, twice as much. We know that business is increasing next year in the double-digit rates. So as this is going to get somewhat shorter, We [indiscernible] have locked in pads, so that the scrap that we generate through our total value chain, much of it will come back to us and not go to the open market. So we have all those factors sitting out there. I think the other determination as to how much supply is at any particular customer is if there's a key phrase in there that we have to work on and I don't have any understanding than you do but the phrase goes like this, I have this much supply under current build rates. So I'm using so much today and if I add it all together that's how long it's going to take me to get down to the level I want. When I look at increasing build rates or a new program coming on or for example, let's just one customer like 175 new F-15s, I think it's F-15 or F-18. F-18s out of St. Louis that were unexpected, those are all titanium bulkheads and things like that, does that change your time to move inventories? All these things have some assumptions in them. So our information and what I'm giving you is some color that says, I think that titanium is getting momentum, scrap prices are up. We know that production will be up and there's some big projects out there that will, as they come through, can really change the dynamics of the whole thing."

The operations, the consolidation in Brackenridge are complete. We're really thrilled with what we have there. In fact, we are seeing some of those savings today at the Brackenridge plant. The way we're operating the plant on the new hot mill complex is that it's a totally separate part of plant. It's fenced off. And the older part of the plant is operation independent of the new facilities. So that will have no interference or cost factors to the new side of the plant. As time goes forward on the superalloy forging facility, it's just a matter of getting more products qualified. So we could use the facility for every end product that we would like to use it for.

But I think that the margin dollars, if you will, I think we've said this before, we're not planning, for example, despite what we said earlier, we're not planning for titanium scrap to be $20 a pound again, like it was in '07. But you know what, it may be. Who knows? If it is, we pay that eventually but you have a timing element there, perhaps where you have a short-term advantage but I think that the margin growth and the earnings per share growth are going to be a combination of a richer product mix, new products, including powder, higher volumes and the benefits of all the cost reductions that we put into these businesses over the years and the new products we're talking about are not only the development of the Powder business but also fastener stocks in all alloy systems, not just nickel but also titanium.

Unless you change the -- completely change the product form, someplace along the supply chain, the same pounds are being made. For example, you have this new machining joint venture with VSMPO and Boeing. I'm assuming Boeing's buying from that joint venture and buying much more near-net sizes, but VSMPO still has to produce the same amount of product in order to get it into that form. The same amount of metal in the industry is being used even though Boeing may not be buying it in that form. The same thing with us as Boeing comes in and asks for near-net sized shapes, we actually have improved margins on that product even though it may be less pounds that they're buying from us but when we look at the total amount of sponge that we cast, the total going into the melt, into the ingot to make that product, we're still making those units and using those capacities to produce a near-net size that is closer for the customer to buy and then we charge more for that product, but it takes the same utilization out of the industry. So it's a very complex thing to really understand. It isn't that the airplane in the total value chain will take less metal, it's the customer at the end is buying different products that he's buying less metal for more money. But the total value chain is still producing basically the same amount of product, so that's one way to look at it. I think in terms of pricing. Our price increases that we just recently announced and we just recently announced on the base price and also, that's the transaction business and also on our surcharges are pretty well set for the fourth quarter and those kind of announcements are for product that's currently being booked into the first quarter of next year, not the fourth quarter of this year."

Basically, the chemistry looks -- is coming in line. It looks pretty good. We're making progress on that week-on-week, run-on-run. We have a curing issue on these vessels where the first run has some curing to do to it with a brand-new vessel coming into production versus a vessel that's under it's second or third run. And then training of people and peer process development. So I think it's a normal progression. We are making product. We are getting sponge out of the facility.

I mean they're right there at rotating quality and now you really just have to go through the process of locking in the manufacturing process, getting -- once you produce that sponge cake, you've got to crush it, you've got to inspect it, you've got to get it into heat and melt it all the way through and get the chemistries of the ingot et cetera, et cetera and it's a fairly long, actually, manufacturing process. It's not just loading the tickle onto the molten mag into the retort and then after the 7 or 8 or 9-day period, you know what you've got. You've got to take it all the way through melt and it's a time-consuming process.

And thanks to everyone joining us for today's call. Our key global markets are performing well. We've seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year-to-date 2009. Sales for the first 9 m",2004,"Thanks, Dan. And thanks to everyone joining us for today's call. Our key global markets are performing well. We've seen strong year-on-year recovery as sales increased 52% in the third quarter or 39% for the full year-to-date 2009. Sales for the first 9 months of 2010  are just $45 million below our sales for all of 2009. We continue to improve the efficiency of our operations. 
Cost reductions year-to-date are $102 million. We've exceeded our $100 million goal for cost reductions in 2010 in 9 months. We have a strong cash balance and a strong balance sheet. Cash on hand increased to over $443 million. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 23% and total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. Our strategy has been to target certain market sectors that we believe are in the long-term secular growth trends that are greater than the average global GDP. We still see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in those key global markets. 
Order entry and optimism has improved from several markets. We recently announced price increases for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys, both in long products and flat-rolled products. 
In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, announced a price increase for CP titanium products. Because of extending lead times, these price increases are expected to impact 2011 performance beginning in the first quarter. As we previously announced, third quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by certain issues. First is the volatile and erratic price of LME traded nickel. We booked a significant LIFO catch-up charge in the third quarter. From April to July, the average LME nickel price dropped by 26%. From July to October, it rose 23%. So we had to change our assumptions and book the charge. We now expect a full year 2010 LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $54 million. So the third quarter, catch-up charge was an additional $33 million. Currently, we expect a $14 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. These LIFO charges mainly impact our flat-rolled product results.
In addition, the nickel price movement has been causing unusual buying patterns by some customers, particularly for our standard stainless products. Shipments in September were surprisingly strong. Part of this is likely due to customer buying to beat the rising October surcharge. October buying is also strong as customers are trying to beat the November surcharge increase. While month-on-month shipments are choppy, we are seeing recovery. Overall demand for standard stainless products is keeping paced with the modest GDP growth of the U.S. and European economies.
Other issues that impacted the third quarter operating profit are the startup, idle facility and major maintenance charges. High-performance metals segment operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million of startup and idle facility costs associated with our titanium sponge operations. We expect these charges to be similar in the fourth quarter. And by approximately $7 million related to a 2-week shutdown of our zirconium facilities to adjust inventory levels and perform major maintenance. We do not expect this charge to continue in the fourth quarter 2010. 
Flat-Rolled Products segment operating profit was negatively impacted by $5 million of higher than normal major maintenance expenses. We do not expect such a charge in the fourth quarter 2010. While these startup costs have been a headwind to 2010 operating profit, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. 
The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania melt shop is complete. We reduced the footprint and expect to benefit by up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions beginning in 2011. 
Our titanium and superalloy forge facility in Bakers, North Carolina, continues to obtain customer qualifications and adds much needed forging and finishing capacity and capabilities. Timing on completion of this project looks good as demand is strengthening from our aerospace, oil and gas and electrical energy customers. 
The ramp-up at our Rowley, Utah, premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. We are producing sponge and we are now working on standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect capital expenditures on our new hot rolling and processing facility to begin increasing in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we now expect 2010 capital investments to be approximately $250 million.
Strength in our key markets is providing the foundation for resumption of strong secular growth beginning in 2011. We believe aerospace remains a long-term growth market for ATI. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced planned increases to their production schedules. Their backlogs are strong and they are being extended by new orders. Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft rates, such as for the 777, are also growing. The 787 has been delayed, but we expect demand from this next generation aircraft to pick up throughout 2011. 
For ATI, aero engine demand is being driven by all of the aircraft schedules. In addition, aero engine spare demand is being driven by a strong recovery in passenger and freight traffic and also the growing size of a global fleet.
Now turning to the oil and gas market. U.S. and international drill rig counts continue a steady climb, driving our order backlogs and pushing out lead times for certain products. ATI revenue from this market for the first 9 months of 2010 has grown by 65% compared to the same period in 2009. In addition, direct international sales accounted for 42% of our sales to the oil and gas market during the first 9 months of 2010. 
We expect this strong demand to continue. We're seeing opportunities to supply our products, particularly specialty plate, for several large global projects. Demand is strong in our High Performance Metals segment for our specialty steels used for non-magnetic drill collars and for our nickel-based alloys for completion tools. Demand has also improved for our tungsten drilling products. 
In the Chemical Process industry, we're seeing opportunities for several large seawater desalinization plants that could potentially, significantly drive demand for CP titanium. Titanium is being considered as a substitute for copper nickel alloys in these applications.
In the electrical energy market, demand of our grain-oriented electrical steel products remained relatively flat, but at 80% capacity levels for ATI. Demands from the nuclear electrical energy market for our zirconium products has remained flat, while activity has picked up for specialty alloy plate for spent nuclear fuel storage. Orders improved for nickel-based super alloys for gas turbines in the quarter.
The medical market reached nearly 6% of sales for the first 9 months of 2010. Biomedical sales have been steady at high levels during the year. Demand was strong for our niobium titanium alloys from the medical equipment market for MRI applications. These are all very good signs for ATI. 
ATI is innovating for the future. We're adding innovative new products to improve customer productivity and so that they can make their products better and faster. We have a robust pipeline of new products. 
In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for the use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. We expect this innovative new alloy to grow our share in the aero-engine market, particularly as the aircraft build schedules increase. 
Following the technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 titanium alloy sheet and plate this summer, the team has seen a rush of technical and material inquiries from the aerospace and defense markets, as well as other high end markets. Customer interest in this new product is strong. Our customers recognize the total cost solution this new alloy can provide. Customer testing in the early stages of qualification has gone well. Process qualification adoption of a new alloy in the aerospace business will take about 12 to 18 months. 
A prototype application constructed of our new alloys is on display this week at the Army USA Annual Meeting in Washington DC. If you plan to be there, go to the AM General Display and look for a sign that reads ATI and AM General Survivability Solutions. You'll see a blast bucket that is tested and proved and made with our new materials.
We recently added titanium fasteners stock to our list of diversified product offerings. ATI now provides titanium alloy as well as nickel and specialty alloy fastener stock to the aerospace and defense market. We expect demand from the fastener supply chain to be strong, when and as airframe production ramps up to meet the new build schedules. 
We also recently commercialized another new lean duplex stainless steel, ATI 2102 lean duplex stainless steel contains even less nickel and moly than our other lean duplex ATI 2003 alloy. This is a global leader with a broad range of super duplex, duplex and lean alloys. Demand for duplex stainless steel is growing as customers look for alternatives that reduce exposure to high and volatile raw material costs. 
ATI Ludlum is working on our new with our new ATI Powder business to develop a line of borated stainless steels. Borated stainless requires a complex chemistry that is not easily melted, thus the use of powders. These alloys are used for the storage of spent nuclear fuel.
During the first 9 months of 2010, we've been navigating through some choppiness and uncertainty that often characterizes a recovery year. We see 2010 as a transition year to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets. Our new assets and innovative products are setting a solid foundation for growth. 
In my personal view, I feel more optimistic today about 2011 than I did at any other time during this year, in 2010. We are now seeing more evidence that a strong recovery is underway in our key markets. Volume is up. Asset utilization is increasing and pushing out lead times. We announced several price increases that we believe will permit us to increase the returns on our available capacity. ATI is growing our share in these markets with new products. 
We're being recognized by new customers as a strategic source due to all that we can now provide and our industry-leading quality and service. We're growing our share through our market sector teams. We're better positioned than ever in the aerospace, defense, oil and gas and nuclear energy markets. Because of market demand, we introduced titanium fastener stock and near-net shapes to the aerospace business. 
We invested in the machining center at our Sheffield U.K. facility and we're now providing fully machined drill collars and other products to the oil and gas market. Demand has been terrific for this product and lead times are pushed out well into 2011. These new assets are also capable of machining our products for the aerospace and defense industry. 
The actions we have taken allow us to improve our share and grow faster than the markets we have identified that have secular growth trends that are greater than the global average GDP. Frankly, we feel very good about 2011 and beyond. However, factors beyond our control really impact our short-term visibility. Because of so much uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. and the volatility of many raw material prices, we cannot predict the actions of our customers, particularly in the final weeks of this year. It's just uncertain. 
For example, will customers add inventory, maintain current inventory levels or reduce? Will their actions be impacted in the short-term by the uncertainty lame duck congress, actions by the Federal Reserve, uncertain regulatory environment or other outside or internal factors of their business? The answer to that is, I just don't know. 
What I do have is a strong conviction that 2011 will be far better for ATI than 2010, that 2012 will be better than 2011, and that 2013 continues and will be far better than 2012. So we have a very optimistic view of the long-term prospects starting next year and beginning to go forward. 
I think that's enough comments for me, and we'll open up the meeting now for any questions anyone might have."

Thyssen is just starting up those facilities. As you know, they have a fairly strong position in the U.S. today with their Mexinox operations and also imports coming in from Europe and other areas through Canada into the country. So this whole facility, in our view, in Alabama, is to streamline their operations and to bring stainless into their market that they already have a large share of today. So they're starting up their first mill. What they're doing as we've heard at this point in time, is it's a test, they're taking basically small orders. They're not trimming the orders or looking for confirmation of the quality out of this piece of equipment. And they're basically in the cold rolling stage. They're actually bringing in white coils out of Germany, so they're not even being hot rolled. Eventually they'll be bringing in slab from German to roll here and they'll roll it on their new hot rolling facilities and then they'll finish it in their cold rolling facilities. We think Thyssen is a good competitor. I think they're a good company. They provide a good product, and I don't think it changes much in the U.S. market except for their cost structure. The second question on Boeing restocking. I don't know if there's a restocking issue but Boeing has certainly a growing issue. So what we see is that these airplane programs are booked to the future. They're going to continue to ramp. We have a situation next year that the 787, for all practical purposes, is going to ramp up throughout 2011. They're increasing their production in their single-aisles going forward, in the 777 and 747-8. So whatever inventories that they have on hand, those inventories are going to be coming down. In our particular circumstances, we have agreements to supply that customer at certain levels. Those agreements call for take or pay volumes at certain levels and prices, and so we will be producing at least to those volumes as we go forward. I think there's also good possibilities that as the rest of the titanium business, as we see it, begins to ramp on these new projects throughout the world, that continuing supplies will start to see prices moving up, scrap prices are moving up now. I think one supplier just announced price increases for next year on sponge. We see rising scrap prices in our own domestic markets, which makes our investments in sponge look better to us every day. So I think as this market ramps up, Boeing is going to be happy they have any excess inventory on hand as the market ramps up for the production levels that we see coming throughout the industry, not just the aerospace industry but throughout the world, including the desalinization projects, chemical processing projects that we are now seeing coming on the books and being asked for and starting in 2011, '12 and '13. So we feel pretty good about the overall supply demand relationship regardless of Boeing."

Can you give us an update as far as the progress in getting the products that are certified for rotor quality products? And then secondly, just the overall sponge sourcing strategy for 2011, if I remember correctly, I think you have some third-party contract that's rolling off. And just curious to see if you're going to be trying to supply more internally through Rowley or if you extended that contract or what's going on there?"

It looks like our mill product shipments, including Uniti's conversion in 2010 are going to approach quantities in the high 30s. So we're going to have 37 million, 38 million pounds of final production shipped this yea",376,"Well, let me just start it this way. It looks like our mill product shipments, including Uniti's conversion in 2010 are going to approach quantities in the high 30s. So we're going to have 37 million, 38 million pounds of final production shipped this year. That number is going to increase substantially as we look at production in 2011. We're talking volumes way up in double digits. So we need sponge and we need the production out of Rowley, and we also have a fairly large amount of production coming in from outside the company, which we've always said that we're going to do because we do not have enough sponge on hand to handle our own fully loaded product lines. We still see titanium moving up into quantities over this next '11, '12 and '13, but we think we will be shipping 60 million pounds of finished product, including our Uniti joint ventures. So you see where we're coming from in overall sponge capacity. We will continue to buy on the outside. So with the Rowley facility, our goal is to get that plant up and running, rotating quality, making rotating quality sponge. In order to do that, we have to have a standardized process that is in control and capable of producing rotating quality each and every day of the week across all 36 sets of units there. So where we are today? We're in production. We are still continuing to develop that process, but we feel that we have it in control and capable and locked in on making rotating quality parts. Until we have that process locked in, then the product that we're producing goes to lower grade products, such as B quality, or aircraft frame quality, or industrial quality titanium. So there's 2 things that are happening, we're locking in the processes we need to produce the rotating quality. We're getting the equipment capable and under control. And we're working on ways to make sure that we have the right yields and the right recoveries out of what we're doing. So this is a process that we're continuing to improve, and hopefully early next year we'll have what we want in place and we'll begin the qualification process for rotating quality."

I think we are seeing nickel growing into the fourth quarter and we're going to see titanium kind of staying flat and up in the aero engine side down in airframe side throughout the end of the year. A lot of this is determined by needs of customers into the first quarter. So answering your second part about the first quarter. We think that we're going to ramp fairly quickly next year into these higher quantities beginning early in the year. And we've kind of looked at the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier, ending the year somewhere 37 million to 38 million pounds. So we've shipped 29 million, so far, including conversion work. It shifts back and forth between forms, whether it's going to be sheet, plate, rounds, whatever. So it's mix and it's end markets. We're supplying a lot of metal outside the aerospace market these days. So oil and gas, it's chemical processing, it's airframe, it's aero engine. So all those factors are moving parts."

The things that you just mentioned, we know that where the surcharge will be in November. We know what the trend is in terms of nickel, remember nickel isn't the only element of the surcharge but we know what that's doing and is likely to do in December or have a reasonable idea. I think what we don't know, quite frankly, is where the customer behavior pattern will be. And Pat articulated the uncertainty, I think, that exists in short-term. You see where the average number of months inventory is on the stainless side, it's really pretty low. So customers are reacting near-term to fairly longer lead times on the stainless side than they were maybe 9 months ago, but certainly still fairly short lead times. So I think our view of the fourth quarter is that the issues that we're dealing with are the same ones that the customers are dealing with. And we're going to have some cost that we incurred in the third quarter that won't be there in the fourth quarter. Pat articulated those and those are all in the earnings release. And in terms of what the volume is going to be, end up being, is really going to be dependent upon what the customers, what actions the customers do in terms of their year-end inventory management and what they need. So I think the fourth quarter is going to be the best we can make it.

I will say that the first thing in a recovery of any product line or in our businesses is the return of volume. We have now seen, in 2010, the return of volume to fairly good levels and we're anticipating very good double-digit growth next year in the overall titanium market. I also mentioned that there's now projects outside of aerospace that will take very, very large volumes of sponge and melting and finished product in order to supply. And they're coming from all over the world, mostly out of Asia and the Mid East. So these are big new projects that change the dynamics of that industry. I think a changing dynamic will be the price of scrap. And as you look of the price of scrap, that will influence the overall price of what sponge will sell for on a spot basis. So when we have those 2 things, those 2 things in the past, I think, we can presume lead to price increases, both in the surcharge, in the demand and in the pricing of the product. We have seen them move rapidly in the past, in very short periods of time. So I'm not going to predict what the pricing could be, but I will reiterate anyone that has inventories of titanium will probably be glad they have them as they move into next year.

Two, the industrial markets for titanium are growing very rapidly on a global basis, as I've mentioned several times here, so scrap is going to go into that kind of a market. Now in actual changes, we entered the year with bulk weldable solid scrap around $3.50 a pound. I think the latest buy we've made is $7, $7 for processed bulk weldable scrap. So the fact to the matter is, the market tells you it's in short supply. I don't care what anybody else says, when you've got $7 of bulk weldables, it's different than in January, like twice as much. We know that business is increasing next year in the double-digit rates. So it's just going to get somewhat shorter. We in our own revert paths have locked in pads so that the scrap that we generate through our total value chain, much of it will come back to us and not go to the open market. So we have all those factors sitting out there. I think the other determination as to how much supply is at any particular customer, is there's a key phrase in there that we have to work on. And I don't have any better understanding than you do but the phrase goes like this, I have this much supply under current build rates. So I'm using so much today and if I add it all together that's how long it's going to take me to get down to the level I want. When I look at increasing build rates or a new program coming on, or for example let's just use one customer like the 175 new F-15s -- I think it's F-15 or F-18 -- F-18s out of St. Louis that were unexpected, those are all titanium bulkheads and things like that, does that change your time to move inventories? All these things have some assumptions in them. So our information and what I'm giving you is some color that says, I think that titanium is getting momentum, scrap prices are up. We know that production will be up. And there's some big projects out there that will, as they come through, can really change the dynamics of the whole thing."

But I think we'll have the process where we want it to be, let's say, somewhere around the end of the first quarter next year. So that will go away. The operations, the consolidation in Brackenridge are complete. We're really thrilled with what we have there. In fact, we are seeing some of those savings today at the Brackenridge plant. The way we're operating the plant on the new hot mill complex is that it's a totally separate part of plant. It's fenced off. And the older part of the plant is operating independent of the new facilities. So that will have no interference or cost factors to the new side of the plant. As time goes forward on the superalloy forging facility, it's just a matter of getting more products qualified. So we could use the facility for every end product that we would like to use it for. I think the cost of startup over there is just a question of qualification."

That's where we're working using ATI 425 alloy for fabrication applications, that's the comment that Pat made in his prepared comments, at the AUSA show here this week. We're also working on some high hard steels for armor application. So I think the armor market is a relatively new market for ATI, it's one that we are focused on from a market sector team standpoint. I think initially at least, the applications will be high hard steels and ATI 425, and possibly 6-4 plate as well. In armor applications, primarily plate, but also the possibility of some of our casting product that comes out of our Wah Chang operations in high performance metals."

Is that, I mean, can we assume that at some point in the future you may go back to the margins we saw in '05 , '06 and '07, '06, '07 and '08, of sort of 30% type of numbers.

I mean, I think certainly the margins that we're making today in that segment aren't what we expect to make in the '11, '12, '13 timeframe, as we look at the full spectrum of the capabilities we have both in nickel and titanium and specialty alloys and exotic alloys. But I think that the margin dollars, if you will, I think we've said this before, we're not planning, for example, despite what we said earlier, we're not planning for titanium scrap to be $20 a pound again, like it was in '07. But you know what, it may be. Who knows? If it is, we pay that eventually but you have a timing element there, perhaps, where you have a short-term advantage. But I think that the margin growth and the earnings per share growth are going to be a combination of a richer product mix, new products, including powder, higher volumes, and the benefits of all the cost reductions that we put into these businesses over the years. And the new products we're talking about are not only the development of the Powder business but also fastener stocks in all alloy systems, not just nickel but also titanium. And the end market growth, all of which Pat has talked about earlier. So I think, we're not -- as you saw from us the last time, I think we made some prognostications before the last ramp up of where we would expect those segment margins to be and we blew through them. So I think the one thing you can rest assured of, that the margins will be as good as we can make them but the earnings will come from a variety of different sources."

The interesting part about getting to near-net size is unless you change the -- completely change the product form, someplace along the supply chain, the same pounds are being made. For example, you have this new machining joint venture with VSMPO and Boeing. I'm assuming Boeing's buying from that joint venture and buying much more near-net sizes, but VSMPO still has to produce the same amount of product in order to get it into that form. The same amount of metal in the industry is being used even though Boeing may not be buying it in that form. The same thing with us as Boeing comes in and asks for near-net sized shapes, we actually have improved margins on that product even though it may be less pounds that they're buying from us, but when we look at the total amount of sponge that we cast, the total going into the melt, into the ingot to make that product, we're still making those units and using those capacities to produce a near-net size that is closer for the customer to buy and then we charge more for that product, but it takes the same utilization out of the industry. So it's a very complex thing to really understand. It isn't that the airplane in the total value chain will take less metal, it's the customer at the end is buying different products that he's buying less metal for more money. But the total value chain is still producing, basically, the same amount of product. So that's one way to look at it. I think in terms of pricing. Our price increases that we just recently announced and just recently announced on the base price, and also that's the transaction business, and also on our surcharges are pretty well set for the fourth quarter. And those kind of announcements are for product that's currently being booked into the first quarter of next year, not the fourth quarter of this year."
