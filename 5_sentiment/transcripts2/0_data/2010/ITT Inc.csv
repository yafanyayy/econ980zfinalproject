And today extend for the hundreds of ITT employees who gladly joined us for this call, I want to personally thank you all of you and your teams for an exceptional performance and contribution in 2009. This was a year that our leadership and our 40,000 team members were challenged with volatile uncertainty, a year where swift decisions were required in the absence of clarity [ph], in the year where our customers were equally challenged and were not able to predict even what their needs were. Given this situation, ITT employees chose to win. We steadfastly advanced our strategy to continue to invest in our customer's vital growth areas and to invest in our own contribution to make the world better in safety, security, in vitality and in corporate citizenship. This unwavering commitment to our future goes not without a price.  There was a price we're willing to pay to enable ITT to now take advantage of our current opportunities. Winning in this new economy meant that we have not only be steady with our strategy investments, but to ensure that our future viability was sound with exceptional execution in overdriving cost reductions, essentially establishing new break even point for the company and by preserving our liquidity and protecting our balance sheet.This wasn't easy. 2009 was strategic [ph] for many of us. But we're now very energized because we did it all, exceeding our own expectations. What was most remarkable to me was that after all of our employees' hard work, we achieved our highest levels of employee's engagement scores ever, with marked increases in the midst of our most challenging task. Not only did we finish with best in class business results, ITT was broadly recognized externally for our corporate responsibility with many accolades: We are rated number 30 among the world's best companies by Newsweek's Green Ranking; we remained in the top 100 best corporate citizen by Corporate Responsibility Magazine; we are listed among the top 50 for employee diversity in engineering and IT professionals; we remained the top 10 military employer; and again, on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index; honored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations for our sustainability work in China; and then finally, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Corporate Stewardship Awards.So while this was our second best year ever in terms of business results, I believe it was our finest performance as a team. So I think it's worth capturing and recognizing some of our employees' terrific efforts in 2009, all of which was built on our strategic foundation and our esprit de corps as a company.In 2009, we focused on managing our supply chain, ensuring our cost inputs were synchronized with reductions in volume, and we drove cycle-time reductions to ensure that volatile changes in the flow of goods were matched with the appropriate levels of working capital. We performed extremely well operationally. And on top of that, we increased customer satisfaction in 40 engagements, as I mentioned, and we accelerated our long-term strategy.On customers. We aligned with customer's need, invested in new technologies, and we consolidated Motion & Flow Control value centers around some customer solutions. The proof of these advances were evident in our impressive list of significant contract wins in 2009. These included: The CREW 3.3 jamming program; the Japanese weather satellite; an Indian irrigation project; as well as a very large Brazilian oil and gas project; a new program on one of the world's largest desalination plants in Saudi; Ford Taurus, Escape and Focus component; and global railway in India and China.On cost. We repositioned our cost structure. We exceeded our original restructuring plan by investing in and executing a total of $178 million of restructuring actions since the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a very significant 10% reduction in our Commercial business workforce. We reduced our overall manufacturing footprint by 1 million square feet. We consolidated 10 locations, and we grew our low-cost region in manufacturing and sourcing presence by over 25% year-over-year. All of these decisions were difficult because of the impact on our employees. But they're also the right moves to position our company for the long term. We also implemented merit freezes and incentive pay reductions for all executives, while significantly reducing discretionary spending. On capital. We set a new free cash flow record of $1 billion in 2009. We've paid down $640 million of debt, and we termed down $1 billion of commercial paper. We acquired an energy-efficient circulator manufacturing with the Laing acquisition, which has greatly exceeded our expectations. During 2009, we dramatically improved our financial capacity, and despite our purposeful pause on acquisitions during 2009, today we have a robust pipeline of opportunities. On operations. We delivered over $500 million in gross productivity. The structural changes made to optimize our sourcing and these succeeding initiatives will provide lasting benefits. We also streamlined the oversight of our Fluid and Motion segments, and we plan for similar activity within the defense strategic realignment, which we are executing now.True leadership emerges from two challenges, and our 2009 execution further underscores how strong our leaders are in ITT. We did not sit back and wait for the downturn to end. We proactively attacked it with courage and focus. And as a result, we did end here a challenging 2009 as a much stronger company. So the progress we've made in advancing our strategy really positioned us for continued strong growth in the future.Turning to Slide 4. With the 2009, we ended our backs. Let's take a look at 2010's strategic priorities: Strategic execution, differentiated organic growth and portfolio alignment. We're confident that we will continue to leverage the ITT management system to deliver strong sales growth, improve productivity and solid free cash flow. Our recent investment in operations to excellence, growth initiatives and defense transformation will accelerate our progress.So given the strength of our business, my primary focus in 2010 will be our portfolio actions around the growing macro trends such as aging infrastructure, growing middle class, water needs and global security. We will pursue fluid adjacencies, emerging market opportunities, air traffic control and cyber security. We have the financial capacity to further this alignment, and we have the leadership teams that know how to invest, integrate and deliver.On Slide 5. Our Defense segment has been positioned to support our customer's emerging technology needs, while also growing and enhancing our ability to stake out new markets. We believe that this change will also allow ITT to achieve greater operating efficiencies and optimize our cost structure. Here's what the new segment, named ITT Defense and Information Solutions, looks like. Our Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and a portion of our Intelligence & Information Warfare units will combine to a $2.6 billion Electronic Systems division. This division will deliver advanced protection measures to help ITT customers defend their networks and disable enemy networks. Improved leveraging of technology will significantly advance our position in two programs like the JTRS, airborne-endowed [ph] electronic warfare and CREW 3.3 development, where the jamming, networking and communicating technologies are all integrated program elements.Our Space Systems and Night Vision units will combine to form Geospatial Systems. This new $1.2 billion value center will focus on next-generation energy that integrates space, airborne, ground and soldiers sensors into broader, coordinated systems. This combination will improve our competitiveness in the areas of digitally-enhanced night vision goggles, unmanned aerial vehicles and integrated intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions.Our Advanced Engineering & Sciences and our systems units were combined with part of Intelligent & Information Warfare to form Information Systems. This new $2.5 billion value center focus will be our network decision solution by combining large systems operations with the sophisticated techniques in information integration and protection. With powerful combination, we'll advance opportunities in the FAA's Next Generation air traffic management solutions, NASA programs and national intelligence networks as well as cyber security. We are very, very pleased with this initiative to substantially reposition our definitive Information Solutions business for the future. And now, Denise will review the business."

So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, c",1375,"Thanks, Steve. So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, compared to the prior year. The enduring nature of the demand for our products and our strong execution helped generate these solid results even in difficult market conditions. Our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of $0.97 was 18% higher than the prior year due to the benefits from our productivity initiatives, prior restructuring actions and lower restructuring and realignment cost that more than offset lower volumes and cost increases. For the full year, our adjusted EPS of $3.78 was down only 6%. And let me make an observation here. If you adjust for what I'll call non-operating items, both favorable and unfavorable, items such as FX, pension, restructuring and acquisitions, our 2009 operating EPS is down only 2% to 2008. Not many peers were able to deliver that kind of performance in 2009. Compared to the increased guidance mid-point that we just provided you on the guidance call on December 18, our adjusted 2009 EPS was $0.05 stronger. And that was due to slightly improved operating performances and lower non-operating expenses, partially offset by increased restructuring actions. Organic orders improved 3% compared to the prior year, and that was on strength in many of our key end markets, while difficult compared remains in industrial, commercial and aerospace. Sequential order growth of 25% reflected strength of Defense and positive performances at both Fluid and Motion. We are confident in our 2010 revenue forecasts, and our recent order trends and quoting activity is starting to pick up in some of the longer-cycle businesses. So not only did we deliver our best-in-class EPS performance in 2009, but we also greatly improved our financial position. Turn to Slide 7. In 2009, we generated a record $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding the after-tax impact of a $100 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the fourth quarter. This free cash flow performance was 22% better than the prior year, and it reflected a 146% conversion of continuing net income adjusted for non-cash special items. Our working capital, as a percent of sales, improved 70 basis points to 12.4%. And our net-debt-to-net-capital ratio declined from 27.9% at the beginning of the year to just 7% at the end of 2009. In addition, we have nearly exited the short-term commercial paper market, and we do have over $1.2 billion in cash. Now let's turn to Fluid Technology's fourth quarter results that's on Slide 8. Fluid delivered a solid Q4 that was actually better than our internal expectations due to improved top-line performances. The 13% organic revenue decline reflected continued strength in municipal markets that was offset by anticipated declines in industrial and commercial markets. Productivity gained momentum all year at Fluid and has repeatedly helped to mitigate lower volume and cost increases.Organic orders in the quarter were down 2%, but they were ahead of expectations. Front order activity was seen in the municipal treatment in transport, mining and oil and gas markets. The strength was more than offset by weaker global commercial and North American industrial orders. Sequential orders were slightly positive, and leading indicators on industrial activities have turned more favorable recently. For example, sequential organic orders at industrial process decreased 6%, and the book-to-bill rate in the quarter was 1.03. Also in the quarter, Fluid won a significant $20 million oil and gas contract in Brazil and a $7 million desalination project in Saudi Arabia. So with this latest win in Saudi Arabia, ITT now has products in three of the five largest desalinating facilities in the world. A view of the Motion Flow controls, our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. Motion revenue was down only 1% organically due to aerospace and general industrial weakness that was nearly offset by strong results in the automotive, rail, beverage and marine markets. In all of these segments, our competitive advantages drove market share gains during the downturn. And let's keep in mind that these share gains will be produced on our much more efficient manufacturing platform going forward.Operating margins improved 610 basis points in total and 230 basis points operationally compared to the prior year. This performance does reflect both the lower restructuring cost in the quarter and the aggregate benefit of two years of restructuring and realignment going back to 2008 but now total $84 million.Organic orders improved 7% with big gains at flow control and motion technology. We are taking share in food and beverage markets. We are winning significant global platforms in auto and rail. And we are seeing some general signs of stability in the connectors and general industrial markets. We do expect that aerospace will remain under pressure, but on the whole, Motion & Flow Control has clearly emerged from this past downturn as a leaner, more competitively-focused collection of growing businesses.Let's turn to Defense on Slide 10. The slight organic revenue decline in the quarter was consistent with our latest expectations. Service growth was strong with increased activity on a number of different contracts, including Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA Next Generation air traffic control program, ADS-B. International Night Vision grew significantly in the fourth quarter, and we expect continued strength into 2010. Increases in airborne electronic warfare were partially offset -- our lower ground electronic warfare, and SINCGARS volumes were down versus a strong prior year. Organic order growth of 5% brought our year-end defense backlog to $5.2 billion, generally flat the prior-year levels with little change in the mix of products and services. New order growth reflected anticipated replenishments of service contract fundings and a significant Japanese weather satellite order that more than offset lower ground electronic warfare orders.Productivity continued to be strong with 120 basis points of operational improvement in the quarter. So this strong performance pushed the full year defense margins up to a record 12.3%. Our recently announced Defense strategic realignment, coupled with the continuation of our productivity actions, will nicely benefit long-term Defense segment margins.Now let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about the 2010 guidance. So our strong Q4 performance has set us up very nicely on moving into 2010. Further stabilization in key end markets plus expanded productivity actions and increased confidence in our execution of these actions have contributed to our decision to increase our 2010 EPS guidance by $0.05 to $3.90 to $4.10. Now let me point out that our new 2010 EPS range is already back in line with our pre-economic downturn 2008 adjusted EPS, a remarkable accomplishment in a relatively short period of time. Sentimentally, our revenue guidance remained unchanged from the December outlook call. We are still projecting organic growth revenue growth in the 2% range, but future indicators have improved since December, increasing our overall confidence level.Regarding the key assumptions from the outlook call. 2010 pension expense will be a little higher due to a 6% discount rate for our U.S. salary plan. But this expense increase will be offset by a lower tax rate in the 30% to 30.5% range. The strategic Defense realignment that we announced on January 5 will cause our total restructuring expense to increase to $55 million to $65 million. But keep in mind that this increased expense versus prior guidance is expected to be fully offset in 2010 by increased restructuring savings.For the first quarter of 2010, we are projecting EPS in the $0.73 to $0.75 range. At the mid-point, this represents the 3% improvement compared to the prior year. The first quarter of 2010 results include higher restructuring expenses associated with the Defense realignment. Despite improvement in both Commercial segment, first quarter revenues are expected to be down 1%, but that's due to a 7% decline in expense that reflects timing of radio and jammer shipments. Keep in mind that we expect full year 2010 Defense revenues to increase 3% to 4%, and incremental service contracts and international product activity are projected for the second half of 2010. So now with that overview, let me turn things over to Tom to begin the Q&A."

Having said that, in this environment as I mentioned, we do have a robust acquisition pipeline following the intentional pause that we put on it to preserve liquidity through the 2009 time period.

We did in fact, as a leadership team, going after a lot higher levels of productivity than we had before. So it was a combination of events that were out there and some of it was classic, if you will, in the sense that we were driving our traditional, value-based needs of save more, Kaizen [ph] culture. But we took this opportunity to be much more substantial, which was a very significant challenge, which was well done by the team, to actually close, to just get out there in the physical closing of a number of facilities, the moving of our manufacturing footprint more aggressively low-cost. We did spectacular progress last year in India, in China, in Poland and in the Czech Republic, as well as in Mexico in that regard. So a lot of that was really an acceleration of low-cost footprint. Munish Nanda and his team in operations achieved a remarkable increase in transitioning the global strategic sourcing to achieve our highest level of low-cost region sourcing, which is another source of material cost savings about the [ph] commodities and in finished goods. As I mentioned, I think we're in the 25% range. The cultural change was two-part, Jeff, and we really adopted it to the leadership team. What we wanted do was get the leadership mindset changed around. In this new economy, we are going to have to -- in a sustainably -- go after higher levels of product synergy as a way of life. Knowing that there was going to be more maturity in the top line coming out of this economic recession, we wanted to be able to index the premier earnings per share performance, which means that we need to get more productivity. So we have embarked on looking in new areas. First of all, as part of our vision is that customers are central in everything we do and what we mean by that is, we'll be taking all of our macro processes and driving structural productivity to streamline those macro customer processes, delivering order-entry responsiveness, technology speed to the market and so forth. Colin Sabol and Joe Vesey and his team were driving a very significant re-admission [ph] we call value-based customer excellence. And we have, as you know, several hundred million and an outstanding global footprint through our distribution capabilities, primarily our commercial businesses. And Joe and Colin and his team are really driving some contemporary processes both in terms of technology and in terms of customer focus that will provide a whole other level of productivity. So those are just some of the examples that clearly, the leadership team mindset shift that we identified is all about going after very meaningful, sustaining productivity. All the while knowing that that's ultimately get accrued, the competitive advantages and allow us to move in premier So as far as I'm concerned, I've been seeing for a long time that we have a lot of productivity opportunities in this company. They're getting harder to get, we have sensed that we got to focus on structural macro process and that's exactly what we're doing;;."

And what we're doing is just like we did in commercial, a lot of structural integration and leadership process improvement that I just mentioned. But having said that, the Defense environment really, in our view, is not changing despite acquisition reform initiatives. And that environment's still going to need their suppliers to earn the appropriate amount. Remember, a lot of the cost-plus business is cost-negotiated profit levels on a cost-justified basis. So a lot of transparency in that and that tends to be more operating margin. However, on the fixed price, pre-enterprise business management prevails in the Defense business and I think that I continue to see our ability to make margin in this business. So we're going to see some definite operating margin benefit improvement as a result of these activities. But however, we'll be impacted as Denise mentioned, by pension. Now, some amount of that pension is ultimately covered in retired senior rates, but quite frankly, it had not been for this pension, you would've seen a lot stronger margins in Defense for 2010. But even in the high 11s, in the low teens, that's exactly what we said we were going to be driving and Dave and his team are committed to improve the business metrics."

The Water is another area. Again, we already have several hundred million dollars in Water business buried, for the most part in our www franchise and this is a growing valuable space, which we can add-on to, both geographically and bolt-on acquisitions.

We're not totally surprised because we do understand the real nature of the Defense requirements. But here's for everyone's background if you're not familiar, we were looking at a $660 billion fiscal year '10 budget. And even though the new administration said they were not going to put in an additional FY '10 supplemental, he did it easily and he upped it by $33 billion dollars with the FY '10 finishing yet up over FY '09. And even though the administration likewise said that there was no way that the we're going to support defense budget increases, in fact they were very aggressive about saying they didn't see defense budget decrease into FY '11. What President Obama came out with this week was a yet 11.2% percent increase to the top line up now to a proposed $708 billion for the FY '11. This was actually not surprising. In fact, I was able, fortunately, two weeks ago to personally meet Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and he clearly articulated that he maintained the expectation that this local budget that was going to the prevail simply because of the needs which you all know about, in terms of force projection and vital recharge with our defense units. So if you all know that story, I think what you're seeing right now, is from a business piece, a positive affirmation from the administration that they also agree that we need to have a very, very strong defense as part of our overall national agenda. Specifically again, what we've seen is in the IED jamming area, there are a number of things that are still being retailed with respect to downstream competition opportunities with the CREW 2.1 series, as well as potential competitions on existing vehicles. We see some -- there was a package and very nice opportunities. There was a third opportunity for advancing competition with the Marine Corps and JIVE node, which is the IED office. Actually, they're all over a billion dollar budget increase. So that all needs to be detailed, but it's an upside for ITT. We saw a strong support with the increase in the nightvision budget and so that should enable some opportunity for us. And the same guys, while it's small but it's a validated move with a place over in there and the advanced active communication program budget will go up in the 6% to 7% range. So you add all that up and again, the details need to be sorted out and this is just the President's budget. There's an ongoing process to detail this. But we fundamentally think it was a positive for us. The other thing that I want to mention on this was at non-Defense, but the major initiative force, of course, is the ADS-B next-generation air traffic control technology for the FAA. And the FAA's budget went up about 25% over $1 billion in this area, underscoring the opportunity we've been working on with the next generation or the next programs after ADS-B, Datacom, SE 2020 and so forth. So what that means is the administration has realized that a strong component of driving new economic efficiencies is going to be getting a contemporary air traffic control system and they want to speed it up. So all in all, we've seen it as a slight positive for us."

Yes, it's working and we think the absolute of some of our revenue shares going to come from. On the margin side, there's going to be two forces at play. One is going to be the fact that's there's going to be intense competition for more defense contractors, as you can expect. But we would also get some benefits from this reorganization.

Right now, we are not seeing any specific trends in those pricing, although we certainly are expecting a little [ph] pricing environment means [ph]. Let me just take this moment to wrap up with all of you. First of all, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it's an important complement of our corporate citizenship strategy to make sure we give back to society in a meaningful way and I want to give you an update on our efforts in Haiti. Our approach to disaster response is very broad and multi-faceted and encompasses not only direct financial support, but also the contribution of our talented staff, products and services in both water treatment and emergency communications. Within days of the earthquake, ITT employees were on the ground and even provided emergency communications and disaster relief. We shipped five portable water treatment units, eight reverse osmosis units that are going to supply enough water to support 200,000 people. ITT employees are also making a significant direct financial contribution to the relief. And today, ITT's employee donations and ITT matching fund exceed more than $430,000. So I'll just highlight that these contributions, as well as other ones relate to ITT Water market offer substantial benefit to society and makes us all so proud about working here. So I'm going to use this an opportunity and see if this combination of who we are, our values-based work environment and our business strategy that enable us continued success. This roll bounce portfolio was the foundation of the results during 2009. And we're very proud of our teams around the globe for delivering on these commitments and as was highlighted during the call, some very significant increases in cost-side, cash-side productivity. We took important steps to position the company by advancing these productivity initiatives and increasing our strategic investment and generating strong free cash flow. So we believe that it is our innovation and essential focus with our products and services that position us to continue to grow well in the future, certainly at or above the markets we serve. We are very confident in our growth outlook for 2010. We got exceptional visibility of orders in our core markets and we've positive in winning [ph] achievements in our little [ph] cycle businesses. And more importantly, we think we've got the right leaders, strategy and resources in place to generate continued premier performance. We're confident in our ability to deliver 2010 as we've committed. I want to thank you all for joining us and we're off to a good start for the year."

And today extend for the hundreds of ITT employees who gladly joined us for this call, I want to personally thank you all of you and your teams for an exceptional performance and contribution in 2009. This was a year that our leadership and our 40,000 team members were challenged with volatile uncertainty, a year where swift decisions were required in the absence of clarity, and a year where our customers were equally challenged and were not able to predict even what their needs were. Given this situation, ITT employees chose to win, to steadfastly advance our strategy, to continue to invest in our customers’ vital growth areas and to invest in our own contribution to make the world better in safety, security, in vitality and in corporate citizenship. This unwavering commitment to our future was not without a price, but it was a price we willingly paid to enable ITT to now take advantage of our current opportunities. Winning in this new economy meant that we had to not only be steady with our strategy investments, but to ensure that our future viability was sound with exceptional execution in overdriving cost reductions, essentially establishing a new breakeven point for the company and by preserving our liquidity and protecting our balance sheet.This wasn't easy. 2009 was strategic [ph] for many of us. But we're now very energized because we did it all, exceeding our own expectations. What was most remarkable to me was that after all of our employees' hard work, we achieved our highest levels of employee engagement scores ever, with marked increases in the midst of our most challenging test. Not only did we finish with best-in-class business results, ITT was broadly recognized externally for our corporate responsibility with many accolades; we were ranked number 30 among the world's best companies by Newsweek's Green Ranking; we remained in the top 100 best corporate citizen by Corporate Responsibility Magazine; we are listed among the top 50 for employee diversity in engineering and IT professionals; we remained the top 10 military employer; and again, on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index; honored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations for our sustainability work in China; and then finally, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Corporate Stewardship Awards.So while this was our second best year ever in terms of business results, I believe it was our finest performance as a team. So I think it's worth capturing and recognizing some of our employees' terrific efforts in 2009, all of which was built on our strategic foundation and our esprit de corps as a company.In 2009, we focused on managing our supply chain, ensuring our cost inputs were synchronized with reductions in volume, and we drove cycle-time reductions to ensure that volatile changes in the flow of goods were matched with the appropriate levels of working capital. We performed extremely well operationally. And on top of that, we increased customer satisfaction in 40 engagements, as I mentioned, and we accelerated our long-term strategy.On customers. We aligned with customer's need, invested in new technologies, and we consolidated Motion & Flow Control value centers around some customer solutions. The proof of these advances were evident in our impressive list of significant contract wins in 2009. These included: The CREW 3.3 jamming program; the Japanese weather satellite; an Indian irrigation project; as well as a very large Brazilian oil and gas project; a new program on one of the world's largest desalination plants in Saudi; Ford Taurus, Escape and Focus component; and global railway in India and China.On cost. We repositioned our cost structure. We exceeded our original restructuring plan by investing in and executing a total of $178 million of restructuring actions since the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a very significant 10% reduction in our Commercial business workforce. We reduced our overall manufacturing footprint by 1 million square feet. We consolidated 10 locations, and we grew our low-cost region in manufacturing and sourcing presence by over 25% year-over-year. All of these decisions were difficult because of the impact on our employees. But they're also the right moves to position our company for the long term. We also implemented merit freezes and incentive pay reductions for all executives, while significantly reducing discretionary spending. On capital. We set a new free cash flow record of $1 billion in 2009. We've paid down $640 million of debt, and we termed down $1 billion of commercial paper. We acquired an energy-efficient circulator manufacturing with the Laing acquisition, which has greatly exceeded our expectations. During 2009, we dramatically improved our financial capacity, and despite our purposeful pause on acquisitions during 2009, today we have a robust pipeline of opportunities. On operations. We delivered over $500 million in gross productivity. The structural changes made to optimize our sourcing and these succeeding initiatives will provide lasting benefits. We also streamlined the oversight of our Fluid and Motion segments, and we plan for similar activity within the defense strategic realignment, which we are executing now.True leadership emerges from two challenges, and our 2009 execution further underscores how strong our leaders are in ITT. We did not sit back and wait for the downturn to end. We proactively attacked it with courage and focus. And as a result, we did end here a challenging 2009 as a much stronger company. So the progress we've made in advancing our strategy really positioned us for continued strong growth in the future.Turning to Slide 4. With the 2009, we ended our backs. Let's take a look at 2010's strategic priorities: Strategic execution, differentiated organic growth and portfolio alignment. We're confident that we will continue to leverage the ITT management system to deliver strong sales growth, improve productivity and solid free cash flow. Our recent investment in operations to excellence, growth initiatives and defense transformation will accelerate our progress.So given the strength of our business, my primary focus in 2010 will be our portfolio actions around the growing macro trends such as aging infrastructure, growing middle class, water needs and global security. We will pursue fluid adjacencies, emerging market opportunities, air traffic control and cyber security. We have the financial capacity to further this alignment, and we have the leadership teams that know how to invest, integrate and deliver.On Slide 5. Our Defense segment has been positioned to support our customer's emerging technology needs, while also growing and enhancing our ability to stake out new markets. We believe that this change will also allow ITT to achieve greater operating efficiencies and optimize our cost structure. Here's what the new segment, named ITT Defense and Information Solutions, looks like. Our Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and a portion of our Intelligence & Information Warfare units will combine to a $2.6 billion Electronic Systems division. This division will deliver advanced protection measures to help ITT customers defend their networks and disable enemy networks. Improved leveraging of technology will significantly advance our position in two programs like the JTRS, airborne-endowed [ph] electronic warfare and CREW 3.3 development, where the jamming, networking and communicating technologies are all integrated program elements.Our Space Systems and Night Vision units will combine to form Geospatial Systems. This new $1.2 billion value center will focus on next-generation energy that integrates space, airborne, ground and soldiers sensors into broader, coordinated systems. This combination will improve our competitiveness in the areas of digitally-enhanced night vision goggles, unmanned aerial vehicles and integrated intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions.Our Advanced Engineering & Sciences and our systems units were combined with part of Intelligent & Information Warfare to form Information Systems. This new $2.5 billion value center focus will be our network decision solution by combining large systems operations with the sophisticated techniques in information integration and protection. With powerful combination, we'll advance opportunities in the FAA's Next Generation air traffic management solutions, NASA programs and national intelligence networks as well as cyber security. We are very, very pleased with this initiative to substantially reposition our definitive Information Solutions business for the future. And now, Denise will review the business."

So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, c",1375,"Thanks, Steve. So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, compared to the prior year. The enduring nature of the demand for our products and our strong execution helped generate these solid results even in difficult market conditions. Our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of $0.97 was 18% higher than the prior year due to the benefits from our productivity initiatives, prior restructuring actions and lower restructuring and realignment cost that more than offset lower volumes and cost increases. For the full year, our adjusted EPS of $3.78 was down only 6%. And let me make an observation here. If you adjust for what I'll call non-operating items, both favorable and unfavorable, items such as FX, pension, restructuring and acquisitions, our 2009 operating EPS is down only 2% to 2008. Not many peers were able to deliver that kind of performance in 2009. Compared to the increased guidance mid-point that we just provided you on the guidance call on December 18, our adjusted 2009 EPS was $0.05 stronger. And that was due to slightly improved operating performances and lower non-operating expenses, partially offset by increased restructuring actions. Organic orders improved 3% compared to the prior year, and that was on strength in many of our key end markets, while difficult compared remains in industrial, commercial and aerospace. Sequential order growth of 25% reflected strength of Defense and positive performances at both Fluid and Motion. We are confident in our 2010 revenue forecasts, and our recent order trends and quoting activity is starting to pick up in some of the longer-cycle businesses. So not only did we deliver our best-in-class EPS performance in 2009, but we also greatly improved our financial position. Turn to Slide 7. In 2009, we generated a record $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding the after-tax impact of a $100 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the fourth quarter. This free cash flow performance was 22% better than the prior year, and it reflected a 146% conversion of continuing net income adjusted for non-cash special items. Our working capital, as a percent of sales, improved 70 basis points to 12.4%. And our net-debt-to-net-capital ratio declined from 27.9% at the beginning of the year to just 7% at the end of 2009. In addition, we have nearly exited the short-term commercial paper market, and we do have over $1.2 billion in cash. Now let's turn to Fluid Technology's fourth quarter results that's on Slide 8. Fluid delivered a solid Q4 that was actually better than our internal expectations due to improved top-line performances. The 13% organic revenue decline reflected continued strength in municipal markets that was offset by anticipated declines in industrial and commercial markets. Productivity gained momentum all year at Fluid and has repeatedly helped to mitigate lower volume and cost increases.Organic orders in the quarter were down 2%, but they were ahead of expectations. Front order activity was seen in the municipal treatment in transport, mining and oil and gas markets. The strength was more than offset by weaker global commercial and North American industrial orders. Sequential orders were slightly positive, and leading indicators on industrial activities have turned more favorable recently. For example, sequential organic orders at industrial process decreased 6%, and the book-to-bill rate in the quarter was 1.03. Also in the quarter, Fluid won a significant $20 million oil and gas contract in Brazil and a $7 million desalination project in Saudi Arabia. So with this latest win in Saudi Arabia, ITT now has products in three of the five largest desalinating facilities in the world. A view of the Motion Flow controls, our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. Motion revenue was down only 1% organically due to aerospace and general industrial weakness that was nearly offset by strong results in the automotive, rail, beverage and marine markets. In all of these segments, our competitive advantages drove market share gains during the downturn. And let's keep in mind that these share gains will be produced on our much more efficient manufacturing platform going forward.Operating margins improved 610 basis points in total and 230 basis points operationally compared to the prior year. This performance does reflect both the lower restructuring cost in the quarter and the aggregate benefit of two years of restructuring and realignment going back to 2008 but now total $84 million.Organic orders improved 7% with big gains at flow control and motion technology. We are taking share in food and beverage markets. We are winning significant global platforms in auto and rail. And we are seeing some general signs of stability in the connectors and general industrial markets. We do expect that aerospace will remain under pressure, but on the whole, Motion & Flow Control has clearly emerged from this past downturn as a leaner, more competitively-focused collection of growing businesses.Let's turn to Defense on Slide 10. The slight organic revenue decline in the quarter was consistent with our latest expectations. Service growth was strong with increased activity on a number of different contracts, including Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA Next Generation air traffic control program, ADS-B. International Night Vision grew significantly in the fourth quarter, and we expect continued strength into 2010. Increases in airborne electronic warfare were partially offset -- our lower ground electronic warfare, and SINCGARS volumes were down versus a strong prior year. Organic order growth of 5% brought our year-end defense backlog to $5.2 billion, generally flat the prior-year levels with little change in the mix of products and services. New order growth reflected anticipated replenishments of service contract fundings and a significant Japanese weather satellite order that more than offset lower ground electronic warfare orders.Productivity continued to be strong with 120 basis points of operational improvement in the quarter. So this strong performance pushed the full year defense margins up to a record 12.3%. Our recently announced Defense strategic realignment, coupled with the continuation of our productivity actions, will nicely benefit long-term Defense segment margins.Now let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about the 2010 guidance. So our strong Q4 performance has set us up very nicely on moving into 2010. Further stabilization in key end markets plus expanded productivity actions and increased confidence in our execution of these actions have contributed to our decision to increase our 2010 EPS guidance by $0.05 to $3.90 to $4.10. Now let me point out that our new 2010 EPS range is already back in line with our pre-economic downturn 2008 adjusted EPS, a remarkable accomplishment in a relatively short period of time. Sentimentally, our revenue guidance remained unchanged from the December outlook call. We are still projecting organic growth revenue growth in the 2% range, but future indicators have improved since December, increasing our overall confidence level.Regarding the key assumptions from the outlook call. 2010 pension expense will be a little higher due to a 6% discount rate for our U.S. salary plan. But this expense increase will be offset by a lower tax rate in the 30% to 30.5% range. The strategic Defense realignment that we announced on January 5 will cause our total restructuring expense to increase to $55 million to $65 million. But keep in mind that this increased expense versus prior guidance is expected to be fully offset in 2010 by increased restructuring savings.For the first quarter of 2010, we are projecting EPS in the $0.73 to $0.75 range. At the mid-point, this represents the 3% improvement compared to the prior year. The first quarter of 2010 results include higher restructuring expenses associated with the Defense realignment. Despite improvement in both Commercial segment, first quarter revenues are expected to be down 1%, but that's due to a 7% decline in expense that reflects timing of radio and jammer shipments.

We did in fact, as a leadership team, go after a lot higher levels of productivity than we had before. So it was a combination of events that we really went after, and some of it was classic, if you will, in the sense that we were driving our traditional, value-based needs of save more, Kaizen [ph] culture. But we took this opportunity to be much more substantial, which was a very significant challenge, which was well done by the team, to actually close, to just get out there the physical closing of a number of facilities, the moving of our manufacturing footprint more aggressively to low-cost regions. We made spectacular progress last year in India, in China, in Poland and in the Czech Republic, as well as in Mexico in that regard. So a lot of that was really an acceleration of low-cost footprint. Munish Nanda and his team in operations achieved a remarkable increase in transitioning the global strategic sourcing to achieve our highest level of low-cost region sourcing, which is another source of material cost savings both in commodities and in finished goods. As I mentioned, I think we're in the 25% range. The cultural change was two-part, Jeff, and we really adopted it to the leadership team. What we wanted do was get the leadership mindset changed around. In this new economy, we are going to have to -- in a sustainably -- go after higher levels of product synergy as a way of life. Knowing that there was going to be more maturity in the top line coming out of this economic recession, we wanted to be able to index the premier earnings per share performance, which means that we need to get more productivity. So we have embarked on looking in new areas. First of all, as part of our vision is that customers are central in everything we do and what we mean by that is, we'll be taking all of our macro processes and driving structural productivity to streamline those macro customer processes, delivering order-entry responsiveness, technology speed to the market and so forth. Colin Sabol and Joe Vesey and his team were driving a very significant re-admission [ph] we call value-based customer excellence. And we have, as you know, several hundred million and an outstanding global footprint through our distribution capabilities, primarily our commercial businesses. And Joe and Colin and his team are really driving some contemporary processes both in terms of technology and in terms of customer focus that will provide a whole other level of productivity. So those are just some of the examples that clearly, the leadership team mindset shift that we identified is all about going after very meaningful, sustaining productivity. All the while knowing that that's ultimately get accrued, the competitive advantages and allow us to move in premier So as far as I'm concerned, I've been seeing for a long time that we have a lot of productivity opportunities in this company.

But having said that, the Defense environment really, in our view, is not changing despite acquisition reform initiatives. And that environment's still going to need their suppliers to earn the appropriate amount. Remember, a lot of the cost-plus business is cost-negotiated profit levels on a cost-justified basis. So a lot of transparency in that and that tends to be more operating margin. However, on the fixed price, pre-enterprise business management prevails in the Defense business and I think that I continue to see our ability to make margin in this business. So we're going to see some definite operating margin benefit improvement as a result of these activities. But however, we'll be impacted as Denise mentioned, by pension. Now, some amount of that pension is ultimately covered in retired senior rates, but quite frankly, it had not been for this pension, you would've seen a lot stronger margins in Defense for 2010.

But h",584,"The request answered to the most recent released Presidential budget that we're extremely pleased with it. It does represent an upside to our thinking. We're not totally surprised because we do understand the real nature of the Defense requirements. But here's for everyone's background if you're not familiar, we were looking at a $660 billion fiscal year '10 budget. And even though the new administration said they were not going to put in an additional FY '10 supplemental, he did it easily and he upped it by $33 billion dollars with the FY '10 finishing yet up over FY '09. And even though the administration likewise said that there was no way that the we're going to support defense budget increases, in fact they were very aggressive about saying they didn't see defense budget decrease into FY '11. What President Obama came out with this week was a yet 11.2% percent increase to the top line up now to a proposed $708 billion for the FY '11. This was actually not surprising. In fact, I was able, fortunately, two weeks ago to personally meet Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and he clearly articulated that he maintained the expectation that this local budget that was going to the prevail simply because of the needs which you all know about, in terms of force projection and vital recharge with our defense units. So if you all know that story, I think what you're seeing right now, is from a business piece, a positive affirmation from the administration that they also agree that we need to have a very, very strong defense as part of our overall national agenda. Specifically again, what we've seen is in the IED jamming area, there are a number of things that are still being retailed with respect to downstream competition opportunities with the CREW 2.1 series, as well as potential competitions on existing vehicles. We see some -- there was a package and very nice opportunities. There was a third opportunity for advancing competition with the Marine Corps and JIVE node, which is the IED office. Actually, they're all over a billion dollar budget increase. So that all needs to be detailed, but it's an upside for ITT. We saw a strong support with the increase in the night vision budget and so that should enable some opportunity for us. And the same guys, while it's small but it's a validated move with a place over in there and the advanced active communication program budget will go up in the 6% to 7% range. So you add all that up and again, the details need to be sorted out and this is just the President's budget. There's an ongoing process to detail this. But we fundamentally think it was a positive for us. The other thing that I want to mention on this was at non-Defense, but the major initiative force, of course, is the ADS-B next-generation air traffic control technology for the FAA. And the FAA's budget went up about 25% over $1 billion in this area, underscoring the opportunity we've been working on with the next generation or the next programs after ADS-B, Datacom, SE 2020 and so forth. So what that means is the administration has realized that a strong component of driving new economic efficiencies is going to be getting a contemporary air traffic control system and they want to speed it up. So all in all, we've seen it as a slight positive for us."

And obviously  here, with the 2011 budget indications and your commentary here, it sounds like maybe there's some upside to that. I guess within that context though, it sounds like maybe some of the upside comes from the product side of the house, which I'm wondering as we go back to parse through all the mix issues, it doesn't have some positive margin implications.

And so when we gave you a slight up, what we were thinking of at that time is we're going to withstand some of these adjacencies. We've been talking about like the air traffic management, like some of the NASA surveillance, like some of the international programs. So remember, compared to where we were, say five years ago, when we were almost exclusive with the Department of Defense, we today have almost 25% of our Defense businesses is what you would call non-DOD. But that's just saying that building -- our $1.5 billion business space outside of our core business. So here's the strategy that we've been talking about. Yes, it's working and we think the absolute of some of our revenue shares going to come from. On the margin side, there's going to be two forces at play. One is going to be the fact that's there's going to be intense competition for more defense contractors, as you can expect. But we would also get some benefits from this reorganization.

First of all, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it's an important complement of our corporate citizenship strategy to make sure we give back to society in a meaningful way and I want to give you an update on our efforts in Haiti. Our approach to disaster response is very broad and multi-faceted and encompasses not only direct financial support, but also the contribution of our talented staff, products and services in both water treatment and emergency communications. Within days of the earthquake, ITT employees were on the ground and even provided emergency communications and disaster relief. We shipped five portable water treatment units, eight reverse osmosis units that are going to supply enough water to support 200,000 people. ITT employees are also making a significant direct financial contribution to the relief. And today, ITT's employee donations and ITT matching fund exceed more than $430,000. So I'll just highlight that these contributions, as well as other ones relate to ITT Water market offer substantial benefit to society and makes us all so proud about working here. So I'm going to use this an opportunity and see if this combination of who we are, our values-based work environment and our business strategy that enable us continued success. This roll bounce portfolio was the foundation of the results during 2009. And we're very proud of our teams around the globe for delivering on these commitments and as was highlighted during the call, some very significant increases in cost-side, cash-side productivity. We took important steps to position the company by advancing these productivity initiatives and increasing our strategic investment and generating strong free cash flow. So we believe that it is our innovation and essential focus with our products and services that position us to continue to grow well in the future, certainly at or above the markets we serve. We are very confident in our growth outlook for 2010. We got exceptional visibility of orders in our core markets and we've positive in winning [ph] achievements in our little [ph] cycle businesses. And more importantly, we think we've got the right leaders, strategy and resources in place to generate continued premier performance. We're confident in our ability to deliver 2010 as we've committed. I want to thank you all for joining us and we're off to a good start for the year."

What was most remarkable to me was that after all of our employees' hard work, we achieved our highest levels of employee engagement scores ever, with marked increases in the midst of our most challenging test. Not only did we finish with best-in-class business results, ITT was broadly recognized externally for our corporate responsibility with many accolades; we were ranked number 30 among the world's best companies by Newsweek's Green Ranking; we remained in the top 100 best corporate citizen by Corporate Responsibility Magazine; we are listed among the top 50 for employee diversity in engineering and IT professionals; we remained the top 10 military employer; and again, on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index; honored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations for our sustainability work in China; and then finally, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Corporate Stewardship Awards.So while this was our second best year ever in terms of business results, I believe it was our finest performance as a team. So I think it's worth capturing and recognizing some of our employees' terrific efforts in 2009, all of which was built on our strategic foundation and our esprit de corps as a company.In 2009, we focused on managing our supply chain, ensuring our cost inputs were synchronized with reductions in volume, and we drove cycle-time reductions to ensure that volatile changes in the flow of goods were matched with the appropriate levels of working capital. We performed extremely well operationally. And on top of that, we increased customer satisfaction in 40 engagements, as I mentioned, and we accelerated our long-term strategy.On customers. We aligned with customer's need, invested in new technologies, and we consolidated Motion & Flow Control value centers around some customer solutions. The proof of these advances were evident in our impressive list of significant contract wins in 2009. These included: The CREW 3.3 jamming program; the Japanese weather satellite; an Indian irrigation project; as well as a very large Brazilian oil and gas project; a new program on one of the world's largest desalination plants in Saudi; Ford Taurus, Escape and Focus component; and global railway in India and China.On cost. We repositioned our cost structure. We exceeded our original restructuring plan by investing in and executing a total of $178 million of restructuring actions since the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a very significant 10% reduction in our Commercial business workforce. We reduced our overall manufacturing footprint by 1 million square feet. We consolidated 10 locations, and we grew our low-cost region in manufacturing and sourcing presence by over 25% year-over-year. All of these decisions were difficult because of the impact on our employees. But they're also the right moves to position our company for the long term. We also implemented merit freezes and incentive pay reductions for all executives, while significantly reducing discretionary spending. On capital. We set a new free cash flow record of $1 billion in 2009. We've paid down $640 million of debt, and we termed out $1 billion of commercial fees. We acquired an energy-efficient circulator manufacturing with the Laing acquisition, which has greatly exceeded our expectations. During 2009, we dramatically improved our financial capacity, and despite our purposeful pause on acquisitions during 2009, today we have a robust pipeline of opportunities. On operations. We delivered over $500 million in gross productivity. The structural changes made to optimize our sourcing and these succeeding initiatives will provide lasting benefits. We also streamlined the oversight of our Fluid and Motion segments, and we plan for similar activity within the Defense strategic realignment, which we are executing now.True leadership emerges from two challenges, and our 2009 execution further underscores how strong our leaders are in ITT. We did not sit back and wait for the downturn to end. We proactively attacked it with courage and focus. And as a result, we did end in a challenging 2009 as a much stronger company. So the progress we've made in advancing our strategy really positioned us for continued strong growth in the future.Turning to Slide 4. With the 2009, we ended our backs. Let's take a look at 2010's strategic priorities: Strategic execution, differentiated organic growth and portfolio alignment. We're confident that we will continue to leverage the ITT management system to deliver strong sales growth, improve productivity and solid free cash flow. Our recent investment in operation's excellence, growth initiatives and the defense transformation will accelerate our progress.So given the strength of our business, my primary focus in 2010 will be on portfolio actions around growing macro trends, such as aging infrastructure, growing middle class, water needs and global security. We will pursue fluid adjacencies, emerging market opportunities, air traffic control and cyber security. We have the financial capacity to further this alignment, and we have the leadership teams that know how to invest, integrate and deliver.On Slide 5. Our Defense segment has been positioned to support our customers' emerging technology needs, while also greatly enhancing our ability to stake out new markets. We believe that this change will also allow ITT to achieve greater operating efficiencies and optimize our cost structure. Here's what the new segment, named ITT Defense and Information Solutions, looks like. Our Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and a portion of our Intelligence & Information Warfare units will combine to a $2.6 billion Electronic Systems division. This division will deliver advanced protection measures to help ITT customers defend their networks and disable enemy networks. Improved leveraging and technology will significantly enhance our position in the key [ph] programs like the JTRS, Airborne and Ground Electronic Warfare and CREW 3.3 developed, where jamming, networking and communicating technologies are all integrated program elements.Our Space Systems and Night Vision units will combine to form Geospatial Systems. This new $1.2 billion-valued [ph] center will focus on next-generation imaging that integrates space, airborne, ground and soldier sensors into broader, coordinated systems. This combination will improve our competitiveness in the areas of digital-enhanced night vision goggles, unmanned aerial vehicles and integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance solutions.Our Advanced Engineering & Sciences and our Systems units were combined with part of Intelligence & Information Warfare to form Information Systems. This new $2.5 billion-valued [ph] center focus will be on networked decision solution by combining large systems operations with the sophisticated techniques in information integration and protection. This powerful combination advance opportunities in the FAA's Next Generation air traffic management solutions, NASA programs and national intelligence networks as well as cyber security. We are very, very pleased that this initiatives will substantially reposition our definitive Information Solutions business for the future. And now, Denise will review the business."

So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, c",1382,"Thanks, Steve. So like Steve, I am very proud of our 2009 financial performances. Now let's take a closer look at some of the specific results.In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered organic revenue performances that were down only 5%, compared to the prior year. The enduring nature of the demand for our products and our strong execution helped generate these solid results even in difficult market conditions. Our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of $0.97 was 18% higher than the prior year due to the benefits from our productivity initiatives, prior restructuring actions and lower restructuring and realignment cost that more than offset lower volumes and cost increases. For the full year, our adjusted EPS of $3.78 was down only 6%. And let me make an observation here. If you adjust for what I'll call non-operating items, both favorable and unfavorable, items such as FX, pension, restructuring and acquisitions, our 2009 operating EPS was down only 2% for 2008. Not many peers were able to deliver that kind of performance in 2009. Compared to the increased guidance mid-point that we just provided you on the guidance call on December 18, our adjusted 2009 EPS was $0.05 stronger. And that was due to slightly improved operating performances and lower non-operating expenses, partially offset by increased restructuring actions. Organic orders improved 3% compared to the prior year, and that was on strength in many of our key end markets, while difficult compared with main [ph] in industrial, commercial and aerospace. Sequential order growth of 25% reflected strength of Defense and positive performances at both Fluid and Motion. We are confident in our 2010 revenue forecasts, and our recent order trends and quoting activity is starting to pick up in some of the longer-cycle businesses. So not only did we deliver a best-in-class EPS performance in 2009, but we also greatly improved our financial position. Turn to Slide 7. In 2009, we generated a record $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding the after-tax impact of a $100 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the fourth quarter. This free cash flow performance was 22% better than the prior year, and it reflected a 146% conversion of continuing net income adjusted for non-cash special items. Our working capital, as a percent of sales, improved 70 basis points to 12.4%. And our net debt to net capital ratio declined from 27.9% at the beginning of the year to just 7% at the end of 2009. In addition, we have nearly exited the short-term commercial paper market, and we do have over $1.2 billion in cash. Now let's turn to Fluid Technology's fourth quarter results that's on Slide 8. Fluid delivered a solid Q4 that was actually better than our internal expectations due to improved top-line performances. The 13% organic revenue decline reflected continued strength in municipal markets that was offset by anticipated declines in industrial and commercial markets. Productivity gained momentum all year at Fluid and has repeatedly helped to mitigate lower volume and cost increases.Organic orders in the quarter were down 2%, but they were ahead of expectations. Front order activity was seen in the municipal treatment in transport, mining and oil and gas markets. The strength was more than offset by weaker global commercial and North American industrial orders. Sequential orders were slightly positive, and leading indicators on industrial activities have turned more favorable recently. For example, sequential organic orders at industrial process decreased 6%, and the book-to-bill rate in the quarter was 1.03. Also in the quarter, Fluid won a significant $20 million oil and gas contract in Brazil and a $7 million desalination project in Saudi Arabia. So with this latest win in Saudi Arabia, ITT now has products in three of the five largest desalinating facilities in the world. Our Fluid and Motion and Flow controls with their fourth quarter results on Slide 9. Motion revenue was down only 1% organically due to aerospace and general industrial weakness that was nearly offset by strong results in the automotive, rail, beverage and marine markets. In all of these segments, our competitive advantages drove market share gains during the downturn. And let's keep in mind that these share gains will be produced on our much more efficient manufacturing platform going forward.Operating margins improved 610 basis points in total and 230 basis points operationally compared to the prior year. This performance does reflect both the lower restructuring cost in the quarter and the aggregate benefit of two years of restructuring and realignment going back to 2008 but now total $84 million.Organic orders improved 7% with big gains at flow control and motion technology. We are taking share in food and beverage markets. We are winning significant global platforms in auto and rail. And we are seeing some general signs of stability in the connectors and general industrial markets. We do expect that aerospace will remain under pressure, but on the whole, Motion & Flow Control has clearly emerged from this past downturn as a leaner, more competitively-focused collection of growing businesses.Let's turn to Defense on Slide 10. The slight organic revenue decline in the quarter was consistent with our latest expectations. Service growth was strong with increased activity on a number of different contracts, including Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA Next Generation air traffic control program, ADS-B. International Night Vision grew significantly in the fourth quarter, and we expect continued strength into 2010. Increases in airborne electronic warfare were partially offset -- our lower ground electronic warfare, and SINCGARS volumes were down versus a strong prior year. Organic order growth of 5% brought our year-end defense backlog to $5.2 billion, generally flat the prior-year levels with little change in the mix of products and services. New order growth reflected anticipated replenishments of service contract fundings and a significant Japanese weather satellite order that more than offset lower ground electronic warfare orders.Productivity continued to be strong with 120 basis points of operational improvement in the quarter. So this strong performance pushed the full year defense margins up to a record 12.3%. Our recently announced Defense strategic realignment, coupled with the continuation of our productivity actions, will nicely benefit long-term Defense segment margins.Now let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about the 2010 guidance. So our strong Q4 performance has set us up very nicely on moving into 2010. Further stabilization in key end markets plus expanded productivity actions and increased confidence in our execution of these actions have contributed to our decision to increase our 2010 EPS guidance by $0.05 to $3.90 to $4.10. Now let me point out that our new 2010 EPS range is already back in line with our pre-economic downturn 2008 adjusted EPS, a remarkable accomplishment in a relatively short period of time. Sentimentally, our revenue guidance remained unchanged from the December outlook call. We are still projecting organic growth revenue growth in the 2% range, but future indicators have improved since December, increasing our overall confidence level.Regarding the key assumptions from the outlook call. 2010 pension expense will be a little higher due to a 6% discount rate for our U.S. salary plan. But this expense increase will be offset by a lower tax rate in the 30% to 30.5% range. The strategic Defense realignment that we announced on January 5 will cause our total restructuring expense to increase to $55 million to $65 million. But keep in mind that this increased expense versus prior guidance is expected to be fully offset in 2010 by increased restructuring savings.For the first quarter of 2010, we are projecting EPS in the $0.73 to $0.75 range. At the mid-point, this represents the 3% improvement compared to the prior year. The first quarter of 2010 results include higher restructuring expenses associated with the Defense realignment. Despite improvement in both Commercial segment, first quarter revenues are expected to be down 1%, but that's due to a 7% decline in expense that reflects timing of radio and jammer shipments. Keep in mind that we expect full year 2010 Defense revenues to increase 3% to 4%, and incremental service contracts and international product activity are projected for the second half of 2010. So now with that overview, let me turn things over to Tom to begin the Q&A."

We have other activities around the Rail and around aerospace and around other components of our business. But I think you're correct by saying those three really form the basis of our near-term focus. Having said that, in this environment as I mentioned, we do have a robust acquisition pipeline following the intentional pause that we put on it to preserve liquidity through the 2009 time period. So we're not anticipating any change in our share buyback, which is to say, that's on pause. Right now, we plan on deploying our cash responsibly of course, but primarily in the acquisition area."

I mentioned in my opening comments that we paid a price for our performance and quite frankly, that was one of them. We did in fact, as a leadership team, go after a lot higher levels of productivity than we had before. So it was a combination of events that we really went after, and some of it was classic, if you will, in the sense that we were driving our traditional, value-based needs of save more, Kaizen [ph] culture. But we took this opportunity to be much more substantial, which was a very significant challenge, which was well done by the team, to actually close, to just get out there the physical closing of a number of facilities, the moving of our manufacturing footprint more aggressively to low-cost regions. We made spectacular progress last year in India, in China, in Poland and in the Czech Republic, as well as in Mexico in that regard. So a lot of that was really an acceleration of low-cost footprint. Munish Nanda and his team in operations achieved a remarkable increase in transitioning the global strategic sourcing to achieve our highest level of low-cost region sourcing, which is another source of material cost savings both in commodities and in finished goods. As I mentioned, I think we're in the 25% range. The cultural change was two-part, Jeff, and we really adopted it to the leadership team. What we wanted do was get the leadership mindset changed around. In this new economy, we are going to have to -- in a sustainably -- go after higher levels of product synergy as a way of life. Knowing that there was going to be more maturity in the top line coming out of this economic recession, we wanted to be able to index the premier earnings per share performance, which means that we need to get more productivity. So we have embarked on looking in new areas. First of all, as part of our vision is that customers are central in everything we do and what we mean by that is, we'll be taking all of our macro processes and driving structural productivity to streamline those macro customer processes, delivering order-entry responsiveness, technology speed to the market and so forth. Colin Sabol and Joe Vesey and his team were driving a very significant re-admission [ph] we call value-based customer excellence. And we have, as you know, several hundred million and an outstanding global footprint through our distribution capabilities, primarily our commercial businesses. And Joe and Colin and his team are really driving some contemporary processes both in terms of technology and in terms of customer focus that will provide a whole other level of productivity. So those are just some of the examples that clearly, the leadership team mindset shift that we identified is all about going after very meaningful, sustaining productivity. All the while knowing that that's ultimately get accrued, the competitive advantages and allow us to move in premier So as far as I'm concerned, I've been seeing for a long time that we have a lot of productivity opportunities in this company. They're getting harder to get, we have sensed that we got to focus on structural macro process and that's exactly what we're doing."

And what we're doing is just like we did in commercial, a lot of structural integration and leadership process improvement that I just mentioned. But having said that, the Defense environment really, in our view, is not changing despite acquisition reform initiatives. And that environment's still going to need their suppliers to earn the appropriate amount. Remember, a lot of the cost-plus business is cost-negotiated profit levels on a cost-justified basis. So a lot of transparency in that and that tends to be more operating margin. However, on the fixed price, pre-enterprise business management prevails in the Defense business and I think that I continue to see our ability to make margin in this business. So we're going to see some definite operating margin benefit improvement as a result of these activities. But however, we'll be impacted as Denise mentioned, by pension. Now, some amount of that pension is ultimately covered in retired senior rates, but quite frankly, it had not been for this pension, you would've seen a lot stronger margins in Defense for 2010. But even in the high 11s, in the low teens, that's exactly what we said we were going to be driving and Dave and his team are committed to improve the business metrics."

The Water is another area. Again, we already have several hundred million dollars in Water business buried, for the most part in our www franchise and this is a growing valuable space, which we can add-on to, both geographically and bolt-on acquisitions. And then finally in treatment, the areas of treatment that we like to grow in have to do with the membrane, ultra- and micro-filtration membrane participation and some opportunities there.

We're not totally surprised because we do understand the real nature of the Defense requirements. But here's for everyone's background if you're not familiar, we were looking at a $660 billion fiscal year '10 budget. And even though the new administration said they were not going to put in an additional FY '10 supplemental, he did it easily and he upped it by $33 billion dollars with the FY '10 finishing yet up over FY '09. And even though the administration likewise said that there was no way that the we're going to support defense budget increases, in fact they were very aggressive about saying they didn't see defense budget decrease into FY '11. What President Obama came out with this week was a yet 11.2% percent increase to the top line up now to a proposed $708 billion for the FY '11. This was actually not surprising. In fact, I was able, fortunately, two weeks ago to personally meet Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and he clearly articulated that he maintained the expectation that this local budget that was going to the prevail simply because of the needs which you all know about, in terms of force projection and vital recharge with our defense units. So if you all know that story, I think what you're seeing right now, is from a business piece, a positive affirmation from the administration that they also agree that we need to have a very, very strong defense as part of our overall national agenda. Specifically again, what we've seen is in the IED jamming area, there are a number of things that are still being retailed with respect to downstream competition opportunities with the CREW 2.1 series, as well as potential competitions on existing vehicles. We see some -- there was a package and very nice opportunities. There was a third opportunity for advancing competition with the Marine Corps and JIVE node, which is the IED office. Actually, they're all over a billion dollar budget increase. So that all needs to be detailed, but it's an upside for ITT. We saw a strong support with the increase in the night vision budget and so that should enable some opportunity for us. And the same guys, while it's small but it's a validated move with a place over in there and the advanced active communication program budget will go up in the 6% to 7% range. So you add all that up and again, the details need to be sorted out and this is just the President's budget. There's an ongoing process to detail this. But we fundamentally think it was a positive for us. The other thing that I want to mention on this was at non-Defense, but the major initiative force, of course, is the ADS-B next-generation air traffic control technology for the FAA. And the FAA's budget went up about 25% over $1 billion in this area, underscoring the opportunity we've been working on with the next generation or the next programs after ADS-B, Datacom, SE 2020 and so forth. So what that means is the administration has realized that a strong component of driving new economic efficiencies is going to be getting a contemporary air traffic control system and they want to speed it up. So all in all, we've seen it as a slight positive for us."

But that's just saying that building -- our $1.5 billion business space outside of our core business. So here's the strategy that we've been talking about. Yes, it's working and we think the absolute of some of our revenue shares going to come from. On the margin side, there's going to be two forces at play. One is going to be the fact that's there's going to be intense competition for more defense contractors, as you can expect. But we would also get some benefits from this reorganization.

Right now, we are not seeing any specific trends in those pricing, although we certainly are expecting a little [ph] pricing environment means [ph]. Let me just take this moment to wrap up with all of you. First of all, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it's an important complement of our corporate citizenship strategy to make sure we give back to society in a meaningful way and I want to give you an update on our efforts in Haiti. Our approach to disaster response is very broad and multi-faceted and encompasses not only direct financial support, but also the contribution of our talented staff, products and services in both water treatment and emergency communications. Within days of the earthquake, ITT employees were on the ground and even provided emergency communications and disaster relief. We shipped five portable water treatment units, eight reverse osmosis units that are going to supply enough water to support 200,000 people. ITT employees are also making a significant direct financial contribution to the relief. And today, ITT's employee donations and ITT matching fund exceed more than $430,000. So I'll just highlight that these contributions, as well as other ones relate to ITT Water market offer substantial benefit to society and makes us all so proud about working here. So I'm going to use this an opportunity and see if this combination of who we are, our values-based work environment and our business strategy that enable us continued success. This roll bounce portfolio was the foundation of the results during 2009. And we're very proud of our teams around the globe for delivering on these commitments and as was highlighted during the call, some very significant increases in cost-side, cash-side productivity. We took important steps to position the company by advancing these productivity initiatives and increasing our strategic investment and generating strong free cash flow. So we believe that it is our innovation and essential focus with our products and services that position us to continue to grow well in the future, certainly at or above the markets we serve. We are very confident in our growth outlook for 2010. We got exceptional visibility of orders in our core markets and we've positive in winning [ph] achievements in our little [ph] cycle businesses. And more importantly, we think we've got the right leaders, strategy and resources in place to generate continued premier performance. We're confident in our ability to deliver 2010 as we've committed. I want to thank you all for joining us and we're off to a good start for the year."

Well, 2010 is definitely off to a great start for ITT. Even beyond some very welcome economic tailwinds, our performance is once again attributable to a focused strategic execution and effective organic growth plan. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share of $0.84 exceeded the prior year by 17% and our prior guidance by $0.10. Of particular pride was the outstanding performance of Motion & Flow Control that delivered a 96 % increase in operating income on a 25% improvement in organic revenue. As a result of improved volume and our relentless pursuit of productivity, Motion's margins improved 500 basis points to 14.2%. This was a truly spectacular quarter for Motion & Flow Control that proved that this segment is capable of delivering very big results after years of restructuring and repositioning.
Significant productivity gains were also delivered by Fluid Technology, driving an operating income increase of 32%. The great results in Fluid and Motion, both are a testimony to the hard work of Gretchen McClain in Munish Nanda and the thousands of Fluid and Motion employees that really bore down in the face of the economic crisis and reset our cost structure.
And likewise, we're very proud of Dave Melcher in the Defense & Information Solutions team who also made great progress during the quarter with the strategic realignment of Defense & Information Solutions. Our three new platforms, Electronic Systems, Geospatial Systems and Information Systems are already lowering their cost structure, leveraging their leading technology and providing integrated solutions to our key customers. And I'm very pleased that our team is nicely ahead of its challenging implementation schedule. 
As a result of these strong Q1 performances, improving conditions in end markets and productivity plans for the balance of the year, we are pleased to raise the midpoint of our 2010 adjusted EPS to $4.13, which now represents a 9% year-over-year growth and which will be a record earnings year for ITT.
We continue to drive new strategic initiatives that will support our future growth. During the quarter, we completed the Nova Analytics acquisition, which add analytical instrumentation to our leading portfolio of Fluid Technologies. This acquisition is on track and we're excited about future growth prospects for this new platform. And lastly, based on our consistent strong free cash flow generation, we announced an 18% dividend increase this quarter, which is our eighth straight annual increase to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4. In this quarter, we also generated some nice wins that reflect the performance of our long-term organic growth strategies. Our strategy is focused on aligning our portfolio with growing global trends such as energy efficiency, freshwater scarcity, global security, aging infrastructure and a mobile network society. In each of these areas, we are identifying innovative ways to leverage ITT's technology to deliver comprehensive solutions. 
In energy, ITT will be developing energy-efficient water system solutions for the city of Chongqing, the largest city in Western China. Chongqing faces severe challenges with 43% of its treatment plant consistently falling below minimum standards. ITT's water treatment technology will provide customized energy-saving solutions that are compatible with Chongqing's unique geography and climate.
In freshwater, ITT will be delivering clean water to Winnipeg to one of the largest dissolved air flotation treatment systems in North America. ITT's system was chosen because of our extensive experience, purifying water in an energy-efficient manner.
in global security, ITT was awarded its second development contract in support of the CREW 3.3 systems design. CREW 3.3 includes dismounted, mounted and fixed site capabilities that provide combat troops protection against radio-controlled explosive devices. And we're announcing this morning that we were just awarded an important CREW 2.1 upgrade program known as Band C, which opens up a very nice follow on opportunity.
In aging infrastructure, ITT will be providing a full suite of treatment equipment to upgrade a water reclamation plant as part of the Chesapeake Bay initiative. ITT's Water & Wastewater business will deliver aeration, filtration and ultraviolet disinfection equipment to help lower nitrogen in the water.
In network society, remember that ITT is already a major partner on the GPS III program, which is supplying the next generation constellation of GPS satellites. And now, ITT will provide critical components and services for the next-generation GPS control program. This program will improve the accuracy, availability and continuity of GPS communication, and it will bring increased situation awareness to the U.S. military users and consumers worldwide.
In total, these strategic wins represent an initial $200 million of new revenue opportunity for ITT. And it should be noted that in each one of these major wins, ITT is delivering integrated system that leverage our leading technology into enduring growing markets with bigger and better solutions for our customers. 
So with that positive outlook underneath our belt for the quarter, let's turn it over to Denise who's going to discuss the specific drivers."
280322,100559853,58793,"ITT Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow",1812,"Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow Control's 25% growth from recent share gains and improving end market conditions. 
In Fluid, organic revenue was flat due to difficult comparison in our late cycle industrial process business that did show signs of recovery during the quarter. In addition, Emerging Markets, which represents more than 21% of our total commercial revenue, grew a solid 9% in the quarter.
Total organic orders declined 5%. Defense organic orders were down 16% due to strong prior year comparisons. However, Motion & Flow grew 32% and Fluid's book-to-bill improved to 1.11 on 3% organic order growth. Segment operating income improved 12%, and margins improved 90 basis points due to 150 basis points of operational productivity that more than offset unfavorable pension and restructuring expenses.
Free cash flow of $25 million was ahead of expectations and in line with our full-year target conversion of 100% of net income. Higher cash taxes and an unfavorable timing of large receivable collections at Defense contributed to the decline compared to the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is strong. We have $880 million of cash and a net debt to net capital ratio of 16.5%, and that does follow the funding of the first quarter Nova acquisition.
Lastly, our adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 17% to $0.84 per share, excluding the net impact of prior year's special tax items and the $0.05 unfavorable impact primarily due to the Healthcare Reform Act's change.
Fluid Technology's first quarter results are in Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 8%. When you exclude favorable foreign exchange and acquisition benefits, organic revenue was flat. We were pleased to see that after four consecutive down quarters, Residential and Commercial Water returned to growth. The business grew 5% organically due to improving residential conditions and restocking in both the residential and commercial building markets. Water & Wastewater declined 1% as strength in dewatering in U.S. municipal transports was offset by European municipal softness. Organic revenue in Industrial Process was down 9% on lower project activity compared to a very strong prior year. 
Fluid operating income grew 32% and operating margins expanded 210 basis points on 190 basis points of operational productivity. These improvements were due to the recent restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that more than offset cost inflation and some negative price. We do expect to see some additional material and foreign exchange pressures as 2010 unfolds, but we are encouraged by the progress we've already made in advancing our productivity initiatives to more than offset these challenges. And as the top line continues to recover, we do expect to see even stronger leverage to operating income.
Fluid organic orders grew 3% in the quarter. It was due to significant improvements at both Residential and Commercial Water and Industrial Process. Our Residential and Commercial orders expanded 15% due to improving residential conditions and commercial building restocking. A 9% improvement in Industrial Process orders was due to improving aftermarket activity and stronger project demand in the international oil and gas, mining and general industrial markets. 
Orders at Water & Wastewater were down 6% due to comparisons to a large prior year project win and some European municipal market softness. Market conditions across most of Fluid appear to be stabilizing or improving. The book-to-bill rate exiting the quarter of 1.11 does reflect some seasonality in restocking, but demand indicators have turned positive in most end markets. However, we are projecting some continued softness in European municipal markets that is largely offsetting gains elsewhere.
On Slide 7, let's take a look at the Nova acquisition, which we announced on February 17. Expansion in the analytical instrumentation has been a focus of ours going back really a couple of years now, and analytical instrumentation is an attractive adjacency for ITT because these technologies provide additional growth opportunities in key markets where ITT already enjoys global leadership position such as water, wastewater, industrial process and food and beverage. We were also attracted to the underlying value drivers in the $6 billion analytical instrumentation market. Like most of our existing markets, analytics is highly fragmented and is driven by enduring needs and stringent regulatory requirements.
Nova Analytics specifically provides ITT with premium global brands, robust distribution and solid aftermarket content. So this acquisition will establish another growth platform for ITT that will provide new opportunities with key customers. For the first time, we will be able to address customers' system needs for fluid transport, treatment and now, testing.
In addition, we plan to significantly expand this business in the emerging markets and the Americas by leveraging ITT's strong relationships and channel. From a financial perspective, Nova's nine month forecasted revenue, approximately $110 million, was minimal 2010 EPS impact and that's due to purchase accounting and integration costs.
So now let's turn to Motion & Flow Control's really exceptional results on Slide 8. All of Motion & Flow Control's business units contributed to the quarter's 25% organic revenue growth. Motion Technologies led the way, with 45% growth on stronger automotive production that was driven by European stimulus program. Motion Tech's recent automotive and rail share gains and global platform wins also contributed nicely to the recent performance. Flow Control improved 28% due to emerging market share gains, some new product launches in the beverage market and restocking in the marine market. Interconnect Solutions grew 10% and that was due to improved conditions in a number of their key end markets.
Motion & Flow Control operating margins improved 500 basis points in total, 440 basis points operationally. So this very strong performance reflects volume, improved mix and the cumulative benefits from two years of aggressive restructuring, realignment and productivity initiatives. Organic orders improved 32% due to big gains at Motion Technologies, Flow Control and Interconnect Solution. We're continuing to take share in the food and beverage market, with improved products and customer-focused execution. We are growing once again in marines and general industrial markets due to improved execution. And we continue to win global platforms in auto and rail due to our strong products, our investments in technology and our customer service.
Motion Technology orders improved 74%. However, we are expecting automotive orders to decelerate beginning in the second quarter due to expiring European stimulus programs. So as a result of our strong performance and the generally positive indicators, we are raising the full year Motion & Flow Control segment's organic revenue forecast from flat to plus 7%.
Defense results in the first quarter are on Slide 9. Organic revenue for Defense declined 4%. Now this was better than our expectation  due to the favorable timing of special-purpose jammer shipments and performance on service contracts. The anticipated decline reflected difficult prior year comparisons for SINCGARS and CREW 2.1. However, these declines were partially offset by a 40% improvement in international revenues. This performance was led by Night Vision, whose first quarter international customers included the U.K., Canada and Denmark. 
Service revenues in the Information Systems business grew 13% due to increased Middle East activities including LOGCAP. Domestic service revenue improved at Fort Benning, Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA next-generation air traffic control program called ADS-B, and we are once again pleased to report that the ADS-B program continues to roll out nicely, with strong cost and scheduled performance indicators to date. 
Productivity continued to be strong, with 60 basis points of operational improvement delivered in the quarter. Higher pension and restructuring expenses more than offset these gains, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Restructuring expenses associated with the defense realignment announced in January were $12 million, and the benefits associated with these actions are already exceeding our aggressive plan.
Q1 organic orders were in line with budget. Compared to the prior year, orders declined 16% due to $400 million of CREW 2.1 and U.S. Night Vision orders in the first quarter of 2009. Orders for Information Systems improved 32% compared to the prior year due to ADS-B awards, important re-compete wins and new program activity. International Night Vision orders were strong and we've recently invested in expanding sales capabilities in growing markets such as India and Australia.
Other significant Q1 orders included $129 million in airborne countermeasures and $50 million for SINCGARS in Saudi Arabia. And just a couple of days ago, as Steve mentioned, we were awarded an important contract for 436 Band C upgrades to CREW 2.1. Defense backlog at the end of the quarter was $5 billion and it was in line with our full year 2010 forecast of $5 billion.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and we'll talk about the revised 2010 EPS guidance. The new 2010 adjusted EPS guidance reflects our strong Q1 results, increased confidence in our commercial productivity plans and stabilizing end market conditions for the balance of the year. So we are increasing our operational EPS before nonoperating items by $0.18 per share. We are now projecting $0.05 of incremental nonoperating headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange and higher dilutions in stock option, net of a lower effective tax rate. So in total, our 2010 adjusted EPS range is now $4.05 to $4.20 per share, and at the midpoint, this represents 9% growth from 2009 and a 2% improvement over pre-economic downturn results in the first quarter of 2008.
On Slide 11, we've provided our Q2 and detailed 2010 outlook. So for the second quarter, we are projecting flat EPS in the $1.05 to $1.07 range. And this forecast does include $0.02 of net dilution from the Nova acquisition, which is driven by purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. Q2 revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year. Organic revenues compared to the prior year are expected to be down 2% due to a 3% decline at Defense. But on a sequential basis, ITT organic revenue is projected to improve 5% in the second quarter. 
For the full year, Defense revenue guidance was adjusted to 3% based on revised timing of orders and customer fielding plans. We increased total Fluid revenue to 5% from 2% to reflect the Nova acquisition. In total, revenue for Motion & Flow Control was increased to 6% and organic revenue was increased to 7% from flat in the prior guidance. So ITT's 2010 revenue is now expected to grow 4%. Organic revenue guidance was increased to 3% from 2%. Segment operating margin guidance was increased 10 basis points from the prior guidance to 12.3% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions.
So with that, let me now turn things over to Tom to begin the Q&A."

Monday, I'm actually going to go visit our two major sites over in Europe to take a closer look and meet with Chris McIntyre and the new team. So the strategy is exactly as you outlined, Nigel. This has a high level of relatedness to Fluid Technology. And so it is through the Fluid Technology lens that we can grow the Nova Analytics product line, particularly in emerging markets and through our adjacent sales and marketing distribution capabilities. But having said that, you can take these same technologies and expand into other segments such as Life Sciences and Healthcare. And so when we talk about ITT analytics as a new platform, while we will be growing initially through the lens of Fluid Tech, we fully anticipate to be able to expand into other segments. And so I think it's a really nice way to grow a new platform in areas in Beverage, Healthcare, Life Sciences, Environmental Testing and Monitoring and so forth. So yes, we fully intend to openly growing out that area. And keep in mind that Nova Analytics already has about 40% of their business outside of water. They're in Food and Beverage.

And we're working with them, obviously, on the development of the engineering suite of products and technology that meet their needs. So local partnerships are really an important part of the way we go to market.

We're seeing a cautious recovery in the United States for reasons of confidence and so forth that we're all aware of. So something on the order of two or maybe two plus in the United States. Europe is actually recovering a little bit lower and a little bit slower. There's obviously current day concerns, with respect to some of the credit issues we're all reading about. On the flip side, we're seeing substantial growth in the emerging markets, most notably Brazil, couple of the economies in the GCC, certainly India and China. Our team just returned from a fairly expensive series of trips in the Middle East, China and India. And one of my observations on that, Nicole, was that while these economies slowed down as an example, China was quoted to slow down from 9% to the 7% range. The fact is, there is an unstoppable transition from lower class to middle class, unstoppable population growth. And in these economies, you're just seeing a continued very, very strong demand. They're going to be tripling their power generation capacity in India over the next five years. It is a phenomenal amount of infrastructure that's being put in. And I think everyone knows the Chinese numbers where we're going to have, in the next 15 years, we're going to increase the middle class population in China to a number, which is in excess of the amount of people that actually live in the United States, over 350 million people. So these dynamics -- I mean, having been there real time over the past month, these dynamics are giving us a great deal of confidence in some of these emerging markets. So that's our summary. I think that the only concern is ultimately going to be the flow of money and the efficiency of these capital markets."

We're going to finish the year in the $5 billion backlog range. Based on our ambitions now and the, sort of, certainty around our probabilistic weighted contract wins, we think that we'll see another year in defense in the 2011 timeframe. That's in the same range as what we're seeing this year.
And now before we close, I guess I'll just take this opportunity to offer an overarching thought, just somewhat consistent or somewhat as a follow-on to Nicole's question. And it's really all about our growth strategy and where we find ourself in this journey through this economic recovery. I think to begin with, our performance this quarter validates the fact that we do have a razillion [ph] portfolio. Thanks to some of the diversification and really put our investments. I'm going to try to frame that for you. Over the past several years, we've really aggressively repositioned this portfolio to better address these growing global trends, such as global safety and mobile network society and water scarcity. And we've also been working for several years to offset these anticipated declines in some of these core arm services budgets that we understand, I think you all understand, are creating a significant headwind for us this year.
Notwithstanding those headwinds on the Defense budget, if you, sort of, take out these major core arm service budget changes, the balance of our Defense business is actually growing in the 9%, 10% range. So what you can see is that this company was a company that performed well in the economic downturn. In fact, our earnings and revenue growth numbers were among the best in our peer group. So I think it's safe to conclude that this strategy is working for us. And just to reflect that our current earnings guidance will represent a record EPS for the company, which will be a 2% increase over 2008. So we like our strategic position. 
A couple of really specific reasons why we like it. Since 2007, we have invested $1.2 billion in our highest growth commercial opportunities. That investment include $875 million for strategic acquisitions, most notably the IMC, Lang [ph] and Nova acquisitions. We've invested an additional $250 million for restructuring and realignment of our activities, and an incremental $105 million for organic growth investments to stimulate our global marketing capacity and new product technology. And on top of all that, we have invested a very substantial amount of capital to build 11 world class new facilities in China, India, Saudi Arabia, Poland, Mexico and the Czech Republic.
So despite the headwinds of the short cycle economic downturn, we are thrilled and believe very strongly that these investments on the commercial side of the business have very solidly positioned us to grow in these vital markets. At the same time, thanks to Dave Melcher in the Defense and Information team, we have been expanding our technologies and capabilities to penetrate these growing non-arm services opportunities such as NASA, the FAA, the Homeland Security, commercial market and international markets. And what has been somewhat invisible to all of you, because these have been program by program wins, is that this strategy we have communicated to you today, with a number of significant long term wins, have driven our non-arm services revenue to over $1.5 billion, representing 25% of the Defense & Information Solutions revenue. And so if you go back to, kind of, characterize where we were since 2006, our cumulative annual growth rate in this non-arm services category has been 25%. So this defense adjacency strategy that we've been communicating has really, really worked well. And despite these potential pressures in the core arm services activities, again, in the Defense and the broader Information Solutions business, we believe we're very, very well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth.
So that, coupled with the fact that we will continue to see strong free cash flow generation even with all these investments and portfolio changes, gives us confidence that we've got an engineer that drives the cycle of reinvestment and strong strategic and financial opportunities to develop this capital. So we feel good about where we are. And I just wanted to conclude with this sort of longer term overarching view of this portfolio. We not only are performing well, but we've been investing significantly to reposition in the right markets and right technologies. And we've been doing a nice job of diversification.
So with that, I will conclude with my pleasure on the progress we've been made. And thank you all for your interest in ITT. We'll talk with you next time."

Well, 2010 is definitely off to a great start for ITT. Even beyond some very welcome economic tailwinds, our performance is once again attributable to a focused strategic execution and effective organic growth plan. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share of $0.84 exceeded the prior year by 17% and our prior guidance by $0.10. Of particular pride was the outstanding performance of Motion & Flow Control that delivered a 96 % increase in operating income on a 25% improvement in organic revenue. As a result of improved volume and our relentless pursuit of productivity, Motion's margins improved 500 basis points to 14.2%. This was a truly spectacular quarter for Motion & Flow Control that proved that this segment is capable of delivering very big results after years of restructuring and repositioning.
Significant productivity gains were also delivered by Fluid Technology, driving an operating income increase of 32%. The great results in Fluid and Motion, both are a testimony to the hard work of Gretchen McClain in Munish Nanda and the thousands of Fluid and Motion employees that really bore down in the face of the economic crisis and reset our cost structure.
And likewise, we're very proud of Dave Melcher in the Defense & Information Solutions team who also made great progress during the quarter with the strategic realignment of Defense & Information Solutions. Our three new platforms, Electronic Systems, Geospatial Systems and Information Systems are already lowering their cost structure, leveraging their leading technology and providing integrated solutions to our key customers. And I'm very pleased that our team is nicely ahead of its challenging implementation schedule. 
As a result of these strong Q1 performances, improving conditions in end markets and productivity plans for the balance of the year, we are pleased to raise the midpoint of our 2010 adjusted EPS to $4.13, which now represents a 9% year-over-year growth and which will be a record earnings year for ITT.
We continue to drive new strategic initiatives that will support our future growth. During the quarter, we completed the Nova Analytics acquisition, which add analytical instrumentation to our leading portfolio of Fluid Technologies. This acquisition is on track and we're excited about future growth prospects for this new platform. And lastly, based on our consistent strong free cash flow generation, we announced an 18% dividend increase this quarter, which is our eighth straight annual increase to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4. In this quarter, we also generated some nice wins that reflect the performance of our long-term organic growth strategies. Our strategy is focused on aligning our portfolio with growing global trends such as energy efficiency, freshwater scarcity, global security, aging infrastructure and a mobile network society. In each of these areas, we are identifying innovative ways to leverage ITT's technology to deliver comprehensive solutions. 
In energy, ITT will be developing energy-efficient water system solutions for the city of Chongqing, the largest city in Western China. Chongqing faces severe challenges with 43% of its treatment plant consistently falling below minimum standards. ITT's water treatment technology will provide customized energy-saving solutions that are compatible with Chongqing's unique geography and climate.
In freshwater, ITT will be delivering clean water to Winnipeg to one of the largest dissolved air flotation treatment systems in North America. ITT's system was chosen because of our extensive experience, purifying water in an energy-efficient manner.
in global security, ITT was awarded its second development contract in support of the CREW 3.3 systems design. CREW 3.3 includes dismounted, mounted and fixed site capabilities that provide combat troops protection against radio-controlled explosive devices. And we're announcing this morning that we were just awarded an important CREW 2.1 upgrade program known as Band C, which opens up a very nice follow on opportunity.
In aging infrastructure, ITT will be providing a full suite of treatment equipment to upgrade a water reclamation plant as part of the Chesapeake Bay initiative. ITT's Water & Wastewater business will deliver aeration, filtration and ultraviolet disinfection equipment to help lower nitrogen in the water.
In network society, remember that ITT is already a major partner on the GPS III program, which is supplying the next generation constellation of GPS satellites. And now, ITT will provide critical components and services for the next-generation GPS control program. This program will improve the accuracy, availability and continuity of GPS communication, and it will bring increased situation awareness to the U.S. military users and consumers worldwide.
In total, these strategic wins represent an initial $200 million of new revenue opportunity for ITT. And it should be noted that in each one of these major wins, ITT is delivering integrated system that leverage our leading technology into enduring growing markets with bigger and better solutions for our customers. 
So with that positive outlook underneath our belt for the quarter, let's turn it over to Denise who's going to discuss the specific drivers.
"
280322,100559853,58799,"ITT Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow",1812,"Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow Control's 25% growth from recent share gains and improving end market conditions. 
In Fluid, organic revenue was flat due to difficult comparison in our late cycle industrial process business that did show signs of recovery during the quarter. In addition, Emerging Markets, which represents more than 21% of our total commercial revenue, grew a solid 9% in the quarter.
Total organic orders declined 5%. Defense organic orders were down 16% due to strong prior year comparisons. However, Motion & Flow grew 32% and Fluid's book-to-bill improved to 1.11 on 3% organic order growth. Segment operating income improved 12%, and margins improved 90 basis points due to 150 basis points of operational productivity that more than offset unfavorable pension and restructuring expenses.
Free cash flow of $25 million was ahead of expectations and in line with our full-year target conversion of 100% of net income. Higher cash taxes and an unfavorable timing of large receivable collections at Defense contributed to the decline compared to the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is strong. We have $880 million of cash and a net debt to net capital ratio of 16.5%, and that does follow the funding of the first quarter Nova acquisition.
Lastly, our adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 17% to $0.84 per share, excluding the net impact of prior year's special tax items and the $0.05 unfavorable impact primarily due to the Healthcare Reform Act's change.
Fluid Technology's first quarter results are in Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 8%. When you exclude favorable foreign exchange and acquisition benefits, organic revenue was flat. We were pleased to see that after four consecutive down quarters, Residential and Commercial Water returned to growth. The business grew 5% organically due to improving residential conditions and restocking in both the residential and commercial building markets. Water & Wastewater declined 1% as strength in dewatering in U.S. municipal transports was offset by European municipal softness. Organic revenue in Industrial Process was down 9% on lower project activity compared to a very strong prior year. 
Fluid operating income grew 32% and operating margins expanded 210 basis points on 190 basis points of operational productivity. These improvements were due to the recent restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that more than offset cost inflation and some negative price. We do expect to see some additional material and foreign exchange pressures as 2010 unfolds, but we are encouraged by the progress we've already made in advancing our productivity initiatives to more than offset these challenges. And as the top line continues to recover, we do expect to see even stronger leverage to operating income.
Fluid organic orders grew 3% in the quarter. It was due to significant improvements at both Residential and Commercial Water and Industrial Process. Our Residential and Commercial orders expanded 15% due to improving residential conditions and commercial building restocking. A 9% improvement in Industrial Process orders was due to improving aftermarket activity and stronger project demand in the international oil and gas, mining and general industrial markets. 
Orders at Water & Wastewater were down 6% due to comparisons to a large prior year project win and some European municipal market softness. Market conditions across most of Fluid appear to be stabilizing or improving. The book-to-bill rate exiting the quarter of 1.11 does reflect some seasonality in restocking, but demand indicators have turned positive in most end markets. However, we are projecting some continued softness in European municipal markets that is largely offsetting gains elsewhere.
On Slide 7, let's take a look at the Nova acquisition, which we announced on February 17. Expansion in the analytical instrumentation has been a focus of ours going back really a couple of years now, and analytical instrumentation is an attractive adjacency for ITT because these technologies provide additional growth opportunities in key markets where ITT already enjoys global leadership position such as water, wastewater, industrial process and food and beverage. We were also attracted to the underlying value drivers in the $6 billion analytical instrumentation market. Like most of our existing markets, analytics is highly fragmented and is driven by enduring needs and stringent regulatory requirements.
Nova Analytics specifically provides ITT with premium global brands, robust distribution and solid aftermarket content. So this acquisition will establish another growth platform for ITT that will provide new opportunities with key customers. For the first time, we will be able to address customers' system needs for fluid transport, treatment and now, testing.
In addition, we plan to significantly expand this business in the emerging markets and the Americas by leveraging ITT's strong relationships and channel. From a financial perspective, Nova's nine month forecasted revenue, approximately $110 million, was minimal 2010 EPS impact and that's due to purchase accounting and integration costs.
So now let's turn to Motion & Flow Control's really exceptional results on Slide 8. All of Motion & Flow Control's business units contributed to the quarter's 25% organic revenue growth. Motion Technologies led the way, with 45% growth on stronger automotive production that was driven by European stimulus program. Motion Tech's recent automotive and rail share gains and global platform wins also contributed nicely to the recent performance. Flow Control improved 28% due to emerging market share gains, some new product launches in the beverage market and restocking in the marine market. Interconnect Solutions grew 10% and that was due to improved conditions in a number of their key end markets.
Motion & Flow Control operating margins improved 500 basis points in total, 440 basis points operationally. So this very strong performance reflects volume, improved mix and the cumulative benefits from two years of aggressive restructuring, realignment and productivity initiatives. Organic orders improved 32% due to big gains at Motion Technologies, Flow Control and Interconnect Solution. We're continuing to take share in the food and beverage market, with improved products and customer-focused execution. We are growing once again in marines and general industrial markets due to improved execution. And we continue to win global platforms in auto and rail due to our strong products, our investments in technology and our customer service.
Motion Technology orders improved 74%. However, we are expecting automotive orders to decelerate beginning in the second quarter due to expiring European stimulus programs. So as a result of our strong performance and the generally positive indicators, we are raising the full year Motion & Flow Control segment's organic revenue forecast from flat to plus 7%.
Defense results in the first quarter are on Slide 9. Organic revenue for Defense declined 4%. Now this was better than our expectation  due to the favorable timing of special-purpose jammer shipments and performance on service contracts. The anticipated decline reflected difficult prior year comparisons for SINCGARS and CREW 2.1. However, these declines were partially offset by a 40% improvement in international revenues. This performance was led by Night Vision, whose first quarter international customers included the U.K., Canada and Denmark. 
Service revenues in the Information Systems business grew 13% due to increased Middle East activities including LOGCAP. Domestic service revenue improved at Fort Benning, Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA next-generation air traffic control program called ADS-B, and we are once again pleased to report that the ADS-B program continues to roll out nicely, with strong cost and scheduled performance indicators to date. 
Productivity continued to be strong, with 60 basis points of operational improvement delivered in the quarter. Higher pension and restructuring expenses more than offset these gains, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Restructuring expenses associated with the defense realignment announced in January were $12 million, and the benefits associated with these actions are already exceeding our aggressive plan.
Q1 organic orders were in line with budget. Compared to the prior year, orders declined 16% due to $400 million of CREW 2.1 and U.S. Night Vision orders in the first quarter of 2009. Orders for Information Systems improved 32% compared to the prior year due to ADS-B awards, important re-compete wins and new program activity. International Night Vision orders were strong and we've recently invested in expanding sales capabilities in growing markets such as India and Australia.
Other significant Q1 orders included $129 million in airborne countermeasures and $50 million for SINCGARS in Saudi Arabia. And just a couple of days ago, as Steve mentioned, we were awarded an important contract for 436 Band C upgrades to CREW 2.1. Defense backlog at the end of the quarter was $5 billion and it was in line with our full year 2010 forecast of $5 billion.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and we'll talk about the revised 2010 EPS guidance. The new 2010 adjusted EPS guidance reflects our strong Q1 results, increased confidence in our commercial productivity plans and stabilizing end market conditions for the balance of the year. So we are increasing our operational EPS before nonoperating items by $0.18 per share. We are now projecting $0.05 of incremental nonoperating headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange and higher dilutions in stock option, net of a lower effective tax rate. So in total, our 2010 adjusted EPS range is now $4.05 to $4.20 per share, and at the midpoint, this represents 9% growth from 2009 and a 2% improvement over pre-economic downturn results in the first quarter of 2008.
On Slide 11, we've provided our Q2 and detailed 2010 outlook. So for the second quarter, we are projecting flat EPS in the $1.05 to $1.07 range. And this forecast does include $0.02 of net dilution from the Nova acquisition, which is driven by purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. Q2 revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year. Organic revenues compared to the prior year are expected to be down 2% due to a 3% decline at Defense. But on a sequential basis, ITT organic revenue is projected to improve 5% in the second quarter. 
For the full year, Defense revenue guidance was adjusted to 3% based on revised timing of orders and customer fielding plans. We increased total Fluid revenue to 5% from 2% to reflect the Nova acquisition. In total, revenue for Motion & Flow Control was increased to 6% and organic revenue was increased to 7% from flat in the prior guidance. So ITT's 2010 revenue is now expected to grow 4%. Organic revenue guidance was increased to 3% from 2%. Segment operating margin guidance was increased 10 basis points from the prior guidance to 12.3% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions.
So with that, let me now turn things over to Tom to begin the Q&A.

And as I mentioned in some of the activities around industrial, dewatering and in other global Fluid Technology segments, we continue to feel pretty active about that. That's principally our pipeline.

Again, we're looking at probably a slightly lower number. We're in the 2.5 kind of x with most of these multiples. But there's no question that even in this economy to make these acquisitions work, we need to find the right level of sales and cost synergies. This is why staying pretty close, in terms of related in a standpoint from our portfolio is good because we do have, as an example, in Fluid Technology, a fabulous global distribution architecture, in terms of sales/marketing/engineering. And when we buy these companies like Nova Analytics, we're able to flow. And I could say the same thing with Leopold and several other acquisitions. We're able to flow these technologies through our pre-existing channels. So as a consequence, we actually have a very nice tool in our box with respect to Fluid Technology to achieve these synergies. And then on the cost side, of course, anything we can do to streamline the internal cost or things that we go after. And quite frankly, by the time we assess the conservative level of synergies and cost, we're able to make these acquisitions work.

And quite frankly, everything that we've seen so far is positive. Monday, I'm actually going to go visit our two major sites over in Europe to take a closer look and meet with Chris McIntyre and the new team. So the strategy is exactly as you outlined, Nigel. This has a high level of relatedness to Fluid Technology. And so it is through the Fluid Technology lens that we can grow the Nova Analytics product line, particularly in emerging markets and through our adjacent sales and marketing distribution capabilities. But having said that, you can take these same technologies and expand into other segments such as Life Sciences and Healthcare. And so when we talk about ITT analytics as a new platform, while we will be growing initially through the lens of Fluid Tech, we fully anticipate to be able to expand into other segments. And so I think it's a really nice way to grow a new platform in areas in Beverage, Healthcare, Life Sciences, Environmental Testing and Monitoring and so forth. So yes, we fully intend to openly growing out that area. And keep in mind that Nova Analytics already has about 40% of their business outside of water. They're in Food and Beverage. They're in Pharmaceutical and so forth. So both organically and inorganically, we should be able to achieve that vision and build on that platform.

On the flip side, we're seeing substantial growth in the emerging markets, most notably Brazil, couple of the economies in the GCC, certainly India and China. Our team just returned from a fairly expensive series of trips in the Middle East, China and India. And one of my observations on that, Nicole, was that while these economies slowed down as an example, China was quoted to slow down from 9% to the 7% range. The fact is, there is an unstoppable transition from lower class to middle class, unstoppable population growth. And in these economies, you're just seeing a continued very, very strong demand. They're going to be tripling their power generation capacity in India over the next five years. It is a phenomenal amount of infrastructure that's being put in. And I think everyone knows the Chinese numbers where we're going to have, in the next 15 years, we're going to increase the middle class population in China to a number, which is in excess of the amount of people that actually live in the United States, over 350 million people. So these dynamics -- I mean, having been there real time over the past month, these dynamics are giving us a great deal of confidence in some of these emerging markets. So that's our summary.

We're going to finish the year in the $5 billion backlog range. Based on our ambitions now and the, sort of, certainty around our probabilistic weighted contract wins, we think that we'll see another year in defense in the 2011 timefr",774,"Yes, we're on track. We're going to finish the year in the $5 billion backlog range. Based on our ambitions now and the, sort of, certainty around our probabilistic weighted contract wins, we think that we'll see another year in defense in the 2011 timeframe. That's in the same range as what we're seeing this year.
And now before we close, I guess I'll just take this opportunity to offer an overarching thought, just somewhat consistent or somewhat as a follow-on to Nicole's question. And it's really all about our growth strategy and where we find ourself in this journey through this economic recovery. I think to begin with, our performance this quarter validates the fact that we do have a razillion [ph] portfolio. Thanks to some of the diversification and really put our investments. I'm going to try to frame that for you. Over the past several years, we've really aggressively repositioned this portfolio to better address these growing global trends, such as global safety and mobile network society and water scarcity. And we've also been working for several years to offset these anticipated declines in some of these core arm services budgets that we understand, I think you all understand, are creating a significant headwind for us this year.
Notwithstanding those headwinds on the Defense budget, if you, sort of, take out these major core arm service budget changes, the balance of our Defense business is actually growing in the 9%, 10% range. So what you can see is that this company was a company that performed well in the economic downturn. In fact, our earnings and revenue growth numbers were among the best in our peer group. So I think it's safe to conclude that this strategy is working for us. And just to reflect that our current earnings guidance will represent a record EPS for the company, which will be a 2% increase over 2008. So we like our strategic position. 
A couple of really specific reasons why we like it. Since 2007, we have invested $1.2 billion in our highest growth commercial opportunities. That investment include $875 million for strategic acquisitions, most notably the IMC, Lang [ph] and Nova acquisitions. We've invested an additional $250 million for restructuring and realignment of our activities, and an incremental $105 million for organic growth investments to stimulate our global marketing capacity and new product technology. And on top of all that, we have invested a very substantial amount of capital to build 11 world class new facilities in China, India, Saudi Arabia, Poland, Mexico and the Czech Republic.
So despite the headwinds of the short cycle economic downturn, we are thrilled and believe very strongly that these investments on the commercial side of the business have very solidly positioned us to grow in these vital markets. At the same time, thanks to Dave Melcher in the Defense and Information team, we have been expanding our technologies and capabilities to penetrate these growing non-arm services opportunities such as NASA, the FAA, the Homeland Security, commercial market and international markets. And what has been somewhat invisible to all of you, because these have been program by program wins, is that this strategy we have communicated to you today, with a number of significant long term wins, have driven our non-arm services revenue to over $1.5 billion, representing 25% of the Defense & Information Solutions revenue. And so if you go back to, kind of, characterize where we were since 2006, our cumulative annual growth rate in this non-arm services category has been 25%. So this defense adjacency strategy that we've been communicating has really, really worked well. And despite these potential pressures in the core arm services activities, again, in the Defense and the broader Information Solutions business, we believe we're very, very well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth.
So that, coupled with the fact that we will continue to see strong free cash flow generation even with all these investments and portfolio changes, gives us confidence that we've got an engineer that drives the cycle of reinvestment and strong strategic and financial opportunities to develop this capital. So we feel good about where we are. And I just wanted to conclude with this sort of longer term overarching view of this portfolio. We not only are performing well, but we've been investing significantly to reposition in the right markets and right technologies. And we've been doing a nice job of diversification.
So with that, I will conclude with my pleasure on the progress we've been made. And thank you all for your interest in ITT. We'll talk with you next time.

Well, 2010 is definitely off to a great start for ITT. Even beyond some very welcome economic tailwinds, our performance is once again attributable to a focused strategic execution and effective organic growth plan. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share of $0.84 exceeded the prior year by 17% and our prior guidance by $0.10. Of particular pride was the outstanding performance of Motion & Flow Control that delivered a 96 % increase in operating income on a 25% improvement in organic revenue. As a result of improved volume and our relentless pursuit of productivity, Motion's margins improved 500 basis points to 14.2%. This was a truly spectacular quarter for Motion & Flow Control that proved that this segment is capable of delivering very big results after years of restructuring and repositioning.
Significant productivity gains were also delivered by Fluid Technology, driving an operating income increase of 32%. The great results in Fluid and Motion, both are a testimony to the hard work of Gretchen McClain in Munish Nanda and the thousands of Fluid and Motion employees that really bore down in the face of the economic crisis and reset our cost structure.
And likewise, we're very proud of Dave Melcher in the Defense & Information Solutions team who also made great progress during the quarter with the strategic realignment of Defense & Information Solutions. Our three new platforms, Electronic Systems, Geospatial Systems and Information Systems are already lowering their cost structure, leveraging their leading technology and providing integrated solutions to our key customers. And I'm very pleased that our team is nicely ahead of its challenging implementation schedule. 
As a result of these strong Q1 performances, improving conditions in end markets and productivity plans for the balance of the year, we are pleased to raise the midpoint of our 2010 adjusted EPS to $4.13, which now represents a 9% year-over-year growth and which will be a record earnings year for ITT.
We continue to drive new strategic initiatives that will support our future growth. During the quarter, we completed the Nova Analytics acquisition, which add analytical instrumentation to our leading portfolio of Fluid Technologies. This acquisition is on track and we're excited about future growth prospects for this new platform. And lastly, based on our consistent strong free cash flow generation, we announced an 18% dividend increase this quarter, which is our eighth straight annual increase to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4. In this quarter, we also generated some nice wins that reflect the performance of our long-term organic growth strategies. Our strategy is focused on aligning our portfolio with growing global trends such as energy efficiency, freshwater scarcity, global security, aging infrastructure and a mobile network society. In each of these areas, we are identifying innovative ways to leverage ITT's technology to deliver comprehensive solutions. 
In energy, ITT will be developing energy-efficient water system solutions for the city of Chongqing, the largest city in Western China. Chongqing faces severe challenges with 43% of its treatment plant consistently falling below minimum standards. ITT's water treatment technology will provide customized energy-saving solutions that are compatible with Chongqing's unique geography and climate.
In freshwater, ITT will be delivering clean water to Winnipeg to one of the largest dissolved air flotation treatment systems in North America. ITT's system was chosen because of our extensive experience, purifying water in an energy-efficient manner.
in global security, ITT was awarded its second development contract in support of the CREW 3.3 systems design. CREW 3.3 includes dismounted, mounted and fixed site capabilities that provide combat troops protection against radio-controlled explosive devices. And we're announcing this morning that we were just awarded an important CREW 2.1 upgrade program known as Band C, which opens up a very nice follow on opportunity.
In aging infrastructure, ITT will be providing a full suite of treatment equipment to upgrade a water reclamation plant as part of the Chesapeake Bay initiative. ITT's Water & Wastewater business will deliver aeration, filtration and ultraviolet disinfection equipment to help lower nitrogen in the water.
In network society, remember that ITT is already a major partner on the GPS III program, which is supplying the next generation constellation of GPS satellites. And now, ITT will provide critical components and services for the next-generation GPS control program. This program will improve the accuracy, availability and continuity of GPS communication, and it will bring increased situation awareness to the U.S. military users and consumers worldwide.
In total, these strategic wins represent an initial $200 million of new revenue opportunity for ITT. And it should be noted that in each one of these major wins, ITT is delivering integrated system that leverage our leading technology into enduring growing markets with bigger and better solutions for our customers. 
So with that positive outlook underneath our belt for the quarter, let's turn it over to Denise who's going to discuss the specific drivers."
280322,100559853,67575,"ITT Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow",1811,"Thanks, Steve. So on Slide 5, you'll see that first quarter 2010 revenues improved 3%. Now when you exclude the positive benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions, our organic revenue improved 1%. The quarter's performance was driven by Motion & Flow Control's 25% growth from recent share gains and improving end market conditions. 
In Fluid, organic revenue was flat due to difficult comparison in our late cycle industrial process business that did show signs of recovery during the quarter. In addition, Emerging Markets, which represents more than 21% of our total commercial revenue, grew a solid 9% in the quarter.
Total organic orders declined 5%. Defense organic orders were down 16% due to strong prior year comparisons. However, Motion & Flow grew 32% and Fluid's book-to-bill improved to 1.11 on 3% organic order growth. Segment operating income improved 12%, and margins improved 90 basis points due to 150 basis points of operational productivity that more than offset unfavorable pension and restructuring expenses.
Free cash flow of $25 million was ahead of expectations and in line with our full-year target conversion of 100% of net income. Higher cash taxes and an unfavorable timing of large receivable collections at Defense contributed to the decline compared to the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is strong. We have $880 million of cash and a net debt to net capital ratio of 16.5%, and that does follow the funding of the first quarter Nova acquisition.
Lastly, our adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 17% to $0.84 per share, excluding the net impact of prior year's special tax items and the $0.05 unfavorable impact primarily due to the Healthcare Reform Act's change.
Fluid Technology's first quarter results are in Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 8%. When you exclude favorable foreign exchange and acquisition benefits, organic revenue was flat. We were pleased to see that after four consecutive down quarters, Residential and Commercial Water returned to growth. The business grew 5% organically due to improving residential conditions and restocking in both the residential and commercial building markets. Water & Wastewater declined 1% as strength in dewatering in U.S. municipal transports was offset by European municipal softness. Organic revenue in Industrial Process was down 9% on lower project activity compared to a very strong prior year. 
Fluid operating income grew 32% and operating margins expanded 210 basis points on 190 basis points of operational productivity. These improvements were due to the recent restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that more than offset cost inflation and some negative price. We do expect to see some additional material and foreign exchange pressures as 2010 unfolds, but we are encouraged by the progress we've already made in advancing our productivity initiatives to more than offset these challenges. And as the top line continues to recover, we do expect to see even stronger leverage to operating income.
Fluid organic orders grew 3% in the quarter. It was due to significant improvements at both Residential and Commercial Water and Industrial Process. Our Residential and Commercial orders expanded 15% due to improving residential conditions and commercial building restocking. A 9% improvement in Industrial Process orders was due to improving aftermarket activity and stronger project demand in the international oil and gas, mining and general industrial markets. 
Orders at Water & Wastewater were down 6% due to comparisons to a large prior year project win and some European municipal market softness. Market conditions across most of Fluid appear to be stabilizing or improving. The book-to-bill rate exiting the quarter of 1.11 does reflect some seasonality in restocking, but demand indicators have turned positive in most end markets. However, we are projecting some continued softness in European municipal markets that is largely offsetting gains elsewhere.
On Slide 7, let's take a look at the Nova acquisition, which we announced on February 17. Expansion in the analytical instrumentation has been a focus of ours going back really a couple of years now, and analytical instrumentation is an attractive adjacency for ITT because these technologies provide additional growth opportunities in key markets where ITT already enjoys global leadership position such as water, wastewater, industrial process and food and beverage. We were also attracted to the underlying value drivers in the $6 billion analytical instrumentation market. Like most of our existing markets, analytics is highly fragmented and is driven by enduring needs and stringent regulatory requirements.
Nova Analytics specifically provides ITT with premium global brands, robust distribution and solid aftermarket content. So this acquisition will establish another growth platform for ITT that will provide new opportunities with key customers. For the first time, we will be able to address customers' system needs for fluid transport, treatment and now, testing.
In addition, we plan to significantly expand this business in the emerging markets and the Americas by leveraging ITT's strong relationships and channel. From a financial perspective, Nova's nine month forecasted revenue, approximately $110 million, was minimal 2010 EPS impact and that's due to purchase accounting and integration costs.
So now let's turn to Motion & Flow Control's really exceptional results on Slide 8. All of Motion & Flow Control's business units contributed to the quarter's 25% organic revenue growth. Motion Technologies led the way, with 45% growth on stronger automotive production that was driven by European stimulus program. Motion Tech's recent automotive and rail share gains and global platform wins also contributed nicely to the recent performance. Flow Control improved 28% due to emerging market share gains, some new product launches in the beverage market and restocking in the marine market. Interconnect Solutions grew 10% and that was due to improved conditions in a number of their key end markets.
Motion & Flow Control operating margins improved 500 basis points in total, 440 basis points operationally. So this very strong performance reflects volume, improved mix and the cumulative benefits from two years of aggressive restructuring, realignment and productivity initiatives. Organic orders improved 32% due to big gains at Motion Technologies, Flow Control and Interconnect Solution. We're continuing to take share in the food and beverage market, with improved products and customer-focused execution. We are growing once again in marines and general industrial markets due to improved execution. And we continue to win global platforms in auto and rail due to our strong products, our investments in technology and our customer service.
Motion Technology orders improved 74%. However, we are expecting automotive orders to decelerate beginning in the second quarter due to expiring European stimulus programs. So as a result of our strong performance and the generally positive indicators, we are raising the full year Motion & Flow Control segment's organic revenue forecast from flat to plus 7%.
Defense results in the first quarter are on Slide 9. Organic revenue for Defense declined 4%. Now this was better than our expectation  due to the favorable timing of special-purpose jammer shipments and performance on service contracts. The anticipated decline reflected difficult prior year comparisons for SINCGARS and CREW 2.1. However, these declines were partially offset by a 40% improvement in international revenues. This performance was led by Night Vision, whose first quarter international customers included the U.K., Canada and Denmark. 
Service revenues in the Information Systems business grew 13% due to increased Middle East activities including LOGCAP. Domestic service revenue improved at Fort Benning, Maxwell Air Force Base and the FAA next-generation air traffic control program called ADS-B, and we are once again pleased to report that the ADS-B program continues to roll out nicely with strong cost and scheduled performance indicators to date. 
Productivity continued to be strong, with 60 basis points of operational improvement delivered in the quarter. Higher pension and restructuring expenses more than offset these gains, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Restructuring expenses associated with the defense realignment announced in January were $12 million, and the benefits associated with these actions are already exceeding our aggressive plan.
Q1 organic orders were in line with budget. Compared to the prior year, orders declined 16% due to $400 million of CREW 2.1 and U.S. Night Vision orders in the first quarter of 2009. Orders for Information Systems improved 32% compared to the prior year due to ADS-B awards, important re-compete wins and new program activity. International Night Vision orders were strong and we've recently invested in expanding sales capabilities in growing markets such as India and Australia.
Other significant Q1 orders included $129 million in airborne countermeasures and $50 million for SINCGARS in Saudi Arabia. And just a couple days ago, as Steve mentioned, we were awarded an important contract for 436 Band C upgrades to CREW 2.1. Defense backlog at the end of the quarter was $5 billion and it was in line with our full year 2010 forecast of $5 billion.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and we'll talk about the revised 2010 EPS guidance. The new 2010 adjusted EPS guidance reflects our strong Q1 results, increased confidence in our commercial productivity plans and stabilizing end market conditions for the balance of the year. So we are increasing our operational EPS before non-operating items by $0.18 per share. We are now projecting $0.05 of incremental non-operating headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange and higher dilutions in stock option, net of a lower effective tax rate. So in total, our 2010 adjusted EPS range is now $4.05 to $4.20 per share, and at the midpoint, this represents 9% growth from 2009 and a 2% improvement over pre-economic downturn results in the first quarter of 2008.
On Slide 11, we've provided our Q2 and detailed 2010 outlook. So for the second quarter, we are projecting flat EPS in the $1.05 to $1.07 range. And this forecast does include $0.02 of net dilution from the Nova acquisition, which is driven by purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. Q2 revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year. Organic revenues compared to the prior year are expected to be down 2% due to a 3% decline at Defense. But on a sequential basis, ITT organic revenue is projected to improve 5% in the second quarter. 
For the full year, Defense revenue guidance was adjusted to 3% based on revised timing of orders and customer fielding plans. We increased total Fluid revenue to 5% from 2% to reflect the Nova acquisition. In total, revenue for Motion & Flow Control was increased to 6% and organic revenue was increased to 7% from flat in the prior guidance. So ITT 2010 revenue is now expected to grow 4%. Organic revenue guidance was increased to 3% from 2%. Segment operating margin guidance was increased 10 basis points from the prior guidance to 12.3%, due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions.

This has a high level of relatedness to Fluid Technology.

But having said that, you can take these same technologies and expand into other segments such as life sciences and healthcare. And so when we talk about ITT analytics as a new platform, while we will be growing initially through the limbs of Fluid Tech, we fully anticipate to be able to expand into other segments. And so I think it's a really nice way to grow a new platform in areas in beverage, healthcare, life sciences, environmental testing and monitoring and so forth. So yes, we fully intend to openly growing out that area. And keep in mind that Nova Analytics already has about 40% of their business outside of water. They're in food and beverage.

We're seeing a cautious recovery in the United States for reasons of confidence and so forth that we're all aware of. So something on the order of two or maybe two plus in the United States. Europe is actually recovering a little bit lower and a little bit slower. There's obviously current day concerns, with respect to some of the credit issues we're all reading about. On the flip side, we're seeing substantial growth in the emerging markets, most notably Brazil, couple of the economies in the GCC, certainly India and China. Our team just returned from a fairly expensive series of trips in the Middle East, China and India. And one of my observations on that, Nicole, was that while these economies slowed down as an example, China was quoted to slow down from 9% to the 7% range. The fact is, there is an unstoppable transition from lower class to middle class, unstoppable population growth. And in these economies, you're just seeing a continued very, very strong demand. They're going to be tripling their power generation capacity in India over the next five years. It is a phenomenal amount of infrastructure that's being put in. And I think everyone knows the Chinese numbers where we're going to have, in the next 15 years, we're going to increase the middle class population in China to a number, which is in excess of the amount of people that actually live in the United States, over 350 million people. So these dynamics -- I mean, having been there real time over the past month, these dynamics are giving us a great deal of confidence in some of these emerging markets. So that's our summary. I think that the only concern is ultimately going to be the flow of money and the efficiency of these capital markets."

We're going to finish the year in the $5 billion backlog range. Based on our ambitions now and the, sort of, certainty around our probabilistic weighted contract wins, we think that we'll see another year in defense in the 2011 timefr",773,"Yes, we're on track. We're going to finish the year in the $5 billion backlog range. Based on our ambitions now and the, sort of, certainty around our probabilistic weighted contract wins, we think that we'll see another year in defense in the 2011 timeframe. That's in the same range as what we're seeing this year.
And now before we close, I guess I'll just take this opportunity to offer an overarching thought, just somewhat consistent or somewhat as a follow-on to Nicole's question. And it's really all about our growth strategy and where we find ourself in this journey through this economic recovery. I think to begin with, our performance this quarter validates the fact that we do have a resilient portfolio. Thanks to some of the diversification and really put our investments. I'm going to try to frame that for you. Over the past several years, we've really aggressively repositioned this portfolio to better address these growing global trends, such as global safety and mobile network society and water scarcity. And we've also been working for several years to offset these anticipated declines in some of these core arm services budgets that we understand, I think you all understand, are creating a significant headwind for us this year.
Notwithstanding those headwinds on the Defense budget, if you, sort of, take out these major core arm service budget changes, the balance of our Defense business is actually growing in the 9%, 10% range. So what you can see is that this company was a company that performed well in the economic downturn. In fact, our earnings and revenue growth numbers were among the best in our peer group. So I think it's safe to conclude that this strategy is working for us. And just to reflect that our current earnings guidance will represent a record EPS for the company, which will be a 2% increase over 2008. So we like our strategic position. 
A couple of really specific reasons why we like it. Since 2007, we have invested $1.2 billion in our highest growth commercial opportunities. That investment include $875 million for strategic acquisitions, most notably the IMC, Lang [ph] and Nova acquisitions. We've invested an additional $250 million for restructuring and realignment of our activities, and an incremental $105 million for organic growth investments to stimulate our global marketing capacity and new product technology. And on top of all that, we have invested a very substantial amount of capital to build 11 world class new facilities in China, India, Saudi Arabia, Poland, Mexico and the Czech Republic.
So despite the headwinds of the short cycle economic downturn, we are thrilled and believe very strongly that these investments on the commercial side of the business have very solidly positioned us to grow in these vital markets. At the same time, thanks to Dave Melcher in the Defense and Information team, we have been expanding our technologies and capabilities to penetrate these growing non-arm services opportunities such as NASA, the FAA, the Homeland Security, commercial market and international markets. And what has been somewhat invisible to all of you, because these have been program by program wins, is that this strategy we have communicated to you today, with a number of significant long term wins, have driven our non-arm services revenue to over $1.5 billion, representing 25% of the Defense & Information Solutions revenue. And so if you go back to, kind of, characterize where we were since 2006, our cumulative annual growth rate in this non-arm services category has been 25%. So this defense adjacency strategy that we've been communicating has really, really worked well. And despite these potential pressures in the core arm services activities, again, in the Defense and the broader Information Solutions business, we believe we're very, very well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth.
So that, coupled with the fact that we will continue to see strong free cash flow generation even with all these investments and portfolio changes, gives us confidence that we've got an engineer that drives the cycle of reinvestment and strong strategic and financial opportunities to develop this capital. So we feel good about where we are. And I just wanted to conclude with this sort of longer term overarching view of this portfolio. We not only are performing well, but we've been investing significantly to reposition in the right markets and right technologies. And we've been doing a nice job of diversification.
So with that, I will conclude with my pleasure on the progress we've been made. And thank you all for your interest in ITT. We'll talk with you next time."

Let me start by sharing some exciting news that we just received.

Let me start by sharing some exciting news that we just received. Our Information Systems business just won two contracts totaling $800 million to provide facilities operations, maintenance and training services in both Northern and Southern Afghanistan. As part of our strategy to expand our Information Solutions business into new areas, we're really pleased that both contracts were awarded by a new customer for this business, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. So we're really thrilled to initiate a long-term relationship with the Corps and further, we're going to continue some ongoing work to explore some future opportunities with our Fluid Technology business in the Corps, which is the world's largest provider of environmental engineering solutions.
Today, we're also announcing our plan to divest CAS, the $240 million SETA or Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance business in our Defense segment. This divestiture will reduce the potential for future OCI or organizational conflicts of interest. CAS, as some of you know, is an outstanding business. However, as we continue to grow our Defense & Information Solutions business in adjacent growth areas, CAS will be better positioned for growth with another company. As a result, CAS' financial results will be now presented in discontinued operations and will not be reflected in continuing results or our future guidance.
Turning to the second quarter. We're once again pleased with ITT's strong productivity and solid operating margins, and we're making substantial progress realigning our portfolio of essential products and services. Our second quarter adjusted continuing EPS of $1.14 exceeded our expectations by $0.10 per share, and it represents a 9% growth compared to the prior year. 
Our Motion & Flow control business once again delivered exceptional performance with significant increases in orders, revenue and operating income. Our Fluid Technology team delivered solid margin expansion with outstanding productivity. And we're continuing to see stabilizing market conditions across our commercial businesses, which was validated by very strong order growth in our organic segments.
Our Defense business delivered improved productivity and lower expenses, which were enabled by the defense transformation our strategic realignment. Organic revenue declined 3% in the quarter, but that also exceeded our expectations. Our strategy and defense to expand in adjacencies continues to work for us as we leverage the diversity of our businesses to offset declines in some of our core products, mainly the U.S. SINCGARS [Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System] and the crew. The weaker Q2 orders reflect timing shifts, either into the second half of 2010 or deferrals into 2011.
So as you think about the year, we recalibrated our Defense sales down by about $500 million. But keep in mind that half of this adjustment will relates to the discontinued CAS business. The other portion primarily relates to an Iraqi SINCGARS order that was deferred into 2011.
By way of background, you may recall that we were awarded this contract in 2008, and we have already outfitted 3 of 11 Iraqi battalions. But despite the vital need for this equipment, future turn ons of this contract are now expected to be delayed. But the important takeaway here as you're reflecting on our Defense business is that nothing has fundamentally changed in the architecture and in fact, our strategy to drive adjacent growth is accelerating. So keep in mind when you're looking at the backlog that our Q2 funded orders and backlog statistics do not reflect $2.2 billion of recently awarded long-term service contracts with the FAA, SE2020 program and the Afghanistan North and South contracts.
So in total, we delivered a very strong second quarter and a focused execution of our global teams, combined with the improving conditions in certain end markets, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a solid second half in 2010. This performance positions us to fully offset the full year $0.11 impact from our recent portfolio positioning activities. So as a result, we're raising our full year operating continued adjusted EPS and we're growing this EPS by 11% now in 2010. And keep in mind that this performance follows a best-in-class EPS result in 2009, which all results in a records earnings performance for 2010, our best year yet.
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that 2010 has been an exciting year for ITT as we continue to purposefully execute our strategy to reposition this portfolio. Following the first quarter creation of ITT Analytics after the Nova acquisition, in the second quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Godwin Pumps and we acquired Canberra Pumps in Brazil. These investments will total $1 billion, and we greatly expanded the scope, reach and technical capabilities of our Fluid Technology segment. 
The Nova acquisition provides an attractive entry point, indeed an adjacent growth platform that we've been targeting for years. And after a couple of months of working together, we're all thrilled with the growth opportunities that we see with ITT Analytics in the water, wastewater, industrial process and nutrition markets. We're also pleased that Nova is already exceeding our expectations for 2010.
Godwin Pumps will further expand our global position in water, wastewater and industrial processes. Godwin's a leading supplier of automatic self-priming portable pumping solutions, servicing attractive segments in industrial, mining, construction, municipal and oil and gas. Godwin Pumps is a great compliment to our existing Fluid Technology portfolio, and with Godwin, we expect to establish ITT among the leaders in a growing $3 billion global dewatering market.
We've also been very active increasing our presence in emerging markets and Canberra Pumps expands our footprint in Latin America, enabling us to provide more products to the growing oil and gas and mining markets there.
On the Defense side, for the past four years in anticipation of budgetary pressures, we've been very aggressively penetrating new customers and adjacencies. As a result, we have successfully grown over 25% or $1.5 billion of Defense revenue outside the U.S. armed services budget. So as we see budget pressures in our core DoD areas, we're pleased with the offsetting progress we're making with important customers, which include, of course, NASA, FAA, Department of Homeland Security and numerous international customers.
So as we rebalance our revenue mix and increase our leadership positions in growing markets, this year's transactions will add nearly $400 million in revenue to one of the largest fluid business platforms in the world. As a result, the commercial rating of our portfolio increases to 46% of our revenue base, up from 42% at the beginning of the year. And if you divide our Defense segment into an armed services and non-U.S. armed services components, you're going to now see that our aggregate commercial and non-U.S. armed services mix is now 60% of our portfolio.
And just a final note, since the EPG [Electrical Products Group] Conference, many of you have asked about how we plan to execute the portfolio repositioning strategy, and I think the best answer to these questions are really pictured in this slide here. We're going to continue to make organic investments and acquisition in markets where we already have a solid foundation. And these, as we've mentioned, include analytical instrumentation, air traffic management, dewatering, fluid, and most notably, treatment and global solutions, as well as cyber technology. And as you know, these are all solid businesses that already exist within ITT today and these markets align nicely with enduring and essential global trends. So the result of this strategy will be a rebalancing of our business portfolio and our end markets. And as some of these growth platforms reach a critical mass in the future, we then will move to expand the reporting unit visibility accordingly.
So with that summary, I'll turn it over to Denise to discuss the specifics of the quarter."
280322,109475066,70838,"ITT Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

Slide 5, you'll see that second quarter 2010 revenues improved 1%. When you exclude the positive benefits from acquisitions and the negative impacts from foreign exchange, our organic revenue was flat. In total, this performance was consistent with our expectations. The mix was slightly different. Defense was in line, Fluid was down due to the European Municipal weakness and Motion exceeded our strength across all their end markets.
Motion & Flow Control 21% organic growth, reflected recent share gains and improving end market demand. In Fluid, organic revenue was down 4%, mostly due to difficult comparisons in our Late Cycle Industrial Process business, as well as weakness in our European Municipal business. However, this trend is expected to turn positive in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. 
Total organic orders declined 22%. Defense declined due to difficult prior-year comparisons and delays in deferrals in contract timing, but commercial orders were very strong. Motion & Flow improved 70% and Fluid improved 15%.  Segment operating income improved 7%, and margins improved 80 basis points due to operational productivity from global strategic sourcing, restructuring and our Lean Six Sigma activity. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $250 million was ahead of expectations, and it is in line with our full year target conversion of 100% of net income. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have $844 million in cash. We have a net debt to net capital ratio of 13.4% and that does include the funding of the Q1 Nova acquisition. It does not yet include funding impacts of Godwin or the future proceeds from the CAS divestiture.  And then lastly, our adjusted continuing earnings per share, when you exclude the discontinued CAS business, grew 9% to $1.14 per share. This also excluded an $0.08 net benefit from the completion of a prior-year tax audit.
Turn to Slide 6, and we'll talk about Fluid Technology's second quarter results. Total Fluid revenues improved 1%. When you exclude favorable foreign exchange and acquisition benefits, organic revenue was down 4%. But on a sequential basis, organic revenue improved 13%, reflecting some seasonality. Residential and Commercial Water grew 2% organically due to stabilizing global residential condition and minor restocking in the commercial building markets. Water & Wastewater declined 1%, as strong global dewatering and double digit U.S. treatment growth was more than offset by European Municipal softness. Organic revenue in industrial process was down 16% due to lower oil and gas and mining project activity that was compared to a very strong prior year. However, this result did exceed expectations as performance in the high-margin Aftermarket business improved nicely in the quarter.
Fluid operating income grew 16%, and operating margins expanded 190 basis points on 100 basis point of operational productivity. You know, these improvements reflect the benefit of very aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that more than offset cost inflation and mix.
Fluid organic orders grew 15% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07 due significant improvement in industrial process and Water & Wastewater. Organic orders at Industrial Process grew 20%, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07. The strength was due to improving aftermarket demand and strong oil and gas and industrial project activity. IP's orders in Latin America grew 68% in the quarter and showed further benefit from our second quarter acquisition of Canberra Pumps. Canberra will help Fluid drive growth in Brazil's oil, gas and mining industries. And In addition, we plan to introduce Fluid's leading-edge technologies to Canberra's existing product portfolio to better serve our growing Brazilian customer base.
Water & Wastewater's organic orders expanded 15% due to Dewatering, U.S. Municipal and some large global treatment projects. It more than offset weakness in European Municipal, and Water & Wastewater's book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.12.
On Slide 7, let's take a look at the Godwin acquisition that we do expect to close during the third quarter. So Godwin Pumps is a great complement to our existing dewatering portfolio. ITT's combined Dewatering worldwide business will enjoy over 15% market share and it will represent nearly $465 million in annual revenue, with very significant future growth prospects. Dewatering, which is the removal of unwanted water and other fluids, is an attractive adjacency for us because dewatering is driven by climate and regulatory drivers. It's highly fragmented and it services attractive end markets that we know very well like mining, oil and gas, construction, industrial and municipal. 
So why Godwin Pumps and why now?  Well, Godwin has a history of strong financial performance and a solid reputation in the industry. They have complementary products to our existing dewatering portfolio, including their automatic self-priming portable pumps, and we do see significant geographic expansion opportunities to bring Godwin's capabilities through our global distribution and customer networks. We expect the Godwin acquisition to close in the third quarter, to be dilutive by $0.04 in 2010 via transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustment, but we do expect this business to be nicely accretive in 2011.
Now let's turn to Slide 8, and let's review another extraordinary quarter for Motion & Flow Control. Organic revenue grew 21%, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. Flow Control expanded 33% due to a 40% improvement in marine and a 20% improvement in beverage. Interconnect Solutions grew 25% due to improved demand across all end markets. The performance was led by triple-digit growth in the handheld communication market. And Motion tech delivered organic revenue growth of 19% that reflected benefits from recent share wins and the European automotive stimulus.
So Motion & Flow Control operating income improved 27% due to benefits from the higher volumes, expanded productivity actions and lower restructuring costs. Their operating margins improved 90 basis points in total, and excluding certain costs associated with product transition, operating margins would have improved over 250 basis points.
Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 17%. The 62% growth at Interconnect Solutions reflected strong demand across all served markets. The 30% increase at control technology reflected industrial and aerospace demand outside of Europe. Motion Technologies' orders declined 16% due to expiring European stimulus programs. However, Motion Tech continued to win global platform in both auto and global rail. The auto wins included BMW, Renault and Opel.
As a result of our strong Q2 performance and the generally positive demand indicators across most end markets served, we are raising the full year Motion & Flow Control segment's organic revenue forecast from 7% to 18%. At year end, our growth in both the automotive and aerospace market is projected to be in the high single digits and in general, industrial, we are forecasting in the high teens.
Defense & Information Solutions' second quarter results are on Slide 9. Defense's organic revenue declined 3%, which was right in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. Geospatial revenue grew 14% due to a 26% improvement at night vision that included triple digit international strength. Second quarter international night vision customers included Israel, Canada and Norway. 
Information systems improved 3% due to expanded activity under the LOGCAP contract and the FAA next generation air traffic control program, ADS-B. Electronic Systems declined 12% due to anticipated reduction in U.S. SINCGARS and CREW 2.1 productions. These were partially offset by increased sales of special-purpose jammers, radar systems and composite structures.
operating margins expanded 10 basis points, benefiting from 100 basis points of operational improvements that were partially offset by pensions and $7 million of restructuring expenses. The benefits associated with the Defense transformation are already exceeding our very aggressive plans. Our current annual gross savings target from the Defense restructuring and cost-containment actions is $110 million. So achieving this goal will drive an incremental $60 million of benefit into 2011.
Organic orders decline due to the deferral into 2011 of radio and jammer equipment orders and timing delays of service contracts and jammer upgrade that are now expected in the second half of 2010. In addition, the prior year included $500 million of radio and special-purpose jammer orders, which again underscores the lumpy nature of quarterly Defense orders.
Based primarily on the international deferrals and the adjustment to eliminate the $100 million of backlog associated with the discontinued CAS business, we now forecast year-end backlog to be in the $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion range. In the Air Traffic Management area, we were awarded a $1.4 billion system engineering 2020 contract in May, that is to conduct development work across all dimensions of air traffic control, including ground systems, aircraft systems and safety security and environmental standards. We also recently announced the commercial availability of real-time U.S. air traffic data to customers such as airlines, airport operators and companies. 
It's interesting to note that the $2.2 billion of long-term services contracts that we've recently won will have minimal impact on our backlog and order statistics in the future. And that's because we only include fully-funded orders in our backlog and these awards will typically find in six- to 12-month increments.
Now let's turn to Slide 10, and let's walk through our revised 2010 EPS guidance. Let's start by reviewing the Q2 performance. So in the second quarter, our adjusted EPS of $1.14 per share exceeded our revised continuing EPS guidance, adjusted for CAS by $0.10. And that was due to $0.06 of operational strength from all segments and higher volume at Motion. Corporate taxes and share count were also favorable to expectations. 
Now let's talk about the full year. Our new 2010 adjusted EPS guidance range is $4.08 to $4.18. Let's keep in mind that this new guidance reflects $0.11 of dilution associated with the recently announced portfolio actions. So if you exclude the impact of these actions, our guidance would have been $4.19 to $4.29, and at the midpoint, this is $0.11 higher than our previously issued guidance.
The new $4.13 midpoint represents 11% growth versus a comparable $3.73 per share in 2009. We've tightened the range to better reflect our expectations for the full year. Again, keep in mind that our new guidance midpoint includes $0.04 of dilution related to the recently announced Godwin and Canberra transactions and it excludes $0.07 of earnings from the discontinued Defense CAS business. However, our strong second quarter performance and our balanced second half outlook positioned us to completely offset the $0.11 of dilution associated with these portfolio actions. Now in order to help model the potential impacts of the Defense discontinued operations, we have included a reconciliation in the appendix.
On Slide 11, we've provided additional details around our third quarter and 2010 outlook. For the third quarter, we are projecting a 1% increase in total revenues to $2.7 billion and continuing adjusted EPS in the $0.94 to $0.98 range. This forecast does include $0.03 of net dilution from the Godwin and Canberra acquisition. It also excludes about $0.02 from the discontinued Defense CAS business. It should be noted that this forecast also reflects a reallocation of our second half Defense revenues based on current customer delivery schedules. So this results in a Defense third quarter revenue forecast that is down 5% versus the prior year. 
The Fluid third quarter organic growth forecast is 5% and Motion is 16%. Q3 segment margin performance also reflects higher FX, material costs and investments when compared to Q2.
For the full year, Defense organic revenue growth is expected to be flat compared to the prior year. That's due to revised timing of orders and customer fielding plans. Total Fluid revenue growth was increased to 6%, while full year organic results are expected to be flat due to some additional slowing in Europe and the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange. Motion & Flow Control's total revenue growth guidance was raised to 14% and organic revenue was increased to 18% from 7% due to improved conditions across all major end markets served.
2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 3% in total and 2% organically to $11 billion. This forecast excludes approximately $240 million of discontinued cash revenue. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.5% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions. The full year operating margin performance is 60 basis points better than the prior year.
So now let's turn things over to Tom, and let's begin the Q&A."

That's a one-time item that hit. When we look at the margins going into Q3 and Q4, we're going to see some really nice improvement in those Motion & Flow margins. And the reason is, is because we've got some very strong top line performance, which is going to flow very nicely through in the back half of the year. So when we look at Motion & Flow, and we look at them on a full year basis, from an operational perspective, their margins are improving over 200 basis points.

We also saw some really nice strength on the Treatment side of the business in the U.S. And so in the second quarter, we actually saw our Treatment business being up about 20% in the U.S. So we're seeing some nice growth there, and we are seeing decent growth in Transport also."

The three major dynamics that are occurring in this economy is, you're seeing an impact of foreign exchange. We do have changes in incremental investments, which we believe are appropriate for the long term, particularly to position more strongly in emerging markets. And we do have the municipal pressure in Europe, as we mentioned. And in some cases, quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing changes in the IP business. So those factors somewhat cloud the long-term story in Fluid Technology, which is to say that we are exceptionally well positioned with our cost base. We're seeing a very, very nice order growth, which once we get past some of these shorter-cycle phenomenons, we should be able to leverage very, very nicely on the top line. So as we're just now in the process of detailing the 2011 plan, we are expecting strong organic growth out of this platform and strong margin expansion. And I think what we're seeing here this year is a lot of short-cycle volatility, somewhat driven by the economic recovery that we're all well aware of."

Cadence is determined not by the magnitude of the pipeline, but a combination of action, ability and timing, and then ultimately, valuation. So as you know, it's always hard to be predictive in that area. But I would say we're going to try to stay on this pace. But it's always hard to predict how it's going to come out. With respect to aerospace, aerospace is an attractive area. And despite the fact that it is a little slow right now, as you all know, we do see it long term. I have not mentioned that recently simply because our pipeline is so strong in the other areas which are equally attractive. But aerospace is an area that I would say falls into attractive, but it's not in the front of our pipeline at this point in time. 
Well, Nigel, I want to thank you for your questions and thank everyone for your interest. And let me just close very quickly, and first of all, apologize for the timing delay, we'll get that fixed. But the highlights, as we're thinking about it is that we did have a solid second quarter, beating expectations, and we're raising the full year operating outlook. And we're proud of the fact that we've offseted the impacts of this portfolio positioning. We do continue to see strong productivity across every one of our business segments. We're excited, quite frankly, about the strong performance in the short-cycle Motion & Flow Control business. And despite some of these headwinds, which Denise just covered, the longer-cycle commercial businesses continue to deliver very strong order growth, which is setting us up for a strong revenue and earnings year in the Fluid Technology business next year.
The diversified Defense business continues to overcome budget pressures in the core product areas because we've been very successfully diversifying this customer base. And the portfolio strategy, the rebalance is working, having just added $1 billion investment to the base. So as I think about where we are, this business model at ITT is designed to perform well over time. And our track record over the past several years validates the merits of this business model design. We work really hard to align to essential and attractive segments of enduring global needs. We execute well with exceptional strategic management processes, and we spend a lot of time to drive a very significant differential reallocation strategies to optimize our opportunity. And this all works because underneath, we have great people and great leadership, with a very strong underlying value system. And this combination is really a magic elixir for employee engagement, innovation and customer loyalty.
So in the midst of a lot of concerns in this economic time, let me point out that even in light of a highly unstabilized and volatile global economy and with the pressures we understand the Defense budget, in 2010, ITT will surpass our record 2008 performance by delivering an 11% adjusted growth off the strongest 2009 EPS performance in our peer group. So we're turning in yet another record year of earnings performance while we are rebalancing this portfolio and powering through quite successfully a volatile economic period. So I just wanted to close on a high note, we're proud about what we have accomplished, and we look forward to catching up with you on the next quarter. Thank you very much."

Let me start by sharing some exciting news that we just received. Our Information Systems business just won two contracts totaling $800 million to provide facilities operations, maintenance and training services in both Northern and Southern Afghanistan. As part of our strategy to expand our Information Solutions business into new areas, we're really pleased that both contracts were awarded by a new customer for this business, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. So we're really thrilled to initiate a long-term relationship with the Corps and further, we're going to continue some ongoing work to explore some future opportunities with our Fluid Technology business in the Corps, which is the world's largest provider of environmental engineering solutions.
Today, we're also announcing our plan to divest CAS, the $240 million SETA or Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance business in our Defense segment. This divestiture will reduce the potential for future OCI or organizational conflicts of interest. CAS, as some of you know, is an outstanding business. However, as we continue to grow our Defense & Information Solutions business in adjacent growth areas, CAS will be better positioned for growth with another company. As a result, CAS' financial results will be now presented in discontinued operations and will not be reflected in continuing results or our future guidance.
Turning to the second quarter. We're once again pleased with ITT's strong productivity and solid operating margins, and we're making substantial progress realigning our portfolio of essential products and services. Our second quarter adjusted continuing EPS of $1.14 exceeded our expectations by $0.10 per share, and it represents a 9% growth compared to the prior year. 
Our Motion & Flow control business once again delivered exceptional performance with significant increases in orders, revenue and operating income. Our Fluid Technology team delivered solid margin expansion with outstanding productivity. And we're continuing to see stabilizing market conditions across our commercial businesses, which was validated by very strong order growth in our organic segments.
Our Defense business delivered improved productivity and lower expenses, which were enabled by the defense transformation our strategic realignment. Organic revenue declined 3% in the quarter, but that also exceeded our expectations. Our strategy and defense to expand in adjacencies continues to work for us as we leverage the diversity of our businesses to offset declines in some of our core products, mainly the U.S. SINCGARS [Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System] and the crew. The weaker Q2 orders reflect timing shifts, either into the second half of 2010 or deferrals into 2011.
So as you think about the year, we recalibrated our Defense sales down by about $500 million. But keep in mind that half of this adjustment will relates to the discontinued CAS business. The other portion primarily relates to an Iraqi SINCGARS order that was deferred into 2011.
By way of background, you may recall that we were awarded this contract in 2008, and we have already outfitted 3 of 11 Iraqi battalions. But despite the vital need for this equipment, future turn ons of this contract are now expected to be delayed. But the important takeaway here as you're reflecting on our Defense business is that nothing has fundamentally changed in the architecture and in fact, our strategy to drive adjacent growth is accelerating. So keep in mind when you're looking at the backlog that our Q2 funded orders and backlog statistics do not reflect $2.2 billion of recently awarded long-term service contracts with the FAA, SE2020 program and the Afghanistan North and South contracts.
So in total, we delivered a very strong second quarter and a focused execution of our global teams, combined with the improving conditions in certain end markets, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a solid second half in 2010. This performance positions us to fully offset the full year $0.11 impact from our recent portfolio positioning activities. So as a result, we're raising our full year operating continued adjusted EPS and we're growing this EPS by 11% now in 2010. And keep in mind that this performance follows a best-in-class EPS result in 2009, which all results in a records earnings performance for 2010, our best year yet.
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that 2010 has been an exciting year for ITT as we continue to purposefully execute our strategy to reposition this portfolio. Following the first quarter creation of ITT Analytics after the Nova acquisition, in the second quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Godwin Pumps and we acquired Canberra Pumps in Brazil. These investments will total $1 billion, and we greatly expanded the scope, reach and technical capabilities of our Fluid Technology segment. 
The Nova acquisition provides an attractive entry point, indeed an adjacent growth platform that we've been targeting for years. And after a couple of months of working together, we're all thrilled with the growth opportunities that we see with ITT Analytics in the water, wastewater, industrial process and nutrition markets. We're also pleased that Nova is already exceeding our expectations for 2010.
Godwin Pumps will further expand our global position in water, wastewater and industrial processes. Godwin's a leading supplier of automatic self-priming portable pumping solutions, servicing attractive segments in industrial, mining, construction, municipal and oil and gas. Godwin Pumps is a great compliment to our existing Fluid Technology portfolio, and with Godwin, we expect to establish ITT among the leaders in a growing $3 billion global dewatering market.
We've also been very active increasing our presence in emerging markets and Canberra Pumps expands our footprint in Latin America, enabling us to provide more products to the growing oil and gas and mining markets there.
On the Defense side, for the past four years in anticipation of budgetary pressures, we've been very aggressively penetrating new customers and adjacencies. As a result, we have successfully grown over 25% or $1.5 billion of Defense revenue outside the U.S. armed services budget. So as we see budget pressures in our core DoD areas, we're pleased with the offsetting progress we're making with important customers, which include, of course, NASA, FAA, Department of Homeland Security and numerous international customers.
So as we rebalance our revenue mix and increase our leadership positions in growing markets, this year's transactions will add nearly $400 million in revenue to one of the largest fluid business platforms in the world. As a result, the commercial rating of our portfolio increases to 46% of our revenue base, up from 42% at the beginning of the year. And if you divide our Defense segment into an armed services and non-U.S. armed services components, you're going to now see that our aggregate commercial and non-U.S. armed services mix is now 60% of our portfolio.
And just a final note, since the EPG [Electrical Products Group] Conference, many of you have asked about how we plan to execute the portfolio repositioning strategy, and I think the best answer to these questions are really pictured in this slide here. We're going to continue to make organic investments and acquisition in markets where we already have a solid foundation. And these, as we've mentioned, include analytical instrumentation, air traffic management, dewatering, fluid, and most notably, treatment and global solutions, as well as cyber technology. And as you know, these are all solid businesses that already exist within ITT today and these markets align nicely with enduring and essential global trends. So the result of this strategy will be a rebalancing of our business portfolio and our end markets. And as some of these growth platforms reach a critical mass in the future, we then will move to expand the reporting unit visibility accordingly.
So with that summary, I'll turn it over to Denise to discuss the specifics of the quarter.

Slide 5, you'll see that second quarter 2010 revenues improved 1%. When you exclude the positive benefits from acquisitions and the negative impacts from foreign exchange, our organic revenue was flat. In total, this performance was consistent with our expectations. The mix was slightly different. Defense was in line, Fluid was down due to the European Municipal weakness and Motion exceeded our strength across all their end markets.
Motion & Flow Control 21% organic growth, reflected recent share gains and improving end market demand. In Fluid, organic revenue was down 4%, mostly due to difficult comparisons in our Late Cycle Industrial Process business, as well as weakness in our European Municipal business. However, this trend is expected to turn positive in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. 
Total organic orders declined 22%. Defense declined due to difficult prior-year comparisons and delays in deferrals in contract timing, but commercial orders were very strong. Motion & Flow improved 70% and Fluid improved 15%.  Segment operating income improved 7%, and margins improved 80 basis points due to operational productivity from global strategic sourcing, restructuring and our Lean Six Sigma activity. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $250 million was ahead of expectations, and it is in line with our full year target conversion of 100% of net income. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have $844 million in cash. We have a net debt to net capital ratio of 13.4% and that does include the funding of the Q1 Nova acquisition. It does not yet include funding impacts of Godwin or the future proceeds from the CAS divestiture.  And then lastly, our adjusted continuing earnings per share, when you exclude the discontinued CAS business, grew 9% to $1.14 per share. This also excluded an $0.08 net benefit from the completion of a prior-year tax audit.
Turn to Slide 6, and we'll talk about Fluid Technology's second quarter results. Total Fluid revenues improved 1%. When you exclude favorable foreign exchange and acquisition benefits, organic revenue was down 4%. But on a sequential basis, organic revenue improved 13%, reflecting some seasonality. Residential and Commercial Water grew 2% organically due to stabilizing global residential condition and minor restocking in the commercial building markets. Water & Wastewater declined 1%, as strong global dewatering and double digit U.S. treatment growth was more than offset by European Municipal softness. Organic revenue in industrial process was down 16% due to lower oil and gas and mining project activity that was compared to a very strong prior year. However, this result did exceed expectations as performance in the high-margin Aftermarket business improved nicely in the quarter.
Fluid operating income grew 16%, and operating margins expanded 190 basis points on 100 basis point of operational productivity. You know, these improvements reflect the benefit of very aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that more than offset cost inflation and mix.
Fluid organic orders grew 15% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07 due significant improvement in industrial process and Water & Wastewater. Organic orders at Industrial Process grew 20%, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07. The strength was due to improving aftermarket demand and strong oil and gas and industrial project activity. IP's orders in Latin America grew 68% in the quarter and showed further benefit from our second quarter acquisition of Canberra Pumps. Canberra will help Fluid drive growth in Brazil's oil, gas and mining industries. And In addition, we plan to introduce Fluid's leading-edge technologies to Canberra's existing product portfolio to better serve our growing Brazilian customer base.
Water & Wastewater's organic orders expanded 15% due to Dewatering, U.S. Municipal and some large global treatment projects. It more than offset weakness in European Municipal, and Water & Wastewater's book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.12.
On Slide 7, let's take a look at the Godwin acquisition that we do expect to close during the third quarter. So Godwin Pumps is a great complement to our existing dewatering portfolio. ITT's combined Dewatering worldwide business will enjoy over 15% market share and it will represent nearly $465 million in annual revenue, with very significant future growth prospects. Dewatering, which is the removal of unwanted water and other fluids, is an attractive adjacency for us because dewatering is driven by climate and regulatory drivers. It's highly fragmented and it services attractive end markets that we know very well like mining, oil and gas, construction, industrial and municipal. 
So why Godwin Pumps and why now?  Well, Godwin has a history of strong financial performance and a solid reputation in the industry. They have complementary products to our existing dewatering portfolio, including their automatic self-priming portable pumps, and we do see significant geographic expansion opportunities to bring Godwin's capabilities through our global distribution and customer networks. We expect the Godwin acquisition to close in the third quarter, to be dilutive by $0.04 in 2010 via transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustment, but we do expect this business to be nicely accretive in 2011.
Now let's turn to Slide 8, and let's review another extraordinary quarter for Motion & Flow Control. Organic revenue grew 21%, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. Flow Control expanded 33% due to a 40% improvement in marine and a 20% improvement in beverage. Interconnect Solutions grew 25% due to improved demand across all end markets. The performance was led by triple-digit growth in the handheld communication market. And Motion tech delivered organic revenue growth of 19% that reflected benefits from recent share wins and the European automotive stimulus.
So Motion & Flow Control operating income improved 27% due to benefits from the higher volumes, expanded productivity actions and lower restructuring costs. Their operating margins improved 90 basis points in total, and excluding certain costs associated with product transition, operating margins would have improved over 250 basis points.
Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 17%. The 62% growth at Interconnect Solutions reflected strong demand across all served markets. The 30% increase at control technology reflected industrial and aerospace demand outside of Europe. Motion Technologies' orders declined 16% due to expiring European stimulus programs. However, Motion Tech continued to win global platform in both auto and global rail. The auto wins included BMW, Renault and Opel.
As a result of our strong Q2 performance and the generally positive demand indicators across most end markets served, we are raising the full year Motion & Flow Control segment's organic revenue forecast from 7% to 18%. At year end, our growth in both the automotive and aerospace market is projected to be in the high single digits and in general, industrial, we are forecasting in the high teens.
Defense & Information Solutions' second quarter results are on Slide 9. Defense's organic revenue declined 3%, which was right in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. Geospatial revenue grew 14% due to a 26% improvement at night vision that included triple digit international strength. Second quarter international night vision customers included Israel, Canada and Norway. 
Information systems improved 3% due to expanded activity under the LOGCAP contract and the FAA next generation air traffic control program, ADS-B. Electronic Systems declined 12% due to anticipated reduction in U.S. SINCGARS and CREW 2.1 productions. These were partially offset by increased sales of special-purpose jammers, radar systems and composite structures.
operating margins expanded 10 basis points, benefiting from 100 basis points of operational improvements that were partially offset by pensions and $7 million of restructuring expenses. The benefits associated with the Defense transformation are already exceeding our very aggressive plans. Our current annual gross savings target from the Defense restructuring and cost-containment actions is $110 million. So achieving this goal will drive an incremental $60 million of benefit into 2011.
Organic orders decline due to the deferral into 2011 of radio and jammer equipment orders and timing delays of service contracts and jammer upgrade that are now expected in the second half of 2010. In addition, the prior year included $500 million of radio and special-purpose jammer orders, which again underscores the lumpy nature of quarterly Defense orders.
Based primarily on the international deferrals and the adjustment to eliminate the $100 million of backlog associated with the discontinued CAS business, we now forecast year-end backlog to be in the $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion range. In the Air Traffic Management area, we were awarded a $1.4 billion system engineering 2020 contract in May, that is to conduct development work across all dimensions of air traffic control, including ground systems, aircraft systems and safety security and environmental standards. We also recently announced the commercial availability of real-time U.S. air traffic data to customers such as airlines, airport operators and companies. 
It's interesting to note that the $2.2 billion of long-term services contracts that we've recently won will have minimal impact on our backlog and order statistics in the future. And that's because we only include fully-funded orders in our backlog and these awards will typically find in six- to 12-month increments.
Now let's turn to Slide 10, and let's walk through our revised 2010 EPS guidance. Let's start by reviewing the Q2 performance. So in the second quarter, our adjusted EPS of $1.14 per share exceeded our revised continuing EPS guidance, adjusted for CAS by $0.10. And that was due to $0.06 of operational strength from all segments and higher volume at Motion. Corporate taxes and share count were also favorable to expectations. 
Now let's talk about the full year. Our new 2010 adjusted EPS guidance range is $4.08 to $4.18. Let's keep in mind that this new guidance reflects $0.11 of dilution associated with the recently announced portfolio actions. So if you exclude the impact of these actions, our guidance would have been $4.19 to $4.29, and at the midpoint, this is $0.11 higher than our previously issued guidance.
The new $4.13 midpoint represents 11% growth versus a comparable $3.73 per share in 2009. We've tightened the range to better reflect our expectations for the full year. Again, keep in mind that our new guidance midpoint includes $0.04 of dilution related to the recently announced Godwin and Canberra transactions and it excludes $0.07 of earnings from the discontinued Defense CAS business. However, our strong second quarter performance and our balanced second half outlook positioned us to completely offset the $0.11 of dilution associated with these portfolio actions. Now in order to help model the potential impacts of the Defense discontinued operations, we have included a reconciliation in the appendix.
On Slide 11, we've provided additional details around our third quarter and 2010 outlook. For the third quarter, we are projecting a 1% increase in total revenues to $2.7 billion and continuing adjusted EPS in the $0.94 to $0.98 range. This forecast does include $0.03 of net dilution from the Godwin and Canberra acquisition. It also excludes about $0.02 from the discontinued Defense CAS business. It should be noted that this forecast also reflects a reallocation of our second half Defense revenues based on current customer delivery schedules. So this results in a Defense third quarter revenue forecast that is down 5% versus the prior year. 
The Fluid third quarter organic growth forecast is 5% and Motion is 16%. Q3 segment margin performance also reflects higher FX, material costs and investments when compared to Q2.
For the full year, Defense organic revenue growth is expected to be flat compared to the prior year. That's due to revised timing of orders and customer fielding plans. Total Fluid revenue growth was increased to 6%, while full year organic results are expected to be flat due to some additional slowing in Europe and the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange. Motion & Flow Control's total revenue growth guidance was raised to 14% and organic revenue was increased to 18% from 7% due to improved conditions across all major end markets served.
2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 3% in total and 2% organically to $11 billion. This forecast excludes approximately $240 million of discontinued cash revenue. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.5% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions. The full year operating margin performance is 60 basis points better than the prior year.
So now let's turn things over to Tom, and let's begin the Q&A.

And we're expecting similar book-to-bills as we had in prior years. So you add all that up, and it does confirm, as Scott just referred to, this sort of long-term Defense forecast that we gave you before. Despite these pressures that we're seeing on the core budgets, we're nicely offsetting those with the adjacency wins in new customers. So that's why we are maintaining our long-term forecast to say, we'll be in the low- to mid-single digits kind of growth, and we expect the 2011 to be another solid year for Defense. The other thing you have to keep in mind there on the question, Jeff, is that a big component of our backlog is services, and the very nature of the services business is that actually is a fairly short-cycle backlog program. So that's why our book-to-bill is probably a little bit higher than that of the industry average.

Some of it is due to seasonality, some of it also is due to radios and jammers that we're going to be delivering. We also see recovery on the IP side of the business, which will be a positive for us. Now offsetting that slightly is we've got some of Motion Technologies and not having the stimulus program in Europe. But we see revenues overall benefiting us by roughly about 10 basis points. We also have very, very strong productivity when we look at second half versus first half. So we're going to be up nicely with productivity. Foreign exchange is impacting us by about 20 basis points. And then when we look at the investments that we outlined at the beginning of the year, we said that we were going to be making incremental investments in our business, primarily on the Fluid side and in Motion & Flow. We're keeping to that, and it's that the fact that the investments are tending to be more heavily weighted in the second half versus the first half of the year. So we're seeing that dynamic taking place also.

The three major dynamics that are occurring in this economy is, you're seeing an impact of foreign exchange. We do have changes in incremental investments, which we believe are appropriate for the long term, particularly to position more strongly in emerging markets. And we do have the municipal pressure in Europe, as we mentioned. And in some cases, quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing changes in the IP business. So those factors somewhat cloud the long-term story in Fluid Technology, which is to say that we are exceptionally well positioned with our cost base. We're seeing a very, very nice order growth, which once we get past some of these shorter-cycle phenomenons, we should be able to leverage very, very nicely on the top line. So as we're just now in the process of detailing the 2011 plan, we are expecting strong organic growth out of this platform and strong margin expansion. And I think what we're seeing here this year is a lot of short-cycle volatility, somewhat driven by the economic recovery that we're all well aware of.

And those investments are around the emerging markets, it's around the front-end processes with our commercial excellence program, and it's around new technologies and new products. If you back out those incremental investments, you would actually see fluid margins operationally growing 250 basis points.

Cadence is determined not by the magnitude of the pipeline, but a combination of action, ability and timing, and then ultimately, valuation. So as you know, it's always hard to be predictive in that area. But I would say we're going to try to stay on this pace. But it's always hard to predict how it's going to come out. With respect to aerospace, aerospace is an attractive area. And despite the fact that it is a little slow right now, as you all know, we do see it long term. I have not mentioned that recently simply because our pipeline is so strong in the other areas which are equally attractive. But aerospace is an area that I would say falls into attractive, but it's not in the front of our pipeline at this point in time. 
Well, Nigel, I want to thank you for your questions and thank everyone for your interest. And let me just close very quickly, and first of all, apologize for the timing delay, we'll get that fixed. But the highlights, as we're thinking about it is that we did have a solid second quarter, beating expectations, and we're raising the full year operating outlook. And we're proud of the fact that we've offseted the impacts of this portfolio positioning. We do continue to see strong productivity across every one of our business segments. We're excited, quite frankly, about the strong performance in the short-cycle Motion & Flow Control business. And despite some of these headwinds, which Denise just covered, the longer-cycle commercial businesses continue to deliver very strong order growth, which is setting us up for a strong revenue and earnings year in the Fluid Technology business next year.
The diversified Defense business continues to overcome budget pressures in the core product areas because we've been very successfully diversifying this customer base. And the portfolio strategy, the rebalance is working, having just added $1 billion investment to the base. So as I think about where we are, this business model at ITT is designed to perform well over time. And our track record over the past several years validates the merits of this business model design. We work really hard to align to essential and attractive segments of enduring global needs. We execute well with exceptional strategic management processes, and we spend a lot of time to drive a very significant differential reallocation strategies to optimize our opportunity. And this all works because underneath, we have great people and great leadership, with a very strong underlying value system. And this combination is really a magic elixir for employee engagement, innovation and customer loyalty.
So in the midst of a lot of concerns in this economic time, let me point out that even in light of a highly unstabilized and volatile global economy and with the pressures we understand the Defense budget, in 2010, ITT will surpass our record 2008 performance by delivering an 11% adjusted growth off the strongest 2009 EPS performance in our peer group. So we're turning in yet another record year of earnings performance while we are rebalancing this portfolio and powering through quite successfully a volatile economic period. So I just wanted to close on a high note, we're proud about what we have accomplished, and we look forward to catching up with you on the next quarter. Thank you very much.

Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our attractive portfolio produces consistent and reliable results time and time again. This strong performance reflects our intense focus, as always, on strategic execution. And in this quarter again we saw some top-notch operating results by teams all across ITT, and it wasn't easy. Our focused productivity and cost management programs more than offset external headwinds, including some significant volatility in commodity pricing and foreign exchange. 
We saw some very strong organic growth in our Fluid Technology and Motion & Flow Control businesses where our markets continue to strengthen across the majority of our product segments and geographic regions. We're extremely pleased with the prior investments that we've made in emerging markets where we continue to see great results, in fact, growing 22% in the quarter, and of course we're expected to maintain strong growth rates in emerging markets for the next several years. 
In our Defense & Information Solutions business, we saw a 25% improvement in orders. And in addition, we recently generated several key strategic wins that validate ITT leadership position in a number of important programs. For example, in early October, we were awarded a $1.4 billion contract to provide comprehensive support services for all U.S. Army facilities in Kuwait. And this represents the fourth major facilities operations contract awarded ITT in 2010, and it solidifies our role as a premier provider of base operation services in the Middle East. 
In the third quarter, ITT was also recognized as a leading provider of space-based imaging payloads, winning two very important contracts to build next-generation imaging systems that are going to serve commercial and government markets. Our technologies will ultimately support imaging programs for both DigitalGlobe and GeoEye. And as a leading provider of electronic countermeasures, we've also won several pivotal 2010 awards for both ground and airborne jamming capabilities. This includes CREW 3.2 and  CREW 3.3 programs and the development technology under the Next Generation Jammer program for the Naval Air Systems Command. 
Our ongoing strategy to further align our business portfolio with macro trend is progressing very, very nicely. We're expanding in air traffic management, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made in the Fluid Technology business, notably in the Analytics business and the Godwin Pump businesses, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Another point of specific pride in the quarter is the nice accretion that we're already seeing from these 2010 acquisitions.
And so all of these execution and this performance and program wins gives us great confidence in increasing our guidance for the full year. We're on track to deliver $4.30 per share in 2010, which represents a 15% increase in full year adjusted EPS. And that's another record performance for ITT. In fact, a performance that follows the best in class results in 2009, and it handily tops our prior record during the 2008 pre-economic crisis period where our EPS was $3.99. Our performance is even more notable when you consider these growth rates are being achieved while we're also investing in our future. 
As you know, we take a long-term approach to sustainable, predictable growth. And in 2010, we are elected to reinvest the equivalent of six EPS points of growth into incremental investments for our future, the third straight year of incremental investments to an already strong base. These investments are in all attractive growth areas such as air traffic management, emerging market expansion, product innovation, our defense adjacency, diversity strategy and analytical instrumentation. Absent those critical investments which are already benefiting our bottom line, our 2010 earnings would actually be on track for some 21% growth.
So simply put, we believe our quarterly results and the full year outlook demonstrate that this portfolio continues to produce solid results. And now let's turn things over to Denise to review the financials."
280322,114543695,83369,"ITT Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.Third quarter revenues were flat as the",2679,"Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.
Third quarter revenues were flat as the growth of 17% at Motion and 11% at Fluid nicely offset the 9% decline at Defense. Organic revenue grew 3% at Fluid due to strength in both the U.S. and the European municipal markets, and Motion continue to deliver stellar organic results, growing 22% with double-digit improvement in all of those businesses.  Defense's results included anticipated declines in CREW 2.1 and U.S. SINCGARS. 
So total organic orders in the quarter were extremely strong, and we are particularly pleased that the 18% improvement included growth at every one of our 10 value centers. Defense orders doubled compared to the second quarter and improved 25% compared to the prior year. Motion orders were strong at 20%, and Fluid orders were solid at 5%. 
Segment operating income exceeded expectations, declining 3% to $339 million. Exceptional operating productivity in the quarter contributed 100 basis points to the margin improvement. In total, margins declined 40 basis points due to negative foreign exchange, higher pension and a 60 basis point increase in incremental growth investments. 
During the quarter and throughout all of 2010, we've continued to make incremental investments in key growth platforms, including oil and gas, energy efficiency and emerging market expansion. And as just a reminder, we do include a chart in the appendix that provides a nice walk of our margin performance drivers versus the prior year.
Lastly, our third quarter adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 6% to $1.8 due to solid operating performances, lower corporate expenses and a favorable tax rate. In addition, our 2010 acquisitions were $0.02 accretive in the quarter, and that includes the impact of purchase accounting. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a record $4.30, which puts us on track to deliver a 15% improvement compared to 2009, which as you'll recall was a year of best in class adjusted EPS performance for ITT in a difficult macro environment. And as Steve indicated earlier, included in this forecasted 15% EPS growth are about six points of incremental investments that we made during 2010 to support our future growth.
Turning to our financial position on Slide 5. Our consistently strong financial position is built on a legacy of strong free cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, and these hallmarks of our performance are reflected once again in our third quarter results. The solid third quarter net debt to net capital ratio of 14.4% incorporates continued investment in organic growth platforms, such as the U.S. nationwide build out of FAA ADS-B air traffic management system. 
The ratio also reflects the net funding of the 2010 portfolio alignment action with the acquisitions of Godwin, Nova and Canberra. And at quarter end, we still have more than $900 million in cash. Year-to-date free cash flow of $480 million was nicely ahead of our internal expectations due to stronger operating results, and we now expect to exceed our full year free cash flow conversion target of 100%. 
Now let's take a look at Fluid Technology's third quarter results, turn to Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 11% to $920 million. Our successful 2010 acquisitions contributed $87 million of incremental revenue. And keep in mind, we just closed the Godwin transaction this August. Foreign exchange cost of revenue headwind of about 2%, so excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic revenue improved 3%. 
We are particularly pleased to see that Water & Wastewater grew 6% organically and 24% in total. The results exceeded our expectations due to stronger demand across global municipal markets. For example, U.S. and Asian municipal markets delivered double-digit growth, and we were very pleased to see that the pace of activity in parts of Europe added some nice growth to the quarter.
The revenue performances of the newly acquired Analytics and Godwin businesses were simply extraordinary, immediately validating the strategic fit with ITT and the strong demand drivers in those markets served. 
Residential and Commercial Water delivered a third straight quarter of organic growth growing 4% in Q3 and organic revenue and industrial process declined 5% due to lower industrial project deliveries that were partially offset by strength in Latin American mining. However, IP's organic orders continue to be very strong, growing 12% with improvement in each of the seven primary end markets served.
Fluid operating income grew 7%, operating productivity improved 200 basis points, and these improvements reflect the structural benefit of prior aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that have repeatedly offset cost inflation and mix without the benefit of significant volume expansion.  In total, operating margins declined 50 basis points due to increased strategic investment and negative foreign exchange.
Total fluid organic orders grew 5% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio exceeded one due to double-digit growth at industrial process and Residential and Commercial Water. 
For the fourth quarter, we're now forecasting Fluid organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. This growth will be driven by a recovery in the late cycle Industrial Process business and continued stability in the municipal markets. Our full year 2010 organic growth forecast has now improved from flat to 1%, and the strong acquisition results have further driven our total fluid revenue growth forecast from 6% to 8%.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, and lets review another exceptionally strong quarter for Motion & Flow. Motion's organic revenue growth of 22% exceeded 20% for a third straight quarter. And keep in mind that this 2010 strength follows a decline of only 14% in 2009, which as you know was pretty good, comparatively speaking. The Q3 segment strength continue to be broad-based, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. And emerging market results were particularly strong. They increased 50%. The strong revenue growth was lead by Interconnect Solutions with a 37% improvement due to strong demand across most end markets. Motion Tech exceeded expectations for the quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 19% on stronger OEM deliveries from recent platform wins. 
Now exiting Q2, we expected to see a meaningful Q3 slowing from the expiration of the European auto stimulus. But clearly, it didn't happen in the quarter and we're now expecting to see that flowing in the fourth quarter. Motion & Flow Control's operating income improved 13%. Operating productivity improved 50 basis points. However, margins declined 50 basis points in total due to higher investment, FX and pension.
Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 20%, with all businesses contributing double-digit growth. As a result of our strong year-to-date performances and the positive demand indicators, we are maintaining Motion & Flow Control's 18% organic revenue forecast for 2010. This implies a 3% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. Now the deceleration is mainly caused by an anticipated slowing in the European automotive market after the expiration of the stimulus benefit. Excluding this impact on Motion Tech, the balance of the motion businesses are expected to grow in the mid-teens organically in Q4.
Now let's turn to Defense, which is on Slide 8. While not always evident in the quarterly results, our Defense team has continued to aggressively position itself for the future through key strategic wins, customer diversification and transformational performances. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 9%. This decline primarily reflected lower activity on software engineering service contracts, anticipated declines in U.S. SINCGARS in CREW 2.1 and some night-vision and jammer delivery delays on firm orders that just moved into Q4. 
In the quarter, we did see nice revenue growth from air traffic management activities, special purpose jammers, radar equipment and composite structures.  Strong third quarter operating margins of 13% reflected operating productivity of 50 basis points, derived from the Defense transformation and strong contract execution. In total, margins declined 30 basis points, largely due to higher pension expenses. 
Turning to orders, we were very pleased with the strong organic growth delivered by each Defense business. Q3 orders were 100% better than Q2 and 25% better than the prior year. Geospatial orders improved 53% due to strong demand for our commercial imaging satellite payloads. Electronic Systems orders improved 34%. This included a SINCGARS orders for Iraq under the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program. Now you may recall in the second quarter we reduced our forecast because of the challenges associated with executing a direct sale to Iraq. So we're very pleased with the progress our team made to transform a portion of these opportunity into a U.S. FMF order. 
Lastly, information systems grew 8% due to increased activity on the FAA ADS-B program and the U.S. Army Prepositioned Stock program in Kuwait. For the full year, we maintained our forecast of $6 billion in Defense revenue. This forecast includes strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4, and the main drivers of the incremental performance are some recently awarded international SINCGARS FMF contracts including Iraq, Taiwan and Bahrain, increased activity under the new Afghanistan Army Corps contract, incremental jammer shipments and recovered Q3 production delays.
Turn to Slide 9. We've added a summary of some different backlog metrics to help provide additional perspective on the future opportunities that our Defense team is winning today. And in recent years, we have seen some changing dynamics that are driving variation in our order intake patterns and backlog statistics. Today, we have a much more diversified customer mix than we've ever had. Nearly 25% of our customer base is outside of the U.S. Armed Services budget, and these new customers including international customers follow unique new order patterns. In addition, we no longer expect to see large block orders for surged products like CREW and SINCGARS that have been ramping down for a couple of years now. So these factors add to the volatility of our quarterly metrics. 
In addition, we're seeing an increase in protest activities from incumbent, especially for those large multiyear contracts. These protests may delay the recognition of orders in revenue and complicate our ability to forecast outcomes. And lastly, we believe that customers may reduce funding levels and frequencies in response to current budgetary pressures. Keep in mind that our current calculation for funded backlog include orders that have been authorized and appropriated for funding by the customer. 
In Q3, our funded backlog increased to $4.3 billion, represented a $175 million increase from Q2 levels. The ultimate 2010 backlog will largely be determined by the timing and the duration of funding for large service contracts that we've already won.
As a result of the changing customer mix I described, we are also seeing increased service revenues. This increase reduces our sales to backlog ratios because service contracts and even multiyear one, typically fund in periods ranging from three to nine months increment. Also keep in mind that services represent about 40% of our revenues, and that's relatively high compared to many of our defense peers.
So as a result of the factors discussed above, we're providing an estimate of our funded and unfunded awards. This combined calculation totals over $10 billion. The funded and unfunded calculation is not intended to be a replacement for the funded backlog metrics. But we will periodically provide this information to show the aggregate size of the opportunity pipeline in our Defense segment. We've also listed five recent key wins that further demonstrate the strategic strength and diversity of our Defense segment. These all reflect the magnitude of the impact that the changing dynamics in our business are having on our backlog statistics.
In total, the awards listed here represent $4.8 billion of potential future value, and they are all excluded from both our funded and unfunded calculations. The first two multiyear service award totaling $2.7 billion are excluded because they are currently being protested by incumbents. We also excluded potential orders under three recent major IDIQ awards, totaling $2 billion. We won a $1.4 billion SE2020 air traffic management IDIQ award from the FAA. And we won two important IDIQ award for critical next-generation technologies from the U.S. Armed Services. $455 million for CREW 3.2 Jammer capabilities and $260 million for enhanced night vision goggles. 
So in summary, while the ultimate outcome of some of these awards remains uncertain, we are certain that our Defense business is very well positioned to continue to generate solid return on investment and cash flows in the future. Despite the difficult budgetary environment, this Defense team is clearly continuing to win the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we had two major special events, the annual asbestos update, and the gain on the sale of CAS, the Defense sit of business. So here's an overview of those two items and how they impact our reported results. The asbestos liability update announced today is part of our normal annual accounting process, designed to ensure that our asbestos liability reflects the most current information available to us. Future annual liability updates could involve increases or decreases, and we can't predict the direction or magnitude of future changes. We believe that our process in rolling ten-year model that we used to estimate our probable future asbestos expenses and related third-party recoveries is consistent with best  practices in the industry.
In the third quarter, we are increasing our asbestos liability with a related after-tax charge to continuing operations of $204 million or $1.10 per share. Now this charge has been categorized as a special item in the quarter, and is not reflected in our adjusted EPS results or projections. The increase in the liability reflects more recent data that points to higher expected net cost over the next 10 years, including increased settlement values in the last year. We've also seen significantly increased activity in several higher cost jurisdictions, increasing the number of cases to be actively litigated and increasing expected legal costs.
In contrast to an approach that's used by other companies, we do include estimated future defense costs in our estimate of future liabilities. It is important to note that the average projected net annual pretax cash flow impact of future asbestos payment is $25 million per year for the next five years and $50 million to $60 million over the remaining years of the projection period. We do not, at this time, expect a material impact on our free cash flow over the next 10 years. The other special event in the third quarter was the recognition of after-tax benefits of $152 million or $0.82 per share, associated with the divestiture of CAS.
So now let's turn to our adjusted EPS guidance, and that's on Slide 11. Based on our strong year-to-date performances, the strength of our acquisitions and solid end-market demand, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance midpoint to $4.30, 15% higher than 2009. We've tightened the range to $4.28 to $4.32 to better reflect our expectations for the full year. The $0.17 guidance midpoint increase includes the $0.12 of incremental Q3 performance and incremental Q4 performances of $0.05. Now big driver of the increase is the positive contribution from the successful 2010 acquisition that we're initially expected to be $0.04 dilutive, but they're now expected to be $0.03 accretive. Strong operating performances and favorable corporate results account for the balance of the increase.
2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 4% in total and 2% organically to $11.1 billion. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.6% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisition. The full year operating margin performance is 70 basis points better than the prior year. 
So in summary, 2010 has been a year of tremendous progress for ITT. We're improving our portfolio alignment. We're investing in future growth platforms and we're delivering premier earnings growth once again. So now I'm going to turn it over to Tom, and we will start the Q&A."

So that gives us a lot of capabilities when we first acquired these businesses to be able to get incremental value out of them. These were very high quality assets that we bought. They were very good companies. And what we've seen is we have seen some strong end-market demand, particularly with Godwin on the Dewatering side.

And I think the teams have been very cautious on the cost of integration. We make certain assumptions in our model when we make the acquisition to tie into appropriate valuation. But I think the teams have really done a very good job of not adding any additional cost for acquisition integration that was necessary. So all in, I think we've had a lot of practice in the last several years and we're getting better at it."

We're not focused on size per se, we're focused on strategy, and what we want is to create value as an example of the recent OI and SRA type acquisitions are relatively small. And we've got a couple of other relatively small acquisitions that are just giving us a very, very nice suite of technology. I can go back and point to acquisitions we did with Allen Osbourne, with Insight, with Dolphin, those were all small-scale acquisitions. But as an example, a couple of those we're central to our ability to deliver the miniature soldier radio wave form and other secure GPS technology as adjuncts to our jamming and communications. So those are the kind of things that really give us a lot of benefit in the marketplace. So Jim, it really is a wide landscape."

I just wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question and maybe this isn't a platform for this question but I'm not sure when we're going to talk again.It's been a relatively frustrating year from a stock performance perspective, and obviously, the elephant in the room is the Defense business. I think a lot of people out there continue to believe that this business is just facing massive secular headwinds over the next couple of years, and you see it in all the Defense multiples. And sure enough all the defense companies this quarter like General Dynamics missing its revenue guidance, but the margins are better than expected, not really getting credit for that. You guys talked about the acquisitions you're executing on the big pipeline. It seems to me like you're kind of setting us up for running acquisitions. But at what stage do you get frustrated with the degree of misunderstanding at a portfolio and do something a little more aggressive on the portfolio management side, maybe lever the company up buyback a ton of stock? You've done a very good job with the card you've been dealt over the last six or seven years, Steve. And I'm just wondering at what point do you get frustrated with the street view that just seems like no matter how much you explain the diversity and the growth potential of this Defense business, it just doesn't seem to me that you're going to be able to get out of this rut over the next year or so. So I'm just curious as to what level of frustration you guys have over there in the board room?"

What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve,",606,"I think one can never get frustrated in this business. What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve, to the point of your question, there is more concern about our Defense business in the street than we believe is appropriate. There is no question that some pieces of our Defense business are under stress. I think we're being extremely transparent about that. But at the end of the day, we're going to continue to communicate the reasons why we think the Defense component is a strong and robust component. Let me just review some top-level statistics with you. If you take a look at the $700-ish billion dollar top-level market that we think about in Defense, Secretary Gates has already articulated that he's going to drive around $100 billion of productivity through efficiency in the acquisition process and other cost elimination. When you take that efficiency through the budgets and recognize that just slightly over half of the budget is the piece of the budget that we really, really like and that we really want to preserve and Secretary Gates really wants to preserve, which is the operation and maintenance in the RDT and the yearly investment equipment side of the budget. The current DoD plan is to hold that essentially flat, in fact it's flat to up 1%. That's the place that we play. So the first thing you have to understand is that in the market segments where we play, the Secretary in Defense and everyone else is trying to drive this efficiency that you are all hear about to actually preserve the budget component that's the sort of non-logistics, non-personnel and non-transactional piece of the business. So that's actually good news. Now obviously, as it becomes a deficit a based impact on the  budget, that would certainly be the wild card. But the fact is, is that where we play is expected to be relatively constant with the plan. And then the next thing you have to do is you have to go in and look at what pieces of the budget actually are growing and which ones are most susceptible. Clearly, platforms are more susceptible than the C4 I squared R [ph] which is really the intelligence piece of control, communications, surveillance and electronic capability, which as you know is the bulk of where we play. And so the market segment where we're playing, we think, are actually going to be slightly positive. When you take a bigger picture perspective and you take a look at the segments of the business, the segments of the whole government business that are going to grow the most or go down the most, you're going to see the FAA and the cyber and IT components are expected to be strong single-digits growth, 6% to 8% growth in this environment. So maybe, Steve, what I'm doing is I'm essentially repeating the point of the question. Our Defense business is growing very, very nicely in these adjacencies. And so at the end of the day, I think we've got a strong position. That's why we talked with you about the backlog. And in that regard, that's how we feel about Defense. We think it's a strong business. And even though we understand your concerns in terms on the street, in terms of cyclical, secular issues, we think we've got a strong Defense business in the future. We're going to continue to compete in our core markets."

I think the operating income number to your question is going to be proportional to the amount of actual revenue opportunity, revenue growth that we have. So we'll continue to be working the operating income. That will obviously be under pressure as sales tend to be in the flattish range as we go through this transformational mix into the Defense budget.

Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our attractive portfolio produces consistent and reliable results time and time again. This strong performance reflects our intense focus, as always, on strategic execution. And in this quarter again we saw some top-notch operating results by teams all across ITT, and it wasn't easy. Our focused productivity and cost management programs more than offset external headwinds, including some significant volatility in commodity pricing and foreign exchange. 
We saw some very strong organic growth in our Fluid Technology and Motion & Flow Control businesses where our markets continue to strengthen across the majority of our product segments and geographic regions. We're extremely pleased with the prior investments that we've made in emerging markets where we continue to see great results, in fact, growing 22% in the quarter, and of course we're expected to maintain strong growth rates in emerging markets for the next several years. 
In our Defense & Information Solutions business, we saw a 25% improvement in orders. And in addition, we recently generated several key strategic wins that validate ITT leadership position in a number of important programs. For example, in early October, we were awarded a $1.4 billion contract to provide comprehensive support services for all U.S. Army facilities in Kuwait. And this represents the fourth major facilities operations contract awarded ITT in 2010, and it solidifies our role as a premier provider of base operation services in the Middle East. 
In the third quarter, ITT was also recognized as a leading provider of space-based imaging payloads, winning two very important contracts to build next-generation imaging systems that are going to serve commercial and government markets. Our technologies will ultimately support imaging programs for both DigitalGlobe and GeoEye. And as a leading provider of electronic countermeasures, we've also won several pivotal 2010 awards for both ground and airborne jamming capabilities. This includes CREW 3.2 and  CREW 3.3 programs and the development technology under the Next Generation Jammer program for the Naval Air Systems Command. 
Our ongoing strategy to further align our business portfolio with macro trend is progressing very, very nicely. We're expanding in air traffic management, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made in the Fluid Technology business, notably in the Analytics business and the Godwin Pump businesses, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Another point of specific pride in the quarter is the nice accretion that we're already seeing from these 2010 acquisitions.
And so all of these execution and this performance and program wins gives us great confidence in increasing our guidance for the full year. We're on track to deliver $4.30 per share in 2010, which represents a 15% increase in full year adjusted EPS. And that's another record performance for ITT. In fact, a performance that follows the best in class results in 2009, and it handily tops our prior record during the 2008 pre-economic crisis period where our EPS was $3.99. Our performance is even more notable when you consider these growth rates are being achieved while we're also investing in our future. 
As you know, we take a long-term approach to sustainable, predictable growth. And in 2010, we are elected to reinvest the equivalent of six EPS points of growth into incremental investments for our future, the third straight year of incremental investments to an already strong base. These investments are in all attractive growth areas such as air traffic management, emerging market expansion, product innovation, our defense adjacency, diversity strategy and analytical instrumentation. Absent those critical investments which are already benefiting our bottom line, our 2010 earnings would actually be on track for some 21% growth.
So simply put, we believe our quarterly results and the full year outlook demonstrate that this portfolio continues to produce solid results. And now let's turn things over to Denise to review the financials.
"
280322,114543695,83397,"ITT Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.Third quarter revenues were flat as the",2679,"Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.
Third quarter revenues were flat as the growth of 17% at Motion and 11% at Fluid nicely offset the 9% decline at Defense. Organic revenue grew 3% at Fluid due to strength in both the U.S. and the European municipal markets, and Motion continue to deliver stellar organic results, growing 22% with double-digit improvement in all of those businesses.  Defense's results included anticipated declines in CREW 2.1 and U.S. SINCGARS. 
So total organic orders in the quarter were extremely strong, and we are particularly pleased that the 18% improvement included growth at every one of our 10 value centers. Defense orders doubled compared to the second quarter and improved 25% compared to the prior year. Motion orders were strong at 20%, and Fluid orders were solid at 5%. 
Segment operating income exceeded expectations, declining 3% to $339 million. Exceptional operating productivity in the quarter contributed 100 basis points to the margin improvement. In total, margins declined 40 basis points due to negative foreign exchange, higher pension and a 60 basis point increase in incremental growth investments. 
During the quarter and throughout all of 2010, we've continued to make incremental investments in key growth platforms, including oil and gas, energy efficiency and emerging market expansion. And as just a reminder, we do include a chart in the appendix that provides a nice walk of our margin performance drivers versus the prior year.
Lastly, our third quarter adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 6% to $1.8 due to solid operating performances, lower corporate expenses and a favorable tax rate. In addition, our 2010 acquisitions were $0.02 accretive in the quarter, and that includes the impact of purchase accounting. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a record $4.30, which puts us on track to deliver a 15% improvement compared to 2009, which as you'll recall was a year of best in class adjusted EPS performance for ITT in a difficult macro environment. And as Steve indicated earlier, included in this forecasted 15% EPS growth are about six points of incremental investments that we made during 2010 to support our future growth.
Turning to our financial position on Slide 5. Our consistently strong financial position is built on a legacy of strong free cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, and these hallmarks of our performance are reflected once again in our third quarter results. The solid third quarter net debt to net capital ratio of 14.4% incorporates continued investment in organic growth platforms, such as the U.S. nationwide build out of FAA ADS-B air traffic management system. 
The ratio also reflects the net funding of the 2010 portfolio alignment action with the acquisitions of Godwin, Nova and Canberra. And at quarter end, we still have more than $900 million in cash. Year-to-date free cash flow of $480 million was nicely ahead of our internal expectations due to stronger operating results, and we now expect to exceed our full year free cash flow conversion target of 100%. 
Now let's take a look at Fluid Technology's third quarter results, turn to Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 11% to $920 million. Our successful 2010 acquisitions contributed $87 million of incremental revenue. And keep in mind, we just closed the Godwin transaction this August. Foreign exchange cost of revenue headwind of about 2%, so excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic revenue improved 3%. 
We are particularly pleased to see that Water & Wastewater grew 6% organically and 24% in total. The results exceeded our expectations due to stronger demand across global municipal markets. For example, U.S. and Asian municipal markets delivered double-digit growth, and we were very pleased to see that the pace of activity in parts of Europe added some nice growth to the quarter.
The revenue performances of the newly acquired Analytics and Godwin businesses were simply extraordinary, immediately validating the strategic fit with ITT and the strong demand drivers in those markets served. 
Residential and Commercial Water delivered a third straight quarter of organic growth growing 4% in Q3 and organic revenue and industrial process declined 5% due to lower industrial project deliveries that were partially offset by strength in Latin American mining. However, IP's organic orders continue to be very strong, growing 12% with improvement in each of the seven primary end markets served.
Fluid operating income grew 7%, operating productivity improved 200 basis points, and these improvements reflect the structural benefit of prior aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that have repeatedly offset cost inflation and mix without the benefit of significant volume expansion.  In total, operating margins declined 50 basis points due to increased strategic investment and negative foreign exchange.
Total fluid organic orders grew 5% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio exceeded one due to double-digit growth at industrial process and Residential and Commercial Water. 
For the fourth quarter, we're now forecasting Fluid organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. This growth will be driven by a recovery in the late cycle Industrial Process business and continued stability in the municipal markets. Our full year 2010 organic growth forecast has now improved from flat to 1%, and the strong acquisition results have further driven our total fluid revenue growth forecast from 6% to 8%.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, and lets review another exceptionally strong quarter for Motion & Flow. Motion's organic revenue growth of 22% exceeded 20% for a third straight quarter. And keep in mind that this 2010 strength follows a decline of only 14% in 2009, which as you know was pretty good, comparatively speaking. The Q3 segment strength continue to be broad-based, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. And emerging market results were particularly strong. They increased 50%. The strong revenue growth was lead by Interconnect Solutions with a 37% improvement due to strong demand across most end markets. Motion Tech exceeded expectations for the quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 19% on stronger OEM deliveries from recent platform wins. 
Now exiting Q2, we expected to see a meaningful Q3 slowing from the expiration of the European auto stimulus. But clearly, it didn't happen in the quarter and we're now expecting to see that flowing in the fourth quarter. Motion & Flow Control's operating income improved 13%. Operating productivity improved 50 basis points. However, margins declined 50 basis points in total due to higher investment, FX and pension.
Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 20%, with all businesses contributing double-digit growth. As a result of our strong year-to-date performances and the positive demand indicators, we are maintaining Motion & Flow Control's 18% organic revenue forecast for 2010. This implies a 3% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. Now the deceleration is mainly caused by an anticipated slowing in the European automotive market after the expiration of the stimulus benefit. Excluding this impact on Motion Tech, the balance of the motion businesses are expected to grow in the mid-teens organically in Q4.
Now let's turn to Defense, which is on Slide 8. While not always evident in the quarterly results, our Defense team has continued to aggressively position itself for the future through key strategic wins, customer diversification and transformational performances. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 9%. This decline primarily reflected lower activity on software engineering service contracts, anticipated declines in U.S. SINCGARS in CREW 2.1 and some night-vision and jammer delivery delays on firm orders that just moved into Q4. 
In the quarter, we did see nice revenue growth from air traffic management activities, special purpose jammers, radar equipment and composite structures.  Strong third quarter operating margins of 13% reflected operating productivity of 50 basis points, derived from the Defense transformation and strong contract execution. In total, margins declined 30 basis points, largely due to higher pension expenses. 
Turning to orders, we were very pleased with the strong organic growth delivered by each Defense business. Q3 orders were 100% better than Q2 and 25% better than the prior year. Geospatial orders improved 53% due to strong demand for our commercial imaging satellite payloads. Electronic Systems orders improved 34%. This included a SINCGARS orders for Iraq under the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program. Now you may recall in the second quarter we reduced our forecast because of the challenges associated with executing a direct sale to Iraq. So we're very pleased with the progress our team made to transform a portion of these opportunity into a U.S. FMF order. 
Lastly, information systems grew 8% due to increased activity on the FAA ADS-B program and the U.S. Army Prepositioned Stock program in Kuwait. For the full year, we maintained our forecast of $6 billion in Defense revenue. This forecast includes strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4, and the main drivers of the incremental performance are some recently awarded international SINCGARS FMF contracts including Iraq, Taiwan and Bahrain, increased activity under the new Afghanistan Army Corps contract, incremental jammer shipments and recovered Q3 production delays.
Turn to Slide 9. We've added a summary of some different backlog metrics to help provide additional perspective on the future opportunities that our Defense team is winning today. And in recent years, we have seen some changing dynamics that are driving variation in our order intake patterns and backlog statistics. Today, we have a much more diversified customer mix than we've ever had. Nearly 25% of our customer base is outside of the U.S. Armed Services budget, and these new customers including international customers follow unique new order patterns. In addition, we no longer expect to see large block orders for surged products like CREW and SINCGARS that have been ramping down for a couple of years now. So these factors add to the volatility of our quarterly metrics. 
In addition, we're seeing an increase in protest activities from incumbent, especially for those large multiyear contracts. These protests may delay the recognition of orders in revenue and complicate our ability to forecast outcomes. And lastly, we believe that customers may reduce funding levels and frequencies in response to current budgetary pressures. Keep in mind that our current calculation for funded backlog include orders that have been authorized and appropriated for funding by the customer. 
In Q3, our funded backlog increased to $4.3 billion, represented a $175 million increase from Q2 levels. The ultimate 2010 backlog will largely be determined by the timing and the duration of funding for large service contracts that we've already won.
As a result of the changing customer mix I described, we are also seeing increased service revenues. This increase reduces our sales to backlog ratios because service contracts and even multiyear one, typically fund in periods ranging from three to nine months increment. Also keep in mind that services represent about 40% of our revenues, and that's relatively high compared to many of our defense peers.
So as a result of the factors discussed above, we're providing an estimate of our funded and unfunded awards. This combined calculation totals over $10 billion. The funded and unfunded calculation is not intended to be a replacement for the funded backlog metrics. But we will periodically provide this information to show the aggregate size of the opportunity pipeline in our Defense segment. We've also listed five recent key wins that further demonstrate the strategic strength and diversity of our Defense segment. These all reflect the magnitude of the impact that the changing dynamics in our business are having on our backlog statistics.
In total, the awards listed here represent $4.8 billion of potential future value, and they are all excluded from both our funded and unfunded calculations. The first two multiyear service award totaling $2.7 billion are excluded because they are currently being protested by incumbents. We also excluded potential orders under three recent major IDIQ awards, totaling $2 billion. We won a $1.4 billion SE2020 air traffic management IDIQ award from the FAA. And we won two important IDIQ award for critical next-generation technologies from the U.S. Armed Services. $455 million for CREW 3.2 Jammer capabilities and $260 million for enhanced night vision goggles. 
So in summary, while the ultimate outcome of some of these awards remains uncertain, we are certain that our Defense business is very well positioned to continue to generate solid return on investment and cash flows in the future. Despite the difficult budgetary environment, this Defense team is clearly continuing to win the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we had two major special events, the annual asbestos update, and the gain on the sale of CAS, the Defense sit of business. So here's an overview of those two items and how they impact our reported results. The asbestos liability update announced today is part of our normal annual accounting process, designed to ensure that our asbestos liability reflects the most current information available to us. Future annual liability updates could involve increases or decreases, and we can't predict the direction or magnitude of future changes. We believe that our process in rolling ten-year model that we used to estimate our probable future asbestos expenses and related third-party recoveries is consistent with best  practices in the industry.
In the third quarter, we are increasing our asbestos liability with a related after-tax charge to continuing operations of $204 million or $1.10 per share. Now this charge has been categorized as a special item in the quarter, and is not reflected in our adjusted EPS results or projections. The increase in the liability reflects more recent data that points to higher expected net cost over the next 10 years, including increased settlement values in the last year. We've also seen significantly increased activity in several higher cost jurisdictions, increasing the number of cases to be actively litigated and increasing expected legal costs.
In contrast to an approach that's used by other companies, we do include estimated future defense costs in our estimate of future liabilities. It is important to note that the average projected net annual pretax cash flow impact of future asbestos payment is $25 million per year for the next five years and $50 million to $60 million over the remaining years of the projection period. We do not, at this time, expect a material impact on our free cash flow over the next 10 years. The other special event in the third quarter was the recognition of after-tax benefits of $152 million or $0.82 per share, associated with the divestiture of CAS.
So now let's turn to our adjusted EPS guidance, and that's on Slide 11. Based on our strong year-to-date performances, the strength of our acquisitions and solid end-market demand, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance midpoint to $4.30, 15% higher than 2009. We've tightened the range to $4.28 to $4.32 to better reflect our expectations for the full year. The $0.17 guidance midpoint increase includes the $0.12 of incremental Q3 performance and incremental Q4 performances of $0.05. Now big driver of the increase is the positive contribution from the successful 2010 acquisition that we're initially expected to be $0.04 dilutive, but they're now expected to be $0.03 accretive. Strong operating performances and favorable corporate results account for the balance of the increase.
2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 4% in total and 2% organically to $11.1 billion. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.6% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisition. The full year operating margin performance is 70 basis points better than the prior year. 
So in summary, 2010 has been a year of tremendous progress for ITT. We're improving our portfolio alignment. We're investing in future growth platforms and we're delivering premier earnings growth once again. So now I'm going to turn it over to Tom, and we will start the Q&A.

So that gives us a lot of capabilities when we first acquired these businesses to be able to get incremental value out of them. These were very high quality assets that we bought. They were very good companies. And what we've seen is we have seen some strong end-market demand, particularly with Godwin on the Dewatering side.

We're getting some early leverage of the organization, particularly in Fluid Technology, where we're able to leverage the scale of our distribution and selling networks. And I think the teams have been very cautious on the cost of integration. We make certain assumptions in our model when we make the acquisition to tie into appropriate valuation. But I think the teams have really done a very good job of not adding any additional cost for acquisition integration that was necessary. So all in, I think we've had a lot of practice in the last several years and we're getting better at it.

There's a lot of complexity I think is in these outline, but this service mix that has a 60 to 90 day backlog, coupled with diversification and then a lack of some of the block surge orders, and the expansion of the IDIQ makes this metric really less represented, if it's accurate. But it's less represented than it was in times past, which is why we want to show you that we got well over $10 billion of funded and unfunded and coupled with the other major wins while putting it up into the $14 billion, $15 billion range, would suggest that we have already earned an extremely strong opportunity shift. And so when we kind of look at the probability of these things coming in, even with this variation, we do feel good about 2011. We'll have another very nice year on Defense in 2011.

And I think the answer to the question, first of all, validates the capability of the team because we have had a substantial reduction, as you know, in our core businesses in the last couple of years to the tune of $900 million of sales in the higher-margin CREW and SINCGARS business. And that has been offset by this very aggressive adjacency strategy that has, coupled with the defense transformation, actually lays the operating margin. And considering the fact that, that CREW and SINCGARS headwind had actually higher than defense average margin, I think really supports the fact that this team is working it really, really hard. With the transformation that Dave Melcher and the team lead is going to give some nice incremental run rate benefits. They're continuing to do some productivity, and we actually expect to increase some of our restructuring activity in Defense to be able to position for the future. And that's overcoming an additional pension headwind. So all that in, we're going to have about the same margins next day. The Defense team is going to hold the margins about where they are.

The investments that we've made over the years will now start paying a very strong benefit for us in 2011. And then with that top line growth that you're getting, we're expecting to see some very nice flow through into their margin performance.

And as you know, we built 11 all-new facilities in emerging markets, all of which are up and running and being populated. That level of investment is coming down quite a bit. Also in emerging markets, we've also been populating the teams with new application engineers and selling and marketing folks. As an example, three years ago, we had two people in India. Today, we have well over 200 in India, and that's tapering off. That's tapering off right now. We're investing a lot in value-based commercial excellence, which is to upgrade the overall process capability of our selling and front-end on the commercial side of the business. That will taper off a bit. So those are some examples of things that are tapering off. In terms of new product technology, the engineering product development, that's probably going to be about the same, maybe slightly down as some of the new mining and the new residential commercial pump lines are coming to production.

In fact, several thousand salespeople around the world who are accessing municipal and commercial customers. And we will also, to the extent we don't conflict with the distribution channel, we will also be flowing the analytical instrumentation through those channels. So it's the best of both worlds. I should say also that's very similar to our Godwin strategy and it's very similar to the cross-selling strategy we referred to even within our own ITT distribution. And so we're taking advantage of the geographical benefit of this huge selling and distribution network, really, which is second to none in the world. And we're able to offer through this geographic benefit, the transport treatment and CAS technology that gives us the only capability of a comprehensive suite of technology to be able to address these needs.

I just wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question and maybe this isn't a platform for this question but I'm not sure when we're going to talk again.It's been a relatively frustrating year from a stock performance perspective, and obviously, the elephant in the room is the Defense business. I think a lot of people out there continue to believe that this business is just facing massive secular headwinds over the next couple of years, and you see it in all the Defense multiples. And sure enough all the defense companies this quarter like General Dynamics missing its revenue guidance, but the margins are better than expected, not really getting credit for that. You guys talked about the acquisitions you're executing on the big pipeline. It seems to me like you're kind of setting us up for running acquisitions. But at what stage do you get frustrated with the degree of misunderstanding at a portfolio and do something a little more aggressive on the portfolio management side, maybe lever the company up buyback a ton of stock? You've done a very good job with the card you've been dealt over the last six or seven years, Steve. And I'm just wondering at what point do you get frustrated with the street view that just seems like no matter how much you explain the diversity and the growth potential of this Defense business, it just doesn't seem to me that you're going to be able to get out of this rut over the next year or so.

What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the defense business.

What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve, to the point of your question, there is more concern about our Defense business in the street than we believe is appropriate. There is no question that some pieces of our Defense business are under stress. I think we're being extremely transparent about that. But at the end of the day, we're going to continue to communicate the reasons why we think the Defense component is a strong and robust component. Let me just review some top-level statistics with you. If you take a look at the $700-ish billion dollar top-level market that we think about in Defense, Secretary Gates has already articulated that he's going to drive around $100 billion of productivity through efficiency in the acquisition process and other cost elimination. When you take that efficiency through the budgets and recognize that just slightly over half of the budget is the piece of the budget that we really, really like and that we really want to preserve and Secretary Gates really wants to preserve, which is the operation and maintenance in the RDT and the yearly investment equipment side of the budget. The current DoD plan is to hold that essentially flat, in fact it's flat to up 1%. That's the place that we play. So the first thing you have to understand is that in the market segments where we play, the Secretary in Defense and everyone else is trying to drive this efficiency that you are all hear about to actually preserve the budget component that's the sort of non-logistics, non-personnel and non-transactional piece of the business. So that's actually good news. Now obviously, as it becomes a deficit a based impact on the  budget, that would certainly be the wild card. But the fact is, is that where we play is expected to be relatively constant with the plan. And then the next thing you have to do is you have to go in and look at what pieces of the budget actually are growing and which ones are most susceptible. Clearly, platforms are more susceptible than the C4 I squared R [ph] which is really the intelligence piece of control, communications, surveillance and electronic capability, which as you know is the bulk of where we play. And so the market segment where we're playing, we think, are actually going to be slightly positive. When you take a bigger picture perspective and you take a look at the segments of the business, the segments of the whole government business that are going to grow the most or go down the most, you're going to see the FAA and the cyber and IT components are expected to be strong single-digits growth, 6% to 8% growth in this environment. So maybe, Steve, what I'm doing is I'm essentially repeating the point of the question. Our Defense business is growing very, very nicely in these adjacencies. And so at the end of the day, I think we've got a strong position. That's why we talked with you about the backlog. And in that regard, that's how we feel about Defense. We think it's a strong business. And even though we understand your concerns in terms on the street, in terms of cyclical, secular issues, we think we've got a strong Defense business in the future. We're going to continue to compete in our core markets.

Thank you for your questions, and let me just close the call here by saying that we understand that we have a lot of changes in our business. We have been very clear about the portfolio transformation, which includes not only the Defense adjacency which is going extraordinarily well, dealing with the stress in the defense budgets and also migrating the portfolio into more valuable, commercial and emerging market opportunities. That's both done on an organic basis with our investments and with the allocation of cash. 
We're proud of the fact that we think that strategy is working well for us. And even with all these changes and with these headwinds, we wanted to confirm and conclude this call by saying that each and every quarter, you can count on us to be delivering and executing as has always been expected of ITT. So I want to thank you for your interest and let you know that we feel pretty good about the quarter. We hope you do as well, and we look forward to talking with you in December.

Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our attractive portfolio produces consistent and reliable results time and time again. This strong performance reflects our intense focus, as always, on strategic execution. And in this quarter again we saw some top-notch operating results by teams all across ITT, and it wasn't easy. Our focused productivity and cost management programs more than offset external headwinds, including some significant volatility in commodity pricing and foreign exchange. 
We saw some very strong organic growth in our Fluid Technology and Motion & Flow Control businesses where our markets continue to strengthen across the majority of our product segments and geographic regions. We're extremely pleased with the prior investments that we've made in emerging markets where we continue to see great results, in fact, growing 22% in the quarter, and of course we're expected to maintain strong growth rates in emerging markets for the next several years. 
In our Defense & Information Solutions business, we saw a 25% improvement in orders. And in addition, we recently generated several key strategic wins that validate ITT leadership positions in a number of important programs. For example, in early October, we were awarded a $1.4 billion contract to provide comprehensive support services for all U.S. Army facilities in Kuwait. And this represents the fourth major facilities operations contract awarded ITT in 2010, and it solidifies our role as a premier provider of base operation services in the Middle East. 
In the third quarter, ITT was also recognized as a leading provider of space-based imaging payloads, winning two very important contracts to build next-generation imaging systems that are going to serve commercial and government markets. Our technologies will ultimately support imaging programs for both DigitalGlobe and GeoEye. And as a leading provider of electronic countermeasures, we've also won several pivotal 2010 awards for both ground and airborne jamming capabilities. These include the CREW 3.2 and CREW 3.3 program and development technology under the Next Generation Jammer program for the Naval Air Systems Command. 
Our ongoing strategy to further align our business portfolio with macro trend is progressing very, very nicely. We're expanding in air traffic management, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made in the Fluid Technology business, notably in the Analytics business and the Godwin Pump businesses, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Another point of specific pride in the quarter is the nice accretion that we're already seeing from these 2010 acquisitions.
And so all of this execution and this performance and program wins gives us great confidence in increasing our guidance for the full year. We're on track to deliver $4.30 per share in 2010, which represents a 15% increase in full year adjusted EPS. And that's another record performance for ITT. In fact, a performance that follows the best-in-class result in 2009, and it handily tops our prior record during the 2008 pre-economic crisis period where our EPS was $3.99. Our performance is even more notable when you consider these growth rates are being achieved while we're also investing in our future. 
As you know, we take a long-term approach to sustainable, predictable growth. And in 2010, we elected to reinvest the equivalent of six EPS points of growth into incremental investments for our future, the third straight year of incremental investments to an already strong base. These investments are all in attractive growth areas such as air traffic management, emerging market expansion, product innovation, our defense adjacency, diversity strategy and analytical instrumentation. Absent those critical investments which are already benefiting our bottom line, our 2010 earnings would actually be on track for some 21% growth.
So simply put, we believe our quarterly results and the full year outlook demonstrate that this portfolio continues to produce solid results. And now let's turn things over to Denise to review the financials."
280322,114543695,83502,"ITT Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.Third quarter revenues were flat as the",2679,"Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.
Third quarter revenues were flat as the growth of 17% at Motion and 11% at Fluid nicely offset the 9% decline at Defense. Organic revenue grew 3% at Fluid due to strength in both the U.S. and the European municipal markets, and Motion continued to deliver stellar organic results, growing 22% with double-digit improvement in all of those businesses. Defense's results included anticipated declines in CREW 2.1 and U.S. SINCGARS. 
So total organic orders in the quarter were extremely strong, and we are particularly pleased that the 18% improvement included growth at every one of our 10 value centers. Defense orders doubled compared to the second quarter and improved 25% compared to the prior year. Motion orders were strong at 20%, and Fluid orders were solid at 5%. 
Segment operating income exceeded expectations, declining 3% to $339 million. Exceptional operating productivity in the quarter contributed 100 basis points to the margin improvement. In total, margins declined 40 basis points due to negative foreign exchange, higher pension and a 60 basis point increase in incremental growth investments. 
During the quarter and throughout all of 2010, we've continued to make incremental investments in key growth platforms, including oil and gas, energy efficiency and emerging market expansion. And as just a reminder, we do include a chart in the appendix that provides a nice walk of our margin performance drivers versus the prior year.
Lastly, our third quarter adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 6% to $1.08 due to solid operating performances, lower corporate expenses and a favorable tax rate. In addition, our 2010 acquisitions were $0.02 accretive in the quarter, and that includes the impact of purchase accounting. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a record $4.30, which puts us on track to deliver a 15% improvement compared to 2009, which as you'll recall was a year of best in class adjusted EPS performance for ITT in a difficult macro environment. And as Steve indicated earlier, included in this forecasted 15% EPS growth are about six points of incremental investments that we made during 2010 to support our future growth.
Turning to our financial position on Slide 5. Our consistently strong financial position is built on a legacy of strong free cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, and these hallmarks of our performance are reflected once again in our third quarter results. The solid third quarter net debt to net capital ratio of 14.4% incorporates continued investment in organic growth platforms, such as the U.S. nationwide build out of the FAA’s ADS-B air traffic management system. 
The ratio also reflects the net funding of the 2010 portfolio alignment action with the acquisitions of Godwin, Nova and Canberra. And at quarter end, we still have more than $900 million in cash. Year-to-date free cash flow of $480 million was nicely ahead of our internal expectations due to stronger operating results, and we now expect to exceed our full year free cash flow conversion target of 100%. 
Now let's take a look at Fluid Technology's third quarter results. Turn to Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 11% to $920 million. Our successful 2010 acquisitions contributed $87 million of incremental revenue. And keep in mind, we just closed the Godwin transaction this August. Foreign exchange caused a revenue headwind of about 2%, so excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic revenue improved 3%. 
We are particularly pleased to see that Water & Wastewater grew 6% organically and 24% in total. The results exceeded our expectations due to stronger demand across global municipal markets. For example, U.S. and Asian municipal markets delivered double-digit growth, and we were very pleased to see that the pace of activity in parts of Europe added some nice growth to the quarter.
The revenue performances of the newly acquired Analytics and Godwin businesses were simply extraordinary, immediately validating the strategic fit with ITT and the strong demand drivers in those markets served. 
Residential and Commercial Water delivered a third straight quarter of organic growth growing 4% in Q3 and organic revenue and industrial process declined 5% due to lower industrial project deliveries that were partially offset by strength in Latin American mining. However, IP's organic orders continue to be very strong, growing 12% with improvement in each of the seven primary end markets served.
Fluid operating income grew 7%, operating productivity improved 200 basis points, and these improvements reflect the structural benefit of prior aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that have repeatedly offset cost inflation and mix without the benefit of significant volume expansion. In total, operating margins declined 50 basis points due to increased strategic investment and negative foreign exchange.
Total fluid organic orders grew 5% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio exceeded one due to double-digit growth at Industrial Process and Residential and Commercial Water. 
For the fourth quarter, we're now forecasting Fluid organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. This growth will be driven by a recovery in the late cycle Industrial Process business and continued stability in the municipal markets. Our full year 2010 organic growth forecast has now improved from flat to 1%, and the strong acquisition results have further driven our total fluid revenue growth forecast from 6% to 8%.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, and let’s review another exceptionally strong quarter for Motion & Flow. Motion's organic revenue growth of 22% exceeded 20% for a third straight quarter. And keep in mind that this 2010 strength follows a decline of only 14% in 2009, which as you know was pretty good, comparatively speaking. The Q3 segment strength continued to be broad-based, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. And emerging market results were particularly strong. They increased 50%. The strong revenue growth was lead by Interconnect Solutions with a 37% improvement due to strong demand across most end markets. Motion Tech exceeded expectations for the quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 19% on stronger OEM deliveries from recent platform wins. 
Now exiting Q2, we expected to see a meaningful Q3 slowing from the expiration of the European auto stimulus. But clearly, it didn't happen in the quarter and we're now expecting to see that flowing in the fourth quarter. Motion & Flow Control's operating income improved 13%. Operating productivity improved 50 basis points. However, margins declined 50 basis points in total due to higher investment, FX and pension.
Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 20%, with all businesses contributing double-digit growth. As a result of our strong year-to-date performances and the positive demand indicators, we are maintaining Motion & Flow Control's 18% organic revenue forecast for 2010. This implies a 3% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. Now the deceleration is mainly caused by an anticipated slowing in the European automotive market after the expiration of the stimulus benefit. Excluding this impact on Motion Tech, the balance of the motion businesses are expected to grow in the mid-teens organically in Q4.
Now let's turn to Defense, which is on Slide 8. While not always evident in the quarterly results, our Defense team has continued to aggressively position itself for the future through key strategic wins, customer diversification and transformational performances. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 9%. This decline primarily reflected lower activity on software engineering service contracts, anticipated declines in U.S. SINCGARS and CREW 2.1 and some night-vision and jammer delivery delays on firm orders that just moved into Q4. 
In the quarter, we did see nice revenue growth from air traffic management activities, special-purpose jammers, radar equipment and composite structures. Strong third quarter operating margins of 13% reflected operating productivity of 50 basis points, derived from the Defense transformation and strong contract execution. In total, margins declined 30 basis points, largely due to higher pension expenses. 
Turning to orders, we were very pleased with the strong organic growth delivered by each Defense business. Q3 orders were 100% better than Q2 and 25% better than the prior year. Geospatial orders improved 53% due to strong demand for our commercial imaging satellite payloads. Electronic Systems orders improved 34%. This included a SINCGARS orders for Iraq under the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program. Now you may recall in the second quarter we reduced our forecast because of the challenges associated with executing a direct sale to Iraq. So we're very pleased with the progress our team made to transform a portion of this opportunity into a U.S. FMF order. 
Lastly, Information Systems grew 8% due to increased activity on the FAA ADS-B program and the U.S. Army Prepositioned Stock program in Kuwait. For the full year, we maintained our forecast of $6 billion in Defense revenue. This forecast includes strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4, and the main drivers of the incremental performance are some recently awarded international SINCGARS FMF contracts including Iraq, Taiwan and Bahrain, increased activity under the new Afghanistan Army Corps contract, incremental jammer shipments and recovered Q3 production delays.
Turn to Slide 9. We've added a summary of some different backlog metrics to help provide additional perspective on the future opportunities that our Defense team is winning today. And in recent years, we have seen some changing dynamics that are driving variation in our order intake patterns and backlog statistics. Today, we have a much more diversified customer mix than we've ever had. Nearly 25% of our customer base is outside of the U.S. Armed Services budget, and these new customers including international customers follow unique new order patterns. In addition, we no longer expect to see large block orders for surge products like CREW and SINCGARS that have been ramping down for a couple of years now. So these factors add to the volatility of our quarterly metrics. 
In addition, we're seeing an increase in protest activities from incumbents, especially for those large multiyear contracts. These protests may delay the recognition of orders in revenue and complicate our ability to forecast outcomes. And lastly, we believe that customers may reduce funding levels and frequencies in response to current budgetary pressures. Keep in mind that our current calculation for funded backlog include orders that have been authorized and appropriated for funding by the customer. 
In Q3, our funded backlog increased to $4.3 billion, representing a $175 million increase from Q2 levels. The ultimate 2010 backlog will largely be determined by the timing and the duration of funding for large service contracts that we've already won.
As a result of the changing customer mix I described, we are also seeing increased service revenues. This increase reduces our sales to backlog ratios because service contracts, even multiyear ones, typically fund in periods ranging from three- to nine-months increments. Also keep in mind that services represent about 40% of our revenues, and that's relatively high compared to many of our defense peers.
So as a result of the factors discussed above, we're providing an estimate of our funded and our unfunded awards. This combined calculation totals over $10 billion. The funded and unfunded calculation is not intended to be a replacement for the funded backlog metrics. But we will periodically provide this information to show the aggregate size of the opportunity pipeline in our Defense segment. We've also listed five recent key wins that further demonstrate the strategic strength and diversity of our Defense segment. These all reflect the magnitude of the impact that the changing dynamics in our business are having on our backlog statistics.
In total, the awards listed here represent $4.8 billion of potential future value, and they are all excluded from both our funded and unfunded calculations. The first two multiyear service awards totaling $2.7 billion are excluded because they are currently being protested by incumbents. We also excluded potential orders under three recent major IDIQ awards, totaling $2 billion. We won a $1.4 billion SE2020 air traffic management IDIQ award from the FAA. And we won two important IDIQ awards for critical next-generation technologies from the U.S. Armed Services. $455 million for CREW 3.2 Jammer capabilities and $260 million for enhanced night vision goggles. 
So in summary, while the ultimate outcome of some of these awards remains uncertain, we are certain that our Defense business is very well positioned to continue to generate solid returns on investment and cash flows in the future. Despite the difficult budgetary environment, this Defense team is clearly continuing to win the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we had two major special events, the annual asbestos update, and the gain on the sale of CAS, the Defense seat of business. So here's an overview of those two items and how they impact our reported results. The asbestos liability update announced today is part of our normal annual accounting process, designed to ensure that our asbestos liability reflects the most current information available to us. Future annual liability updates could involve increases or decreases, and we can't predict the direction or magnitude of future changes. We believe that our process and rolling ten-year model that we use to estimate our probable future asbestos expenses and related third-party recovery is consistent with best practices in the industry.
In the third quarter, we are increasing our asbestos liability with a related after-tax charge to continuing operations of $204 million or $1.10 per share. Now this charge has been categorized as a special item in the quarter, and it’s not reflected in our adjusted EPS results or projections. The increase in the liability reflects more recent data that points to higher expected net cost over the next 10 years, including increased settlement values in the last year. We've also seen significantly increased activity in several higher cost jurisdictions, increasing the number of cases to be actively litigated and increasing expected legal costs.
In contrast to an approach that's used by other companies, we do include estimated future defense costs in our estimate of future liabilities. It is important to note that the average projected net annual pretax cash flow impact of future asbestos payment is $25 million per year for the next five years and $50 million to $60 million over the remaining years of the projection period. We do not, at this time, expect a material impact on our free cash flow over the next 10 years. The other special event in the third quarter was the recognition of after-tax benefits of $152 million or $0.82 per share, associated with the divestiture of CAS.
So now let's turn to our adjusted EPS guidance, and that's on Slide 11. Based on our strong year-to-date performances, the strength of our acquisitions and solid end-market demand, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance midpoint to $4.30, 15% higher than 2009. We've tightened the range to $4.28 to $4.32 to better reflect our expectations for the full year. The $0.17 guidance midpoint increase includes the $0.12 of incremental Q3 performance and incremental Q4 performances of $0.05. Now a big driver of the increase is the positive contribution from the successful 2010 acquisitions that were initially expected to be $0.04 dilutive, but they're now expected to be $0.03 accretive. Strong operating performances and favorable corporate results account for the balance of the increase.
2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 4% in total and 2% organically to $11.1 billion. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.6% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisitions. The full year operating margin performance is 70 basis points better than the prior year. 
So in summary, 2010 has been a year of tremendous progress for ITT. We're improving our portfolio alignment. We're investing in future growth platforms and we're delivering premier earnings growth once again. So now I'm going to turn it over to Tom, and we will start the Q&A."

And we will also, to the extent we don't conflict with the distribution channel, we will also be flowing the analytical instrumentation through those channels. So it's the best of both worlds. I should say also that's very similar to our Godwin strategy and it's very similar to the cross-selling strategy we referred to even within our own ITT distribution. And so we're taking advantage of the geographical benefit of this huge selling and distribution network, really which is second to none in the world.

I just wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question and maybe this isn't really the platform for this question, but I'm not sure when we're going to talk again. It's been a relatively frustrating year from a stock performance perspective, and obviously, the elephant in the room is the Defense business. I think a lot of people out there continue to believe that this business is just facing massive secular headwinds over the next couple of years, and you see it in all the Defense multiples. And sure enough all the defense companies this quarter like General Dynamics missing its revenue guidance, but the margins are better than expected, not really getting credit for that. You guys talk about the acquisitions you're executing on the big pipeline. It seems to me like you're kind of setting us up for running acquisitions. But at what stage do you get frustrated with the degree of misunderstanding at a portfolio and do something a little more aggressive on the portfolio management side, maybe lever the company up, buyback a ton of stock? You've done a very good job with the card you've been dealt over the last six or seven years, Steve. And I'm just wondering at what point do you get frustrated with The Street view that just seems like no matter how much you explain the diversity and the growth potential of this Defense business, it just doesn't seem to me that you're going to be able to get out of this rut over the next year or so. So I'm just curious as to what level of frustration you guys have over there in the board room?"

What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the Defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve,",600,"I think one can never get frustrated in this business. What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the Defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve, to the point of your question, there is more concern about our Defense business in The Street than we believe is appropriate. There is no question that some pieces of our Defense business are under stress. I think we're being extremely transparent about that. But at the end of the day, we're going to continue to communicate the reasons why we think the Defense component is a strong and robust component. Let me just review some top-level statistics with you. If you take a look at the $700-ish billion top-level market that we think about in Defense, Secretary Gates has already articulated that he's going to drive around $100 billion of productivity through efficiency in the acquisition process and other cost eliminations. When you take that efficiency through the budgets and recognize that just slightly over half of the budget is the piece of the budget that we really, really like and that we really want to preserve and Secretary Gates really wants to preserve, which is the operation and maintenance and the RDT and yearly investment equipment side of the budget. The current DoD plan is to hold that essentially flat, in fact it's flat to up 1%. That's the place that we play. So the first thing you have to understand is that in the market segments where we play, the Secretary in Defense and everyone else is trying to drive this efficiency that you all hear about to actually preserve the budget component that's the sort of non-logistics, non-personnel and non-transactional piece of the business. So that's actually good news. Now obviously, if there becomes a deficit, a based impact on the budget, that would certainly be the wild card. But the fact is, is that where we play is expected to be relatively constant with the plan. Then the next thing you have to do is you have to go in and look at what pieces of the budget actually are growing and which ones are most susceptible. Clearly, platforms are more susceptible than the C4ISR which is really the intelligence piece of control, communications, surveillance and electronic capability, which as you know is the bulk of where we play. And so the market segment where we're playing, we think, are actually going to be slightly positive. When you take a bigger picture perspective and you take a look at the segments of the business, the segments of the whole government business that are going to grow the most or go down the most, you're going to see the FAA and the cyber and the IT components are expected to be strong single-digits growth, 6% to 8% growth in this environment. So maybe, Steve, what I'm doing is I'm essentially repeating the point of the question. Our Defense business is growing very, very nicely in these adjacencies. And so at the end of the day, I think we've got a strong position. That's why we talked with you about the backlog. And in that regard, that's how we feel about Defense. We think it's a strong business. And even though we understand your concerns in terms of on The Street, in terms of cyclical, secular issues, we think we've got a strong Defense business in the future. We're going to continue to compete in our core markets."

I think the operating income number to your question is going to be proportional to the amount of actual revenue opportunity, revenue growth that we have. So we'll continue to be working the operating income. That will obviously be under pressure as sales tend to be in the flattish range as we go through this transformational mix in the Defense budget.

Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our attractive portfolio produces consistent and reliable results time and time again. This strong performance reflects our intense focus,",653," Thanks, Tom, and I thank all of you for joining us this morning. Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our attractive portfolio produces consistent and reliable results time and time again. This strong performance reflects our intense focus, as always, on strategic execution. And in this quarter again we saw some top-notch operating results by teams all across ITT, and it wasn't easy. Our focused productivity and cost management programs more than offset external headwinds, including some significant volatility in commodity pricing and foreign exchange.
 We saw some very strong organic growth in our Fluid Technology and Motion & Flow Control businesses where our markets continue to strengthen across the majority of our product segments and geographic regions. We're extremely pleased with the prior investments that we've made in emerging markets where we continue to see great results, in fact, growing 22% in the quarter, and of course we're expected to maintain strong growth rates in emerging markets for the next several years.
 In our Defense & Information Solutions business, we saw a 25% improvement in orders. And in addition, we recently generated several key strategic wins that validate ITT leadership position in a number of important programs. For example, in early October, we were awarded a $1.4 billion contract to provide comprehensive support services for all U.S. Army facilities in Kuwait. And this represents the fourth major facilities operations contract awarded ITT in 2010, and it solidifies our role as a premier provider of base operation services in the Middle East.
 In the third quarter, ITT was also recognized as a leading provider of space-based imaging payloads, winning two very important contracts to build next-generation imaging systems that are going to serve commercial and government markets. Our technologies will ultimately support imaging programs for both DigitalGlobe and GeoEye. And as a leading provider of electronic countermeasures, we've also won several pivotal 2010 awards for both ground and airborne jamming capabilities. This includes CREW 3.2 and  CREW 3.3 programs and the development technology under the Next Generation Jammer program for the Naval Air Systems Command.
 Our ongoing strategy to further align our business portfolio with macro trend is progressing very, very nicely. We're expanding in air traffic management, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made in the Fluid Technology business, notably in the Analytics business and the Godwin Pump businesses, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Another point of specific pride in the quarter is the nice accretion that we're already seeing from these 2010 acquisitions.
 And so all of these execution and this performance and program wins gives us great confidence in increasing our guidance for the full year. We're on track to deliver $4.30 per share in 2010, which represents a 15% increase in full year adjusted EPS. And that's another record performance for ITT. In fact, a performance that follows the best in class results in 2009, and it handily tops our prior record during the 2008 pre-economic crisis period where our EPS was $3.99. Our performance is even more notable when you consider these growth rates are being achieved while we're also investing in our future.
 As you know, we take a long-term approach to sustainable, predictable growth. And in 2010, we are elected to reinvest the equivalent of six EPS points of growth into incremental investments for our future, the third straight year of incremental investments to an already strong base. These investments are in all attractive growth areas such as air traffic management, emerging market expansion, product innovation, our defense adjacency, diversity strategy and analytical instrumentation. Absent those critical investments which are already benefiting our bottom line, our 2010 earnings would actually be on track for some 21% growth.
 So simply put, we believe our quarterly results and the full year outlook demonstrate that this portfolio continues to produce solid results. And now let's turn things over to Denise to review the financials.

280322,114543695,86611,"ITT Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","ITT Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses. Third quarter revenues were flat as t",2679," Thanks, Steve. Let's turn now to Slide 4. We exceeded our third quarter EPS guidance by $0.12 due to stronger operating productivity, exceptional acquisition, integration and execution and lower corporate expenses.
 Third quarter revenues were flat as the growth of 17% at Motion and 11% at Fluid nicely offset the 9% decline at Defense. Organic revenue grew 3% at Fluid due to strength in both the U.S. and the European municipal markets, and Motion continue to deliver stellar organic results, growing 22% with double-digit improvement in all of those businesses.  Defense's results included anticipated declines in CREW 2.1 and U.S. SINCGARS.
 So total organic orders in the quarter were extremely strong, and we are particularly pleased that the 18% improvement included growth at every one of our 10 value centers. Defense orders doubled compared to the second quarter and improved 25% compared to the prior year. Motion orders were strong at 20%, and Fluid orders were solid at 5%.
 Segment operating income exceeded expectations, declining 3% to $339 million. Exceptional operating productivity in the quarter contributed 100 basis points to the margin improvement. In total, margins declined 40 basis points due to negative foreign exchange, higher pension and a 60 basis point increase in incremental growth investments.
 During the quarter and throughout all of 2010, we've continued to make incremental investments in key growth platforms, including oil and gas, energy efficiency and emerging market expansion. And as just a reminder, we do include a chart in the appendix that provides a nice walk of our margin performance drivers versus the prior year.
 Lastly, our third quarter adjusted continuing earnings per share grew 6% to $1.8 due to solid operating performances, lower corporate expenses and a favorable tax rate. In addition, our 2010 acquisitions were $0.02 accretive in the quarter, and that includes the impact of purchase accounting. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a record $4.30, which puts us on track to deliver a 15% improvement compared to 2009, which as you'll recall was a year of best in class adjusted EPS performance for ITT in a difficult macro environment. And as Steve indicated earlier, included in this forecasted 15% EPS growth are about six points of incremental investments that we made during 2010 to support our future growth.
 Turning to our financial position on Slide 5. Our consistently strong financial position is built on a legacy of strong free cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, and these hallmarks of our performance are reflected once again in our third quarter results. The solid third quarter net debt to net capital ratio of 14.4% incorporates continued investment in organic growth platforms, such as the U.S. nationwide build out of FAA ADS-B air traffic management system.
 The ratio also reflects the net funding of the 2010 portfolio alignment action with the acquisitions of Godwin, Nova and Canberra. And at quarter end, we still have more than $900 million in cash. Year-to-date free cash flow of $480 million was nicely ahead of our internal expectations due to stronger operating results, and we now expect to exceed our full year free cash flow conversion target of 100%.
 Now let's take a look at Fluid Technology's third quarter results, turn to Slide 6. Total Fluid revenues improved 11% to $920 million. Our successful 2010 acquisitions contributed $87 million of incremental revenue. And keep in mind, we just closed the Godwin transaction this August. Foreign exchange cost of revenue headwind of about 2%, so excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic revenue improved 3%.
 We are particularly pleased to see that Water & Wastewater grew 6% organically and 24% in total. The results exceeded our expectations due to stronger demand across global municipal markets. For example, U.S. and Asian municipal markets delivered double-digit growth, and we were very pleased to see that the pace of activity in parts of Europe added some nice growth to the quarter.
 The revenue performances of the newly acquired Analytics and Godwin businesses were simply extraordinary, immediately validating the strategic fit with ITT and the strong demand drivers in those markets served.
 Residential and Commercial Water delivered a third straight quarter of organic growth growing 4% in Q3 and organic revenue and industrial process declined 5% due to lower industrial project deliveries that were partially offset by strength in Latin American mining. However, IP's organic orders continue to be very strong, growing 12% with improvement in each of the seven primary end markets served.
 Fluid operating income grew 7%, operating productivity improved 200 basis points, and these improvements reflect the structural benefit of prior aggressive restructuring actions and expanded global strategic sourcing activities that have repeatedly offset cost inflation and mix without the benefit of significant volume expansion.  In total, operating margins declined 50 basis points due to increased strategic investment and negative foreign exchange.
 Total fluid organic orders grew 5% in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio exceeded one due to double-digit growth at industrial process and Residential and Commercial Water.
 For the fourth quarter, we're now forecasting Fluid organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. This growth will be driven by a recovery in the late cycle Industrial Process business and continued stability in the municipal markets. Our full year 2010 organic growth forecast has now improved from flat to 1%, and the strong acquisition results have further driven our total fluid revenue growth forecast from 6% to 8%.
 Now let's turn to Slide 7, and lets review another exceptionally strong quarter for Motion & Flow. Motion's organic revenue growth of 22% exceeded 20% for a third straight quarter. And keep in mind that this 2010 strength follows a decline of only 14% in 2009, which as you know was pretty good, comparatively speaking. The Q3 segment strength continue to be broad-based, with each business generating double digit growth in the quarter. And emerging market results were particularly strong. They increased 50%. The strong revenue growth was lead by Interconnect Solutions with a 37% improvement due to strong demand across most end markets. Motion Tech exceeded expectations for the quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 19% on stronger OEM deliveries from recent platform wins.
 Now exiting Q2, we expected to see a meaningful Q3 slowing from the expiration of the European auto stimulus. But clearly, it didn't happen in the quarter and we're now expecting to see that flowing in the fourth quarter. Motion & Flow Control's operating income improved 13%. Operating productivity improved 50 basis points. However, margins declined 50 basis points in total due to higher investment, FX and pension.
 Motion & Flow Control's organic orders improved 20%, with all businesses contributing double-digit growth. As a result of our strong year-to-date performances and the positive demand indicators, we are maintaining Motion & Flow Control's 18% organic revenue forecast for 2010. This implies a 3% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. Now the deceleration is mainly caused by an anticipated slowing in the European automotive market after the expiration of the stimulus benefit. Excluding this impact on Motion Tech, the balance of the motion businesses are expected to grow in the mid-teens organically in Q4.
 Now let's turn to Defense, which is on Slide 8. While not always evident in the quarterly results, our Defense team has continued to aggressively position itself for the future through key strategic wins, customer diversification and transformational performances. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 9%. This decline primarily reflected lower activity on software engineering service contracts, anticipated declines in U.S. SINCGARS in CREW 2.1 and some night-vision and jammer delivery delays on firm orders that just moved into Q4.
 In the quarter, we did see nice revenue growth from air traffic management activities, special purpose jammers, radar equipment and composite structures.  Strong third quarter operating margins of 13% reflected operating productivity of 50 basis points, derived from the Defense transformation and strong contract execution. In total, margins declined 30 basis points, largely due to higher pension expenses.
 Turning to orders, we were very pleased with the strong organic growth delivered by each Defense business. Q3 orders were 100% better than Q2 and 25% better than the prior year. Geospatial orders improved 53% due to strong demand for our commercial imaging satellite payloads. Electronic Systems orders improved 34%. This included a SINCGARS orders for Iraq under the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program. Now you may recall in the second quarter we reduced our forecast because of the challenges associated with executing a direct sale to Iraq. So we're very pleased with the progress our team made to transform a portion of these opportunity into a U.S. FMF order.
 Lastly, information systems grew 8% due to increased activity on the FAA ADS-B program and the U.S. Army Prepositioned Stock program in Kuwait. For the full year, we maintained our forecast of $6 billion in Defense revenue. This forecast includes strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4, and the main drivers of the incremental performance are some recently awarded international SINCGARS FMF contracts including Iraq, Taiwan and Bahrain, increased activity under the new Afghanistan Army Corps contract, incremental jammer shipments and recovered Q3 production delays.
 Turn to Slide 9. We've added a summary of some different backlog metrics to help provide additional perspective on the future opportunities that our Defense team is winning today. And in recent years, we have seen some changing dynamics that are driving variation in our order intake patterns and backlog statistics. Today, we have a much more diversified customer mix than we've ever had. Nearly 25% of our customer base is outside of the U.S. Armed Services budget, and these new customers including international customers follow unique new order patterns. In addition, we no longer expect to see large block orders for surged products like CREW and SINCGARS that have been ramping down for a couple of years now. So these factors add to the volatility of our quarterly metrics.
 In addition, we're seeing an increase in protest activities from incumbent, especially for those large multiyear contracts. These protests may delay the recognition of orders in revenue and complicate our ability to forecast outcomes. And lastly, we believe that customers may reduce funding levels and frequencies in response to current budgetary pressures. Keep in mind that our current calculation for funded backlog include orders that have been authorized and appropriated for funding by the customer.
 In Q3, our funded backlog increased to $4.3 billion, represented a $175 million increase from Q2 levels. The ultimate 2010 backlog will largely be determined by the timing and the duration of funding for large service contracts that we've already won.
 As a result of the changing customer mix I described, we are also seeing increased service revenues. This increase reduces our sales to backlog ratios because service contracts and even multiyear one, typically fund in periods ranging from three to nine months increment. Also keep in mind that services represent about 40% of our revenues, and that's relatively high compared to many of our defense peers.
 So as a result of the factors discussed above, we're providing an estimate of our funded and unfunded awards. This combined calculation totals over $10 billion. The funded and unfunded calculation is not intended to be a replacement for the funded backlog metrics. But we will periodically provide this information to show the aggregate size of the opportunity pipeline in our Defense segment. We've also listed five recent key wins that further demonstrate the strategic strength and diversity of our Defense segment. These all reflect the magnitude of the impact that the changing dynamics in our business are having on our backlog statistics.
 In total, the awards listed here represent $4.8 billion of potential future value, and they are all excluded from both our funded and unfunded calculations. The first two multiyear service award totaling $2.7 billion are excluded because they are currently being protested by incumbents. We also excluded potential orders under three recent major IDIQ awards, totaling $2 billion. We won a $1.4 billion SE2020 air traffic management IDIQ award from the FAA. And we won two important IDIQ award for critical next-generation technologies from the U.S. Armed Services. $455 million for CREW 3.2 Jammer capabilities and $260 million for enhanced night vision goggles.
 So in summary, while the ultimate outcome of some of these awards remains uncertain, we are certain that our Defense business is very well positioned to continue to generate solid return on investment and cash flows in the future. Despite the difficult budgetary environment, this Defense team is clearly continuing to win the future.
 Let's turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we had two major special events, the annual asbestos update, and the gain on the sale of CAS, the Defense sit of business. So here's an overview of those two items and how they impact our reported results. The asbestos liability update announced today is part of our normal annual accounting process, designed to ensure that our asbestos liability reflects the most current information available to us. Future annual liability updates could involve increases or decreases, and we can't predict the direction or magnitude of future changes. We believe that our process in rolling ten-year model that we used to estimate our probable future asbestos expenses and related third-party recoveries is consistent with best  practices in the industry.
 In the third quarter, we are increasing our asbestos liability with a related after-tax charge to continuing operations of $204 million or $1.10 per share. Now this charge has been categorized as a special item in the quarter, and is not reflected in our adjusted EPS results or projections. The increase in the liability reflects more recent data that points to higher expected net cost over the next 10 years, including increased settlement values in the last year. We've also seen significantly increased activity in several higher cost jurisdictions, increasing the number of cases to be actively litigated and increasing expected legal costs.
 In contrast to an approach that's used by other companies, we do include estimated future defense costs in our estimate of future liabilities. It is important to note that the average projected net annual pretax cash flow impact of future asbestos payment is $25 million per year for the next five years and $50 million to $60 million over the remaining years of the projection period. We do not, at this time, expect a material impact on our free cash flow over the next 10 years. The other special event in the third quarter was the recognition of after-tax benefits of $152 million or $0.82 per share, associated with the divestiture of CAS.
 So now let's turn to our adjusted EPS guidance, and that's on Slide 11. Based on our strong year-to-date performances, the strength of our acquisitions and solid end-market demand, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance midpoint to $4.30, 15% higher than 2009. We've tightened the range to $4.28 to $4.32 to better reflect our expectations for the full year. The $0.17 guidance midpoint increase includes the $0.12 of incremental Q3 performance and incremental Q4 performances of $0.05. Now big driver of the increase is the positive contribution from the successful 2010 acquisition that we're initially expected to be $0.04 dilutive, but they're now expected to be $0.03 accretive. Strong operating performances and favorable corporate results account for the balance of the increase.
 2010 continuing ITT revenue is now expected to grow 4% in total and 2% organically to $11.1 billion. Segment operating margin guidance was increased to 12.6% due to expanded productivity initiatives that are expected to more than offset material cost pressures and some margin dilution from acquisition. The full year operating margin performance is 70 basis points better than the prior year.
 So in summary, 2010 has been a year of tremendous progress for ITT. We're improving our portfolio alignment. We're investing in future growth platforms and we're delivering premier earnings growth once again. So now I'm going to turn it over to Tom, and we will start the Q&A.

And to have them accretive so early after we've acquired them, I think, is pretty strong performance. I think the first thing to understand is that these businesses that we bought are very strategically aligned with our current businesses. So that gives us a lot of capabilities when we first acquired these businesses to be able to get incremental value out of them. These were very high quality assets that we bought. They were very good companies. And what we've seen is we have seen some strong end-market demand, particularly with Godwin on the Dewatering side. So that actually performed much better for us than we thought. And again, these are very strong businesses and so we're very happy with how they're performing.

We're getting some early leverage of the organization, particularly in Fluid Technology, where we're able to leverage the scale of our distribution and selling networks. And I think the teams have been very cautious on the cost of integration. We make certain assumptions in our model when we make the acquisition to tie into appropriate valuation. But I think the teams have really done a very good job of not adding any additional cost for acquisition integration that was necessary. So all in, I think we've had a lot of practice in the last several years and we're getting better at it.

I can go back and point to acquisitions we did with Allen Osbourne, with Insight, with Dolphin, those were all small-scale acquisitions. But as an example, a couple of those we're central to our ability to deliver the miniature soldier radio wave form and other secure GPS technology as adjuncts to our jamming and communications.

However, when we look at what we have seen in prior years versus what we saw this year, we did see a few changing dynamics. On a local base, we did see greater than expected activity in several of the high-cost fee jurisdictions. We also saw, in some areas, a substantial increase in the settlement values of various cases. And we also saw some aggressive behavior last year with some of the national plaintiff firms. And these are examples of things that we saw that we think in this charge that we took our very best estimate to make sure that we were covering the future impacts of these kinds of changes. And I'll point out as we have disclosed in the last year or so in all of our Ks and Qs, these charges can go up and down.

And that has been offset by this very aggressive adjacency strategy that has, coupled with the defense transformation, actually lays the operating margin. And considering the fact that, that CREW and SINCGARS headwind had actually higher than defense average margin, I think really supports the fact that this team is working it really, really hard. With the transformation that Dave Melcher and the team lead is going to give some nice incremental run rate benefits. They're continuing to do some productivity, and we actually expect to increase some of our restructuring activity in Defense to be able to position for the future. And that's overcoming an additional pension headwind. So all that in, we're going to have about the same margins next day. The Defense team is going to hold the margins about where they are.

Also in emerging markets, we've also been populating the teams with new application engineers and selling and marketing folks. As an example, three years ago, we had two people in India. Today, we have well over 200 in India, and that's tapering off. That's tapering off right now. We're investing a lot in value-based commercial excellence, which is to upgrade the overall process capability of our selling and front-end on the commercial side of the business. That will taper off a bit. So those are some examples of things that are tapering off.

In fact, several thousand salespeople around the world who are accessing municipal and commercial customers. And we will also, to the extent we don't conflict with the distribution channel, we will also be flowing the analytical instrumentation through those channels. So it's the best of both worlds. I should say also that's very similar to our Godwin strategy and it's very similar to the cross-selling strategy we referred to even within our own ITT distribution. And so we're taking advantage of the geographical benefit of this huge selling and distribution network, really, which is second to none in the world. And we're able to offer through this geographic benefit, the transport treatment and CAS technology that gives us the only capability of a comprehensive suite of technology to be able to address these needs.

I just wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question and maybe this isn't a platform for this question but I'm not sure when we're going to talk again.It's been a relatively frustrating year from a stock performance perspective, and obviously, the elephant in the room is the Defense business. I think a lot of people out there continue to believe that this business is just facing massive secular headwinds over the next couple of years, and you see it in all the Defense multiples. And sure enough all the defense companies this quarter like General Dynamics missing its revenue guidance, but the margins are better than expected, not really getting credit for that. You guys talked about the acquisitions you're executing on the big pipeline. It seems to me like you're kind of setting us up for running acquisitions. But at what stage do you get frustrated with the degree of misunderstanding at a portfolio and do something a little more aggressive on the portfolio management side, maybe lever the company up buyback a ton of stock? You've done a very good job with the card you've been dealt over the last six or seven years, Steve. And I'm just wondering at what point do you get frustrated with the street view that just seems like no matter how much you explain the diversity and the growth potential of this Defense business, it just doesn't seem to me that you're going to be able to get out of this rut over the next year or so. So I'm just curious as to what level of frustration you guys have over there in the board room?

What you need to do or what we do is we do our very level best to continue to communicate what we think is the right perspective on the defense business. And I will say that very specifically, Steve, to the point of your question, there is more concern about our Defense business in the street than we believe is appropriate. There is no question that some pieces of our Defense business are under stress. I think we're being extremely transparent about that. But at the end of the day, we're going to continue to communicate the reasons why we think the Defense component is a strong and robust component. Let me just review some top-level statistics with you. If you take a look at the $700-ish billion dollar top-level market that we think about in Defense, Secretary Gates has already articulated that he's going to drive around $100 billion of productivity through efficiency in the acquisition process and other cost elimination. When you take that efficiency through the budgets and recognize that just slightly over half of the budget is the piece of the budget that we really, really like and that we really want to preserve and Secretary Gates really wants to preserve, which is the operation and maintenance in the RDT and the yearly investment equipment side of the budget. The current DoD plan is to hold that essentially flat, in fact it's flat to up 1%. That's the place that we play. So the first thing you have to understand is that in the market segments where we play, the Secretary in Defense and everyone else is trying to drive this efficiency that you are all hear about to actually preserve the budget component that's the sort of non-logistics, non-personnel and non-transactional piece of the business. So that's actually good news. Now obviously, as it becomes a deficit a based impact on the  budget, that would certainly be the wild card. But the fact is, is that where we play is expected to be relatively constant with the plan. And then the next thing you have to do is you have to go in and look at what pieces of the budget actually are growing and which ones are most susceptible. Clearly, platforms are more susceptible than the C4 I squared R [ph] which is really the intelligence piece of control, communications, surveillance and electronic capability, which as you know is the bulk of where we play. And so the market segment where we're playing, we think, are actually going to be slightly positive. When you take a bigger picture perspective and you take a look at the segments of the business, the segments of the whole government business that are going to grow the most or go down the most, you're going to see the FAA and the cyber and IT components are expected to be strong single-digits growth, 6% to 8% growth in this environment. So maybe, Steve, what I'm doing is I'm essentially repeating the point of the question. Our Defense business is growing very, very nicely in these adjacencies. And so at the end of the day, I think we've got a strong position. That's why we talked with you about the backlog. And in that regard, that's how we feel about Defense. We think it's a strong business. And even though we understand your concerns in terms on the street, in terms of cyclical, secular issues, we think we've got a strong Defense business in the future. We're going to continue to compete in our core markets.

But beyond sort of the top line DoD budget concerns, it seems like DoD the rhetoric is more ominous each quarter about how they're going to squeeze profitability of service contracts, and you've won a lot of service contracts of late. Can you characterize sort of how the margins on these wins compare with your portfolio of legacy service business? And just beyond that also if I might ask, the direction of operating income at Defense in '11 and beyond, irrespective of margin?

But unlike sometimes what you hear in the rhetoric, productivity is not the antonym of operating margin. In fact, we prove year-after-year that we can get both in this business. And I think that, that applies in the Defense contracting model as well. So we should be able to hold up the operating margin. I think the operating income number to your question is going to be proportional to the amount of actual revenue opportunity, revenue growth that we have. So we'll continue to be working the operating income. That will obviously be under pressure as sales tend to be in the flattish range as we go through this transformational mix into the Defense budget. But at the end of the day, I am convinced as we drive for more fixed costs, we continue to drive for productivity at these efficiency initiatives. We should be able to maintain our operating margin.

 Thank you for your questions, and let me just close the call here by saying that we understand that we have a lot of changes in our business. We have been very clear about the portfolio transformation, which includes not only the Defense adjacency which is going extraordinarily well, dealing with the stress in the defense budgets and also migrating the portfolio into more valuable, commercial and emerging market opportunities. That's both done on an organic basis with our investments and with the allocation of cash.
 We're proud of the fact that we think that strategy is working well for us. And even with all these changes and with these headwinds, we wanted to confirm and conclude this call by saying that each and every quarter, you can count on us to be delivering and executing as has always been expected of ITT. So I want to thank you for your interest and let you know that we feel pretty good about the quarter. We hope you do as well, and we look forward to talking with you in December. So thank you very much.
