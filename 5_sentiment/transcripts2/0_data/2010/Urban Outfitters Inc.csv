Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and our Senior Team, including the majority of our brand and shared",2350,"Good morning, it's my pleasure to welcome you to the URBN Quarterly Conference Call. Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and our Senior Team, including the majority of our brand and shared service leads.Earlier today, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and 12-month period ending January 31, 2010. I will begin today's call by reading prepared commentary regarding our performance, then the group and I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As usual, you will be able to access the text of today's conference call on our corporate website at www.urbanoutfittersinc.com.We are delighted to report a series of record-breaking results for the quarter and for the year. The following summarizes our fourth quarter fiscal 2010 performance versus the comparable quarter last year.Net sales increased 16% to $589 million, the largest quarterly revenue performance in our history. Income from operations grew 88% to a record $119 million, resulting in a best-ever fourth quarter operating margin of 20%. Net income increased 92% to a record $78 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Comparable Retail segment sales, which includes our Direct-To-Consumer channel, rose by 9%. Comparable store sales increased 4%. Comp sales at Urban Outfitters were flat, and comp sales at Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain rose by 10%, 11% and 23%, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales soared 28% despite a strategic 18% reduction in circulation with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale segment revenues declined 2% to $23 million. Gross profit margins increased 771 basis points, driven by significant gains in initial margins and reductions in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product.Comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarter's end. Selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales declined one basis point for the period despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $224 million to $745 million. I'll begin this morning by providing more detail on each of their key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales.New and non-comparable store sales contributed $40 million, including a gain of $3 million in currency translation adjustments for foreign base sales. The company opened eight new stores in the quarter, four each for Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, including one Urban Outfitters in Europe, bringing the total new stores opened for the year to 33.Within the quarter, comparable store sales were positive each month but strongest in December. By region, sales in Anthropologie were positive in all locations but strongest in the Northeast and South. In comparison, sales at Urban Outfitters are strongest in the Midwest and lagged on the West Coast. By store venue, sales in Anthropologie were uniform across all types, whereas sales at Urban Outfitters was strongest in mall locations.The company's comp store sales performance was driven by a 4% increase in transactions and a 4% increase in average unit selling price, which more than offset a 4% decrease in average unit per transaction. By brand, the number of transactions increased 8%, 25% and 2% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Average unit selling prices increased 14% at Anthropologie and decreased 8% and 2% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Finally, units per transaction were flat at Urban Outfitters and down 11% and 4% at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales increased 28% to $112 million despite a strategic circulation decrease of 18%. The penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased nearly two percentage points to 19%, highlighting a secular shift in the way our customers shopping. The results was driven by more than $26 million website visits, a gain of 27% or $5.5 million additional visits.The Direct-To-Consumer channel was double digit positive across all brands, and our strategic investments in assortment, site experience, fulfillment and social media continue to yield high returns. Since the Direct-To-Consumer channel is becoming such a meaningful part of each brands revenue, effective next quarter, the company will begin to report comparable Retail segment sales by brand and will limit comparable retail store sales information to the total company's performance.By Merchandise category, Women's Apparel and Accessories led the pace in Anthropologie and Men's and Women's Apparel were strongest at Urban Outfitters. As we've communicated consistently throughout the year, they were powerful fashion cues in our business and our customers continue to discriminate by responding to newness, scarcity and great authentic design. Our comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarters end. The brand presidents are very comfortable with our inventory position. And as I had mentioned before, they will continue to focus on achieving appropriate reductions in our inventory weeks-of-supply because we believe it positively impacts the customer experience and ultimately results in improvement to maintain margins.I'd like to now turn your attention to our Wholesale segment for the fourth quarter. With the addition of Leifsdottir, revenue declined by 2% to $23 million due primarily to a strategic reduction in clearance sales. Free People's Wholesale revenue decreased by 5% to $21.9 million with sales to specialty stores increasing 7%, sales to department stores decreasing 2% and sales to clearance outlet decreasing 28%. The brand's average unit selling price increased 17% while unit sales declined 19%, driven primarily by the reduction in closeout sales. Leifsdottir Wholesale revenue increased 77% to $1.6 million, and we continue to gain confidence in the brand's long-term potential.I'd like to now turn your attention to gross margin operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter increased 771 basis points to 41.7%, driven largely by gains in initial margin and a reduction in markdowns to clear seasonal product. Let me reiterate that over the long term, we believe we have additional initial margin opportunity, an opportunity to reduce markdown levels to our historic average.The organization continued to exhibit exceptional discipline in managing expenses while simultaneously making strategic investment in design, the supply chain, technology, our Direct-To-Consumer businesses and our European infrastructure. Total selling, general and administrative costs for the quarter as a percentage of sales decreased by one basis points to 21.6% despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings.The company generated an impressive 20% operating margin, earning a record $119 million of income from operations, an increase of 88% versus the same quarter last year. We also achieved our highest ever net income for a quarter, $78 million, an increase of 92% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.45. The company's annual effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% versus 35.6% for the prior year.The increase in the current year rate is primarily attributable to a lower proportion of tax-free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior year's holdings. The company estimates that next year's annual effective tax rate will be approximately 35.8%. We expect a favorable change in next year's rate will be due in part to an increase in income generated from foreign operations.We've just completed the year that most of us will never forget. A year that was extraordinary in so many ways and a true test of our organization. I think it's fair to say that our company experienced the impact of the 2008 economic reset later than many of our peers. Given our exceptional fourth quarter results, I believe it's also accurate to say that we adjusted to the reset faster than many of our peers. Let me remind you that our business grew 22% in 2008, that we finished the year with an 8% comparable store sales gain and a 32% increase in our Direct-To-Consumer channel. It wasn't until the fourth quarter of 2008 that our performance decelerated to a 1% comp sales declined and 20% Direct-To-Consumer sales growth. We reached the nadir of this cycle the following quarter, the first quarter of 2009 with a 10% comp sales decline and Direct-To-Consumer growth of just 4%. The organization reacted swiftly to the unprecedented challenge. And as soon as the environment began to stabilize, they were able to read patterns in the business and respond accordingly.Driven by the team's effective efforts, the trend improved in each quarter throughout 2009, culminating in our record fourth quarter performance. I'm equally pleased to announce that our current February sales results exceeded our fourth quarter performance, which gives us confidence that our strategies have taken firm hold.  These are the results of an exceptional organization, an organization characterized by passion, tenacity, intellect, agility, discipline, creativity and alignment. I believe these results also highlight the efficacy of our operating model and strategy. And for that, I offer the organization appreciation to Dick and the Board. Before I close the call, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing our priorities for the year. We have four key initiatives, and I'll touch on each of them briefly. Our first focus is driving continuing gains in four wall productivity. If we can continue our historic 10-year average comp rate over the next decade, we'll drive an incremental $1.2 billion to the company's top line. Our strategies include making continued improvements in four key areas: Right product, right time, right place, right price, site selection and store design, store operations and marketing, including the launch of our cross-channel database.Our next priority is to continue to drive our E-Commerce business resulting in a higher penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to total company sales. We're unwilling to set a limit to the level of penetration and we are increasingly channel agnostic, as to how the customer reaches us. Our strategies for the year revolve around making iterative and disruptive changes to our online merchandise content, continuing to improve our websites, continuing to increase access to our brands through a Mobile technology, continuing to improve fulfillment operations and continuing to mind social media.Our third priority is international expansion. We have every indication that the company can achieve an appropriate level of profit and productivity in Europe. Urban Outfitters has made great strides over the last several years including a successful entry into Germany and a thriving launch of e-commerce. Anthropologie open very successfully in London last fall, and it's about to open its second London location and launch its e-commerce site this month. And Free People will begin the course of European Wholesale expansion in the current year. Andrew McLean, the company's Chief Operating Officer for Europe is leading many of our European infrastructure and tactical improvement initiatives, including comprehensive market research and due diligence, the design and implementation of a logistics and fulfillment strategy, upgrades our Retail and Direct-To-Consumer operating systems and so on.We have also begun to lay the groundwork for the company's expansion to the Far East. It is unlikely that we will have anything definitive to report in the near future, but we are targeting a calendar 2012 or 2013 launch.Our fourth and final priority is adding new brands to the Urban portfolio. We see our companies as a group of niche brands. And because we feel so strongly that scarcity creates value, we envision the company will be comprised of a minimum of six significant brands over the next 10 years. To that end, we are advancing our efforts with Leifsdottir. We launched the Leifsdottir website two weeks ago. We plan to launch shoes and handbags or shipment [ph] in the beginning of 2011. And we expect to open our first retail store in 2011.It's still too early in the brands development to talk about long-term potential, but the early signs continue to be extremely positive. We were also very pleased with the progress that Terrain made during the fourth quarter. I have said repeatedly that Terrain reminds me of Anthropologie in the early days. The customer loves it. And our enthusiasm for the experience is now generating significant increases in comp sales. Terrain team is confident that they can maintain the positive momentum. I am also pleased to announce that the company will be launching its next brand on Valentine's Day 2011. A wedding lifestyle concept that we hope will be as innovative as our existing brands. We plan to sell an event-based assortment of heirloom wedding gowns, bridesmaid and special occasion dresses, shoes, bags and accessories, intimate apparel, imitation, decor and gifts. We also expect to offer a community for brides before, during and after the wedding. The brand will initially launch with the website followed by a store opening later in the year. Of course, none of these initiatives happen without people. And I'd like to take a moment to announce three important promotions in the company.I couldn't be more pleased to recognize Barbara Rozsas who was just promoted to Chief Sourcing Officer, and Wendy Wurtzburger and Wendy McDevitt who were just been promoted to Co-President over the Anthropologie brand. Collectively, these three women have more than 40 years with our company, and they are each best of class at what they do. There is not a day that goes by when Barbara, Wendy and Wendy don't make our organization better, nor is there a day that goes by, when they don't teach me something or make me a better leader.The organization and I are profoundly grateful to their commitment, and it is a joy to publicly recognize their extraordinary contribution to our company. I firmly believe we are a better company today than we were a year ago, and I hope that I have conveyed the sense of optimism we are feeling. As we have often stated, the company's overarching goal is constant and simple, to grow revenue by at least 20%, to grow profit at a faster rate than sales, and to reach a minimum of 20% operating margin.And as always, the leadership team and I I'll look forward to continuing to inspire our customers and reward our shareholders and employees alike. I will now open the call to questions. And as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourself to one question. Thank you."

It's the strategy that we have around product, around the site itself, around fulfillment and around social media. And also around Mobile, so active [ph] to the site. So if I talk about each of those things briefly with product, we've made iterative changes to the assortments. And by that, I mean adding things like additional sizes or inseams, expanding assortment where we don't have the physical constraints of a brick-and-mortar store. We've also begun to make disruptive changes to the assortment. So by that, I mean things that we believe are appropriate for each of our customers in each of our brands, but things that we wouldn't normally carry on a store. So kind of a minor example of that might be swimsuit in Anthropologie. A more significant example of that might be the bicycles that Urban Outfitters offered this past season. So that's the product offer. Then you start to look at the websites themselves. Each of our brands have gone through multiple site redesigns over the last several years. As you know we launched ATG two years ago, which both are Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie run on. Free People runs on a different system. But what all the systems do is they allow the sites to be much more sticky, much more user-friendly, the checkout process is simpler. The analytics that we have to drive the business are more robust and so on. And I mentioned Mobile, all of our brands have some version of Mobile Access. Free People right now, I believe, probably is leading the way, but the other two brands will have Mobile sites that they're very happy with in the next several months. Social media, we've done a great job with. I think in North America alone, we've collected over 200,000 names on Facebook between our three brands. I was just looking at some data yesterday. We're really using the blogs effectively. Free People actually launched rating, reviews mix[ph] what I think maybe a year and a half ago. Urban followed suit, Anthropologie launched it in the middle of last year that's been tremendously effective. So we've gotten smarter and smarter about how to monetize all the opportunities around social media. And then lastly, fulfillment. We're very mindful of the fact that some of our e-tailer benchmarks have done a sensational job with the whole concept of the fabs and free [ph]. That's an area that we're testing. We'll be very methodical about it. But certainly, the kind of boundaries to direct response buying are shrinking in the last several years. And with all of those things, paper is just going away. I don't think it's going away overnight. But I think 10 years from now, it will probably be gone. And I think you're seeing that in the world of magazine publishing. You're seeing that in many, many other areas. So we're just trying to stay current. It's a very, very exciting time for us."

Markdowns are clearly higher from quarter-to-quarter just based on the seasonality of our business. As we look into fourth quarter comparisons, the improvement driven the 771 basis point improvement, it was really shared by markup and marked down almost equally with a slight advantage to markup. And we leveraged the occupancy with a positive comp as well. So looking forward, the company has made great strides in IMU improvement. But as you point, we do have opportunities in the markdown compared to our historical rates and, we'll continue to focus on that. And when it comes to the mix of business driven on the private side, I think we see slight improvement but not dramatic improvement going into fiscal '11."

They have clearly had better growth than we've had in the last decade. And we're not an Amazon, there are marketplace in a technology company. And we're a group of brands. But I'd certainly want to learn from Amazon. I want to learn from the off-price auction sites. I want to learn from Facebook. And we're really having a lot of conversations internally that talk about the fact that the e-commerce world is probably long term the best representation of who we are as a brand. Historically, if you think about this, we started as a brick-and-mortar retailer. We introduced Wholesale. It was only a dozen years ago that we introduced this catalog to the company, and we jokingly recall I think it was maybe eight, nine years ago when Michael Robinson, who now runs the Anthropologie direct in Europe, carried the HP computer on his back into his office to run the direct-to-consumer systems. So we're moving maybe not as quickly as Amazon. But relative to where we've come from, we think we're moving quickly. So the kinds of the improvements we're making are focused in the areas that I talked about. I think you'll see much more around product innovation on all of our sites and all of our brands. And I think you'll see us testing new categories that we believe our customer brand appropriate but that you wouldn't see in the stores. I think you'll see a lot of interesting things happen in our websites. We don't have a lot of video, for example, right now. And I'm sure you've all read the impact that video has on conversion. I think you'll see us do a lot more with social media. I think you'll see us texting this whole concept of past and pre. The Merkle database, which I'm sure someone's going to ask me about, I think we'll have a profound impact on our Direct-to-consumer business. And the other thing we're not really -- I've talked about on earlier calls is how our e-commerce in websites can synergistically impact our brick-and-mortar Retail business. Remember, the only way we have to talk to our Retail of customers, which is still north of 80% of our business right now is through catalogs and kind of general e-mails, but they're not targeted. So when we have Merkle up and running, which will happened at the end of the year, we'll be able to understand exactly what impact we get out of every e-mail that we send or every Facebook that we manage. So I hope that gives you some clarity. With regard to the SG&A, I'll wait for someone else to answer the question."

We managed the weeks to supply, not to absolute inventory levels. So right now, the total comp inventories were down 3%.

But as I've said in my prepared comments, each of the brand presidents feel very, very comfortable with where the inventories are. Over the long term, meaning over the next three to five years, I'd like to see a continued reductions in weeks of supply as we get up and running with our trade stone, software systems, as we continue to make improvements in our planning and allocation systems. And the reason why we all feel so strongly about that is because we think it will, as I said my prepared comments, improve the customer experience, of the less the store has to handle the product, the more time they can spend with the customer, the crisper and cleaner and fresher the product is and so on. And of course the benefit of that is improved merchandise margins. So we've had a lot of help from the sourcing group over last couple of years, reducing our weeks of supply. And that's really what you're seeing in the numbers. And I think we'll continue to see improvements there."

I think that I know we've talked about that in general terms, the differences between the four walls, brick-and-mortar profitability and the Wholesale profitability and the direct profitability. And we are absolutely most profitable in the Direct business. So it's a nice thing that we continue to gain penetration. Having said that, we are making a lot of investment in the direct area as we develop our plans for the current year. We didn't plan to deleverage in many areas but one of the areas that we did plan to deleverage slightly is in the IT area. Calvin is sitting to my right. And I know I'm sure someone's going to ask some of the IT initiatives at some point. But Calvin's got a lot on his plate, much of which will impact the Direct business. We also remember North America, we have only one fulfillment center. We're looking to add a second fulfillment center this year. We're also looking to go from third-party fulfillment to in-house fulfillment in Europe. I think it's likely that we'll get to at least two fulfillment centers pretty quickly in Europe. So I think it'll continue to be the most profitable channel, but we're also looking to make investments. Because when Eric came in, one of the first things he did was look at the return on investment of every dollar we spent. And obviously, given the kind of profitability, our ROI in the Direct-to-consumer business, it averages about two to three times better than any dollar we spend anywhere else in the company. So we're going to be spending money there."

Of course, the Direct business at Free People is much more important to the total Free People Retail segment that it is at Urban and Anthro because Free People has far fewer stores. But the way that customers toggle between a store one day, a website another day, a mobile experience the third day, is very, very consistent. And it's counterintuitive. Because like you, I would've thought that the Urban customer would've been the earliest adopter. But things are moving very, very quickly for the 30 to 45 group. I'm sure you know at Facebook, the fastest-growing component of Facebook users is that 35 to 45 or 30 to 45 year-old customer. Actually the fastest growing segment of online games is women aged 30 to 45. So it's pretty surprising how quickly this is all taking hold."

And I think that's the improvement that you saw from quarter-to-quarter and the tremendous fourth quarter is really a result of the use of creativity to reconnect with the customer. So this is not -- the creative manifestation doesn't just happen with new brands. It happens with rebirth of each of our brands and quite friendly, almost everyday. We have many things in this organization. One is that the only thing that's constant is changed. Another thing, if you look in the rearview mirror more than once every seven seconds, you get into a car accident. Nothing is more boring than last year's best-seller. I mean we are an the organization who constantly moves forward and redefines ourselves. And we're true to Dick's vision from decades ago. But it's the Concept division. It's not the Execution division, that has to change. We drive our business with newness, not with price. So and just to build on what you said, there's so many fun things about working for this company but probably the most fun thing is working with the creative folks in this organization because they are absolute best of class.

And as I've said in the prepared remarks, it's pretty staggering. But if we can average the 7% comp for the next 10 years like we've averaged for the last 10 years, we'll drive $1,200,000,000 of incremental revenue to the top line. And you all listening to this call understands the profitability of that $1,200,000,000 of revenues. We have many strategies for doing that. The strategies revolving around getting the right product, in the right place at the right time and the right price. And that relates to sourcing strategies, planning and allocation strategies and so on. Our second kind of area with driving retail productivity relates to store design and site selection. Our third is store operations. And the fourth and probably the most impactful is the database that will allow us to manage our Retail business with a much higher level of optics than we have today. So that's number one. Number two is e-commerce. I don't want to limit, how big a business, how much of our business e-commerce can be. If you ask me five or eight years ago, if it could be more than 20% of the business, I probably would've said no. Last year, internally, we were saying it would be somewhere between 20% to 30% likely in all likelihood. Today, we're not going to be limit it to 30%. It could be more than 30%. We're just going to keep doing everything we can do to drive that business. We have internal goals that are very, very aggressive. International, as I said in my prepared comments, we have every indication based on the success of Urban Outfitters and the launch of Anthropologie that we can be as profitable as we need to be in Europe. Also based on the research we've done in the Far East, we think the same holds true for there. So we are going as quickly as we can in Europe. Andrew has done a great job laying the infrastructure, which we need to have in place before we put the pedal to the metal so to speak. But I think you'll see us start to open the stores more quickly. And you'll certainly see us ramp-up our e-commerce business very aggressively in Europe and other parts of the world. And then lastly, new brands. As I've said in the prepared comments, something that Dick and the board and I and the senior team here feel unbelievably passionate about is this idea that scarcity creates value. We never want anyone of our brands to become so big that they lose their specialness in the customer's minds. And as a result, we absolutely need additional brands to achieve our URBN objectives. So now with wedding, that's our sixth brands. As I said, I think we need a 10-year plan, we need 68 meaningful brands. I don't know, I don't want to -- I'll give a range on what meaningful means. I'd say not less than $500 million and probably more than $1 billion. And that's potential, not actual results in 10 years. So we're very, very committed to launching these brands that all share the URBN sensibility, DNA business approach and so on. So these four overall growth objectives are something that we've talked about continually. There's probably not a person, an employee in the organization who doesn't know about these. I blog about them. We have brown bag lunches about them. And people are very, very excited about them."

Glen mentioned trades turned up PLM system. They're probably now in the rollout phase. We have some domestic vendors on that. And in two weeks, we're traveling over to Asia to get of all of our own brand manufacturers on trade as well. That would give increased visibility on the logistics side. We expect to have all of our vendors on that by Q3 or Q4 or a great portion of that to get help in the whole weeks of supply. The customer cross channel database, as Glen mentioned, we'll get a cross channel view of the customer. We are on track to roll it out towards the end of the year. I'm hopeful that we'll get it out at the late part of Q3. I'm not sure if it will have a significance or any impact on Q4, would be doubtful. We are on track, rolling it out as well. Single SKU, a huge initiative to get single SKU between our retail and our direct channel. That is on track. We are hoping to get our first grand Leifsdottir up on single SKU in the second quarter followed by Free People, and then have all brands on single SKU by next year. What that gives us is the ability to better fulfill demand, to go out of stock in the store, to fulfill that demand from a different store or from the online channel. And conversely, if we have a demand online that we can order online, pick it up in the store or fulfill from a different fulfillment center. So again, huge capabilities. We hope to begin to see that impact sometime next year."

The way we think about it in all of our brands is the more we know about our customers, the more we can do for our customers. Personalization is one of the biggest trends in technology right now.

And everyone who's listening to this call probably know much more about that than I do. So I don't think we're out of the woods. I think the difference between today and a year ago was that there's much more stability. I mean none of us knew what was going to happen a year ago. Those of us who have any kind of savings saw our savings accounts just go down by 50%. We hadproperty. Many of us had real estate issues. We were under water. And I think that has quieted down a bit. So I think people have more of a sense of certainty. But I don't think that spending is going to return to 2007 levels. And I tend to think about things simply because I think it's easier to get things done when you simplify. I keep saying if a customer spent $100 on an average outing in 2007, she's spending $90 today. So we have to be 10% or 11% better than we were in 2007 to be flat. And I think we have to be 15% or 20% better to become positive. And that's how we think about it internally. We, as a company, we don't talk about weather. We don't talk about the economy. We have just a culture of constant growth. And we will grow or we will endeavor to grow however we need to. And we just had to be better. I think I spoke either on the last earnings call or the one before that about the customers being more discriminating. She is. She has more off-price merchandise available to her. I think a lot of the off-price retailers have done a great job. She has more information available than ever, and she's using the Internet to make brick-and-mortar decisions now so she can shop price easily. We just have to be better. We have to offer better product and a better experience. And I think that's what we did, and I think that's why we had a good fourth quarter. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. I think we're going to be years before we get back to the confidence levels that we had in 2006, 2007."

And we talk about things all the time. And we listen to each other, and just quite frankly, there's just a lot of internal enthusiasm where there initially was a lot of internal enthusiasm around the idea of wedding. Now It just so happens that in, specially at Free People and Anthropologie, a lot of bridesmaids or people going to a wedding shop those brands for wedding dresses, accessories and so on. And so not only do we hear about it internally, we also hear about it from our customers. So that's kind of stage one. Stage two is we begin to do due diligence. And most of you probably know something about the wedding industry, and I'm doing this from memory. So Wendy, is telling me yes or no if I get this wrong, but I think it's roughly about a $60 billion business. I think the average spend in North America on a wedding is about $45,000. I think the average bride spends about $4,500 all in, including her clothing. So that's the average. That's not the kind of customer that we reach. So we've done a lot of research. We've spoken to a lot of people about it. And like everything we do, we try to marry art and gut. We think this is going to be meaningful business. Anyone we talk to about this goes, wow, that sounds exciting. So we think it's going to be meaningful, but you know what the customers is going to tell us, that we're going to be very, very careful and methodical and conservative in how we launch it. And the customers are going to show us the way, just as she is with Terrain and Leifsdottir right now. But back to Barbara Wyckoff's question, we have a lot of ideas in this company. There are a lot of creative people. And there are a lot of kind of things that people have to say. And I'm sure you'll see more good ideas come out of this company."

And really kind of engineer across right down to the fractions of a cent. Those of you who negotiate, most of you know that an educated negotiator is a good negotiator. So the more information that the product group has at their fingertips, I think the better they'll be able to do. Long term really, what you want to do is negotiate a margin agreement with your suppliers. You don't want to negotiate on, you just want the cost to be the cost and agree on what the markup's going to be. So I'm sure we'll get there at some point."

So we made a lot of progress there. But what I can tell you is the people that I speak with who have international experience, Eric who just joined us, his predecessor company was 25% international. Most people I speak to are actually more profitable internationally than they are in North America. So that's not true for us. But we're very motivated by that knowledge, and we're working very hard to kind of uncover all the opportunities. As Eric said earlier, the next couple of years is absolutely going to be about investments. Let me remind everyone that virtually everything we do in Europe is done through third-party service providers. And that's typically more expensive and not as good as when you do it yourself. So we are very methodically bringing all of the things that we do in house in America, like logistics and systems, in-house in Europe over the next couple of years. So we'll be a phase of investment, but we believe we'll have good returns on those investments.  So again we've had a limit of technology challenges here, so we can't see who's still on the call. But I just want to thank everyone for being with us, great questions today. And as always, thanks for your support we look forward to seeing you all. Have a great day."

Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and our Senior Team, including the majority of our brand and shared service leads.Earlier today, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and 12-month period ending January 31, 2010. I will begin today's call by reading prepared commentary regarding our performance, then the group and I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As usual, you will be able to access the text of today's conference call on our corporate website at www.urbanoutfittersinc.com.We are delighted to report a series of record-breaking results for the quarter and for the year. The following summarizes our fourth quarter fiscal 2010 performance versus the comparable quarter last year.Net sales increased 16% to $589 million, the largest quarterly revenue performance in our history. Income from operations grew 88% to a record $119 million, resulting in a best-ever fourth quarter operating margin of 20%. Net income increased 92% to a record $78 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Comparable Retail segment sales, which includes our Direct-To-Consumer channel, rose by 9%. Comparable store sales increased 4%. Comp sales at Urban Outfitters were flat, and comp sales at Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain rose by 10%, 11% and 23%, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales soared 28% despite a strategic 18% reduction in circulation with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale segment revenues declined 2% to $23 million. Gross profit margins increased 771 basis points, driven by significant gains in initial margins and reductions in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product.Comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarter's end. Selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales declined one basis point for the period despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $224 million to $745 million. I'll begin this morning by providing more detail on each of their key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales.New and non-comparable store sales contributed $40 million, including a gain of $3 million in currency translation adjustments for foreign base sales. The company opened eight new stores in the quarter, four each for Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, including one Urban Outfitters in Europe, bringing the total new stores opened for the year to 33.Within the quarter, comparable store sales were positive each month but strongest in December. By region, sales in Anthropologie were positive in all locations but strongest in the Northeast and South. In comparison, sales at Urban Outfitters are strongest in the Midwest and lagged on the West Coast. By store venue, sales in Anthropologie were uniform across all types, whereas sales at Urban Outfitters was strongest in mall locations.The company's comp store sales performance was driven by a 4% increase in transactions and a 4% increase in average unit selling price, which more than offset a 4% decrease in average unit per transaction. By brand, the number of transactions increased 8%, 25% and 2% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Average unit selling prices increased 14% at Anthropologie and decreased 8% and 2% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Finally, units per transaction were flat at Urban Outfitters and down 11% and 4% at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales increased 28% to $112 million despite a strategic circulation decrease of 18%. The penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased nearly two percentage points to 19%, highlighting a secular shift in the way our customers shopping. The results was driven by more than $26 million website visits, a gain of 27% or $5.5 million additional visits.The Direct-To-Consumer channel was double digit positive across all brands, and our strategic investments in assortment, site experience, fulfillment and social media continue to yield high returns. Since the Direct-To-Consumer channel is becoming such a meaningful part of each brands revenue, effective next quarter, the company will begin to report comparable Retail segment sales by brand and will limit comparable retail store sales information to the total company's performance.By Merchandise category, Women's Apparel and Accessories led the pace in Anthropologie and Men's and Women's Apparel were strongest at Urban Outfitters. As we've communicated consistently throughout the year, they were powerful fashion cues in our business and our customers continue to discriminate by responding to newness, scarcity and great authentic design. Our comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarters end. The brand presidents are very comfortable with our inventory position. And as I had mentioned before, they will continue to focus on achieving appropriate reductions in our inventory weeks-of-supply because we believe it positively impacts the customer experience and ultimately results in improvement to maintain margins.I'd like to now turn your attention to our Wholesale segment for the fourth quarter. With the addition of Leifsdottir, revenue declined by 2% to $23 million due primarily to a strategic reduction in clearance sales. Free People's wholesale revenue decreased by 5% to $21.9 million with sales to specialty stores increasing 7%, sales to department stores decreasing 2% and sales to clearance outlets decreasing 28%. The brand's average unit selling price increased 17% while unit sales declined 19%, driven primarily by the reduction in closeout sales. Leifsdottir's wholesale revenue increased 77% to $1.6 million, and we continue to gain confidence in the brand's long-term potential.I'd like to now turn your attention to gross margin operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter increased 771 basis points to 41.7%, driven largely by gains in initial margin and a reduction in markdowns to clear seasonal product. Let me reiterate that over the long term, we believe we have additional initial margin opportunity, an opportunity to reduce markdown levels to our historic average.The organization continued to exhibit exceptional discipline in managing expenses while simultaneously making strategic investment in design, the supply chain, technology, our Direct-To-Consumer businesses and our European infrastructure. Total selling, general and administrative costs for the quarter as a percentage of sales decreased by one basis point to 21.6% despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings.The company generated an impressive 20% operating margin, earning a record $119 million of income from operations, an increase of 88% versus the same quarter last year. We also achieved our highest ever net income for a quarter, $78 million, an increase of 92% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.45. The company's annual effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% versus 35.6% for the prior year.The increase in the current year rate is primarily attributable to a lower proportion of tax-free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior year's holdings. The company estimates that next year's annual effective tax rate will be approximately 35.8%. The expected favorable change in next year's rate will be due in part to an increase in income generated from foreign operations.We've just completed the year that most of us will never forget. A year that was extraordinary in so many ways and a true test of our organization. I think it's fair to say that our company experienced the impact of the 2008 economic reset later than many of our peers. Given our exceptional fourth quarter results, I believe it's also accurate to say that we adjusted to the reset faster than many of our peers. Let me remind you that our business grew 22% in 2008, that we finished the year with an 8% comparable store sales gain and a 32% increase in our Direct-To-Consumer channel. It wasn't until the fourth quarter of 2008 that our performance decelerated to a 1% comp sales decline and 20% Direct-To-Consumer sales growth. We reached the nadir of this cycle the following quarter, the first quarter of 2009 with a 10% comp sales decline and Direct-To-Consumer growth of just 4%. The organization reacted swiftly to the unprecedented challenge. And as soon as the environment began to stabilize, they were able to read patterns in the business and respond accordingly.Driven by the team's effective efforts, the trend improved in each quarter throughout 2009, culminating in our record fourth quarter performance. I'm equally pleased to announce that our current February sales results exceeded our fourth quarter performance, which gives us confidence that our strategies have taken firm hold. These are the results of an exceptional organization, an organization characterized by passion, tenacity, intellect, agility, discipline, creativity and alignment. I believe these results also highlight the efficacy of our operating model and strategy. And for that, I offer the organization's appreciation to Dick and the Board. Before I close the call, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing our priorities for the year. We have four key initiatives, and I'll touch on each of them briefly. Our first focus is driving continuing gains in four wall productivity. If we can continue our historic 10-year average comp rate over the next decade, we'll drive an incremental $1.2 billion to the company's top line. Our strategies include making continued improvements in four key areas: Right product, right time, right place, right price, site selection and store design, store operations and marketing, including the launch of our cross-channel database.Our next priority is to continue to drive our E-Commerce business resulting in a higher penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to total company sales. We're unwilling to set a limit to the level of penetration and we're increasingly channel agnostic, as to how the customer reaches us. Our strategies for the year revolve around making iterative and disruptive changes to our online merchandise content, continuing to improve our websites, continuing to increase access to our brands through a Mobile technology, continuing to improve fulfillment operations and continuing to mind social media.Our third priority is international expansion. We have every indication that the company can achieve an appropriate level of profit and productivity in Europe. Urban Outfitters has made great strides over the last several years including a successful entry into Germany and a thriving launch of e-commerce. Anthropologie opened very successfully in London last fall, and it's about to open its second London location and launch its e-commerce site this month. And Free People will begin the course of European Wholesale expansion in the current year. Andrew McLean, the company's Chief Operating Officer for Europe is leading many of our European infrastructure and tactical improvement initiatives, including comprehensive market research and due diligence, the design and implementation of a logistics and fulfillment strategy, upgrades to our Retail and Direct-To-Consumer operating systems and so on.We have also begun to lay the groundwork for the company's expansion to the Far East. It is unlikely that we will have anything definitive to report in the near future, but we are targeting a calendar 2012 or 2013 launch.Our fourth and final priority is adding new brands to the Urban portfolio. We see our companies as a group of niche brands. And because we feel so strongly that scarcity creates value, we envision the company will be comprised of a minimum of six significant brands over the next 10 years. To that end, we are advancing our efforts with Leifsdottir. We launched the Leifsdottir website two weeks ago. We plan to launch shoes and handbags for shipment in the beginning of 2011. And we expect to open our first retail store in 2011.It's still too early in the brands development to talk about long-term potential, but the early signs continue to be extremely positive. We were also very pleased with the progress that Terrain made during the fourth quarter. I have said repeatedly that Terrain reminds me of Anthropologie in the early days. The customer loves it. And our enthusiasm for the experience is now generating significant increases in comp sales. Terrain team is confident that they can maintain the positive momentum. I am also pleased to announce that the company will be launching its next brand on Valentine's Day 2011. A wedding lifestyle concept that we hope will be as innovative as our existing brands. We plan to sell an event-based assortment of heirloom wedding gowns, bridesmaid and special occasion dresses, shoes, bags and accessories, intimate apparel, imitation, decor and gifts. We also expect to offer a community for brides before, during and after the wedding. The brand will initially launch with the website followed by a store opening later in the year. Of course, none of these initiatives happen without people. And I'd like to take a moment to announce three important promotions in the company.I couldn't be more pleased to recognize Barbara Rozsas who was just promoted to Chief Sourcing Officer, and Wendy Wurtzburger and Wendy McDevitt who were just been promoted to Co-President over the Anthropologie brand. Collectively, these three women have more than 40 years with our company, and they are each best of class at what they do. There is not a day that goes by when Barbara, Wendy and Wendy don't make our organization better, nor is there a day that goes by, when they don't teach me something or make me a better leader.The organization and I are profoundly grateful to their commitment, and it is a joy to publicly recognize their extraordinary contribution to our company. I firmly believe we are a better company today than we were a year ago, and I hope that I have conveyed the sense of optimism we are feeling. As we have often stated, the company's overarching goal is constant and simple, to grow revenue by at least 20%, to grow profit at a faster rate than sales, and to reach a minimum of 20% operating margin.And as always, the leadership team and I I'll look forward to continuing to inspire our customers and reward our shareholders and employees alike. I will now open the call to questions. And as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourself to one question. Thank you."

It's the strategy that we have around product, around the site itself, around fulfillment and around social media. And also around Mobile, so active [ph] to the site. So if I talk about each of those things briefly with product, we've made iterative changes to the assortments. And by that, I mean adding things like additional sizes or inseams, expanding assortment where we don't have the physical constraints of a brick-and-mortar store. We've also begun to make disruptive changes to the assortment. So by that, I mean things that we believe are appropriate for each of our customers in each of our brands, but things that we wouldn't normally carry on a store. So kind of a minor example of that might be swimsuit in Anthropologie. A more significant example of that might be the bicycles that Urban Outfitters offered this past season. So that's the product offer. Then you start to look at the websites themselves. Each of our brands have gone through multiple site redesigns over the last several years. As you know we launched ATG two years ago, which both are Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie run on. Free People runs on a different system. But what all the systems do is they allow the sites to be much more sticky, much more user-friendly, the checkout process is simpler. The analytics that we have to drive the business are more robust and so on. And I mentioned Mobile, all of our brands have some version of Mobile Access. Free People right now, I believe, probably is leading the way, but the other two brands will have Mobile sites that they're very happy with in the next several months. Social media, we've done a great job with. I think in North America alone, we've collected over 200,000 names on Facebook between our three brands. I was just looking at some data yesterday. We're really using the blogs effectively. Free People actually launched rating, reviews mix[ph] what I think maybe a year and a half ago. Urban followed suit, Anthropologie launched it in the middle of last year that's been tremendously effective. So we've gotten smarter and smarter about how to monetize all the opportunities around social media. And then lastly, fulfillment. We're very mindful of the fact that some of our e-tailer benchmarks have done a sensational job with the whole concept of the fabs and free [ph]. That's an area that we're testing. We'll be very methodical about it. But certainly, the kind of boundaries to direct response buying are shrinking in the last several years. And with all of those things, paper is just going away. I don't think it's going away overnight. But I think 10 years from now, it will probably be gone. And I think you're seeing that in the world of magazine publishing. You're seeing that in many, many other areas. So we're just trying to stay current. It's a very, very exciting time for us."

Our markup is rather consistent from the third quarter and to the fourth quarter. So that's one piece of information. Markdowns are clearly higher from quarter-to-quarter just based on the seasonality of our business. As we look into fourth quarter comparisons, the improvement driven the 771 basis point improvement, it was really shared by markup and marked down almost equally with a slight advantage to markup. And we leveraged the occupancy with a positive comp as well. So looking forward, the company has made great strides in IMU improvement. But as you point, we do have opportunities in the markdown compared to our historical rates and, we'll continue to focus on that. And when it comes to the mix of business driven on the private side, I think we see slight improvement but not dramatic improvement going into fiscal '11."

We do not benchmark ourselves against legacy brick-and-mortar retailers. We are benchmarking ourselves against e-tailers. And so when you look at an Amazon and this is off the top of my head, but since I think they're doing about $25 billion this year. They have clearly had better growth than we've had in the last decade. And we're not an Amazon, there are marketplace in a technology company. And we're a group of brands. But I'd certainly want to learn from Amazon. I want to learn from the off-price auction sites. I want to learn from Facebook. And we're really having a lot of conversations internally that talk about the fact that the e-commerce world is probably long term the best representation of who we are as a brand. Historically, if you think about this, we started as a brick-and-mortar retailer. We introduced Wholesale. It was only a dozen years ago that we introduced this catalog to the company, and we jokingly recall I think it was maybe eight, nine years ago when Michael Robinson, who now runs the Anthropologie direct in Europe, carried the HP computer on his back into his office to run the direct-to-consumer systems. So we're moving maybe not as quickly as Amazon. But relative to where we've come from, we think we're moving quickly. So the kinds of the improvements we're making are focused in the areas that I talked about. I think you'll see much more around product innovation on all of our sites and all of our brands. And I think you'll see us testing new categories that we believe our customer brand appropriate but that you wouldn't see in the stores. I think you'll see a lot of interesting things happen in our websites. We don't have a lot of video, for example, right now. And I'm sure you've all read the impact that video has on conversion. I think you'll see us do a lot more with social media. I think you'll see us texting this whole concept of past and pre. The Merkle database, which I'm sure someone's going to ask me about, I think we'll have a profound impact on our Direct-to-consumer business. And the other thing we're not really -- I've talked about on earlier calls is how our e-commerce in websites can synergistically impact our brick-and-mortar Retail business. Remember, the only way we have to talk to our Retail of customers, which is still north of 80% of our business right now is through catalogs and kind of general e-mails, but they're not targeted. So when we have Merkle up and running, which will happened at the end of the year, we'll be able to understand exactly what impact we get out of every e-mail that we send or every Facebook that we manage. So I hope that gives you some clarity. With regard to the SG&A, I'll wait for someone else to answer the question."

We managed the weeks to supply, not to absolute inventory levels. So right now, the total comp inventories were down 3%.

But as I've said in my prepared comments, each of the brand presidents feel very, very comfortable with where the inventories are. Over the long term, meaning over the next three to five years, I'd like to see a continued reduction in weeks of supply as we get up and running with our trade stone, software systems, as we continue to make improvements in our planning and allocation systems. And the reason why we all feel so strongly about that is because we think it will, as I said in my prepared comments, improve the customer experience, the less the store has to handle the product, the more time they can spend with the customer, the crisper and cleaner and fresher the product is and so on. And of course the benefit of that is improved merchandise margins. So we've had a lot of help from the sourcing group over the last couple of years, reducing our weeks of supply.

And we are absolutely most profitable in the Direct business. So it's a nice thing that we continue to gain penetration. Having said that, we are making a lot of investments in the direct area as we developed our plans for the current year. We didn't plan to deleverage in many areas but one of the areas that we did plan to deleverage slightly is in the IT area. Calvin is sitting to my right. And I know I'm sure someone's going to ask some of the IT initiatives at some point. But Calvin's got a lot on his plate, much of which will impact the Direct business. We also remember North America, we have only one fulfillment center. We're looking to add a second fulfillment center this year. We're also looking to go from third-party fulfillment to in-house fulfillment in Europe. I think it's likely that we'll get to at least two fulfillment centers pretty quickly in Europe. So I think it'll continue to be the most profitable channel, but we're also looking to make investments. Because when Eric came in, one of the first things he did was look at the return on investment of every dollar we spent. And obviously, given the kind of profitability, our ROI in the Direct-to-consumer business, it averages about two to three times better than any dollar we spend anywhere else in the company.

Having said that, based on the analysis that we've done and based on anecdotal information and my gut, I think it's pretty similar across all of our brands. Of course, the Direct business at Free People is much more important to the total Free People Retail segment than it is at Urban and Anthro because Free People has far fewer stores. But the way that customers toggle between a store one day, a website another day, a mobile experience the third day, is very, very consistent. And it's counterintuitive. Because like you, I would've thought that the Urban customer would've been the earliest adopter. But things are moving very, very quickly for the 30 to 45 group. I'm sure you know at Facebook, the fastest-growing component of Facebook users is that 35 to 45 or 30 to 45 year-old customer. Actually the fastest growing segment of online games is women aged 30 to 45. So it's pretty surprising how quickly this is all taking hold."

I think when we talk about the year that we've just finished, I've said repeatedly that the company did an amazing job at dividing and conquering. There was a group of us who looked at the budget, looked at the expenses in the business and did an amazing job with fiscal discipline and control. There was another group of us who said, how is it economic environment impacting what the customers going to want or experience and going to want to buy? And I think that's the improvement that you saw from quarter-to-quarter and the tremendous fourth quarter is really a result of the use of creativity to reconnect with the customer. So this is not -- the creative manifestation doesn't just happen with new brands. It happens with rebirth of each of our brands and quite friendly, almost everyday. We have many things in this organization. One is that the only thing that's constant is changed. Another thing, if you look in the rear view mirror more than once every seven seconds, you get into a car accident. Nothing is more boring than last year's best-seller. I mean we are an the organization who constantly moves forward and redefines ourselves. And we're true to Dick's vision from decades ago. But it's the Concept division. It's not the Execution division, that has to change. We drive our business with newness, not with price. So and just to build on what you said, there's so many fun things about working for this company but probably the most fun thing is working with the creative folks in this organization because they are absolute best of class. And if we kind of manage the creative process properly, they just drive tremendous value for the organization. And that's what we're seeing."

But if w",609,"Yes, Liz, we've talked about this publicly so I'll kind of reiterate what I've said. We have four key objectives. The first objective is continuing to drive four-wall productivity. And as I've said in the prepared remarks, it's pretty staggering. But if we can average the 7% comp for the next 10 years like we've averaged for the last 10 years, we'll drive $1,200,000,000 of incremental revenue to the top line. And you all listening to this call understands the profitability of that $1,200,000,000 of revenues. We have many strategies for doing that. The strategies revolving around getting the right product, in the right place at the right time and the right price. And that relates to sourcing strategies, planning and allocation strategies and so on. Our second kind of area with driving retail productivity relates to store design and site selection. Our third is store operations. And the fourth and probably the most impactful is the database that will allow us to manage our Retail business with a much higher level of optics than we have today. So that's number one. Number two is e-commerce. I don't want to limit, how big a business, how much of our business e-commerce can be. If you ask me five or eight years ago, if it could be more than 20% of the business, I probably would've said no. Last year, internally, we were saying it would be somewhere between 20% to 30% likely in all likelihood. Today, we're not going to be limit it to 30%. It could be more than 30%. We're just going to keep doing everything we can do to drive that business. We have internal goals that are very, very aggressive. International, as I said in my prepared comments, we have every indication based on the success of Urban Outfitters and the launch of Anthropologie that we can be as profitable as we need to be in Europe. Also based on the research we've done in the Far East, we think the same holds true for there. So we are going as quickly as we can in Europe. Andrew has done a great job laying the infrastructure, which we need to have in place before we put the pedal to the metal so to speak. But I think you'll see us start to open the stores more quickly. And you'll certainly see us ramp-up our e-commerce business very aggressively in Europe and other parts of the world. And then lastly, new brands. As I've said in the prepared comments, something that Dick and the board and I and the senior team here feel unbelievably passionate about is this idea that scarcity creates value. We never want anyone of our brands to become so big that they lose their specialness in the customer's minds. And as a result, we absolutely need additional brands to achieve our URBN objectives. So now with wedding, that's our sixth brands. As I said, I think we need a 10-year plan, we need 68 meaningful brands. I don't know, I don't want to -- I'll give a range on what meaningful means. I'd say not less than $500 million and probably more than $1 billion. And that's potential, not actual results in 10 years. So we're very, very committed to launching these brands that all share the URBN sensibility, DNA business approach and so on. So these four overall growth objectives are something that we've talked about continually. There's probably not a person, an employee in the organization who doesn't know about these. I blog about them. We have brown bag lunches about them. And people are very, very excited about them."

Glen mentioned trades turned up PLM system. They're probably now in the rollout phase. We have some domestic vendors on that. And in two weeks, we're traveling over to Asia to get of all of our own brand manufacturers on trade as well. That would give increased visibility on the logistics side. We expect to have all of our vendors on that by Q3 or Q4 or a great portion of that to get help in the whole weeks of supply. The customer cross channel database, as Glen mentioned, we'll get a cross channel view of the customer. We are on track to roll it out towards the end of the year. I'm hopeful that we'll get it out at the late part of Q3. I'm not sure if it will have a significance or any impact on Q4, would be doubtful. We are on track, rolling it out as well. Single SKU, a huge initiative to get single SKU between our retail and our direct channel. That is on track. We are hoping to get our first grand Leifsdottir up on single SKU in the second quarter followed by Free People, and then have all brands on single SKU by next year. What that gives us is the ability to better fulfill demand, to go out of stock in the store, to fulfill that demand from a different store or from the online channel. And conversely, if we have a demand online that we can order online, pick it up in the store or fulfill from a different fulfillment center. So again, huge capabilities.

And everyone who's listening to this call probably know much more about that than I do. So I don't think we're out of the woods. I think the difference between today and a year",388,"Yes, Roxanne, I think for, by and large, I don't think we've returned to 2007. And everyone who's listening to this call probably know much more about that than I do. So I don't think we're out of the woods. I think the difference between today and a year ago was that there's much more stability. I mean none of us knew what was going to happen a year ago. Those of us who have any kind of savings saw our savings accounts just go down by 50%. We had property. Many of us had real estate issues. We were under water. And I think that has quieted down a bit. So I think people have more of a sense of certainty. But I don't think that spending is going to return to 2007 levels. And I tend to think about things simply because I think it's easier to get things done when you simplify. I keep saying if a customer spent $100 on an average outing in 2007, she's spending $90 today. So we have to be 10% or 11% better than we were in 2007 to be flat. And I think we have to be 15% or 20% better to be comp positive. And that's how we think about it internally. We, as a company, we don't talk about weather. We don't talk about the economy. We have just a culture of constant growth. And we will grow or we will endeavor to grow however we need to. And we just had to be better. I think I spoke either on the last earnings call or the one before that about the customers more discriminating. She is. She has more off-price merchandise available to her. I think a lot of the off-price retailers have done a great job. She has more information available than ever, and she's using the Internet to make brick-and-mortar decisions now so she can shop price easily. We just have to be better. We have to offer better product and a better experience. And I think that's what we did, and I think that's why we had a good fourth quarter. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. I think we're going to be years before we get back to the confidence levels that we had in 2006, 2007."

And then Anthropologie was given birth by Free People. So Leifsdottir was given birth by Anthropologie. Terrain was given birth by Dick. We have a flurry of ideas in this organization all the time. And we talk about things all the time. And we listen to each other, and just quite frankly, there's just a lot of internal enthusiasm where there initially was a lot of internal enthusiasm around the idea of wedding. Now It just so happens that in, especially at Free People and Anthropologie, a lot of bridesmaids or people going to weddings shop those brands for wedding dresses, accessories and so on. And so not only do we hear about it internally, we also hear about it from our customers. So that was kind of stage one. Stage two is we begin to do due diligence. And most of you probably know something about the wedding industry, and I'm doing this from memory. So Wendy, is telling me yes or no if I get this wrong, but I think it's roughly about a $60 billion business. I think the average spend in North America on a wedding is about $45,000. I think the average bride spends about $4,500 all in, including her clothing. So that's the average. That's not the kind of customer that we reach. So we've done a lot of research. We've spoken to a lot of people about it. And like everything we do, we try to marry art and gut. We think this is going to be meaningful business. Anyone we talk to about this goes, wow, that sounds exciting. So we think it's going to be meaningful, but you know what the customers is going to tell us, that we're going to be very, very careful and methodical and conservative in how we launch it. And the customers are going to show us the way, just as she is with Terrain and Leifsdottir right now. But back to Barbara Wyckoff's question, we have a lot of ideas in this company. There are a lot of creative people. And there are a lot of kind of things that people have to say. And I'm sure you'll see more good ideas come out of this company."

So we made a lot of progress there. But what I can tell you is the people that I speak with who have international experience, Eric who just joined us, his predecessor company was 25% international. Most people I speak to are actually more profitable internationally than they are in North America. So that's not true for us. But we're very motivated by that knowledge, and we're working very hard to kind of uncover all the opportunities. As Eric said earlier, the next couple of years is absolutely going to be about investments. Let me remind everyone that virtually everything we do in Europe is done through third-party service providers. And that's typically more expensive and not as good as when you do it yourself. So we are very methodically bringing all of the things that we do in house in America, like logistics and systems, in-house in Europe over the next couple of years. So we'll be a phase of investment, but we believe we'll have good returns on those investments.  So again we've had a limit of technology challenges here, so we can't see who's still on the call.

Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and our Senior Team, including the majority of our brand and shared service leads.Earlier today, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and 12-month period ending January 31, 2010. I will begin today's call by reading prepared commentary regarding our performance, then the group and I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As usual, you will be able to access the text of today's conference call on our corporate website at www.urbanoutfittersinc.com.We are delighted to report a series of record-breaking results for the quarter and for the year. The following summarizes our fourth quarter fiscal 2010 performance versus the comparable quarter last year.Net sales increased 16% to $589 million, the largest quarterly revenue performance in our history. Income from operations grew 88% to a record $119 million, resulting in a best-ever fourth quarter operating margin of 20%. Net income increased 92% to a record $78 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Comparable Retail segment sales, which includes our Direct-To-Consumer channel, rose by 9%. Comparable store sales increased 4%. Comp sales at Urban Outfitters were flat, and comp sales at Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain rose by 10%, 11% and 23%, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales soared 28% despite a strategic 18% reduction in circulation with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale segment revenues declined 2% to $23 million. Gross profit margins increased 771 basis points, driven by significant gains in initial margins and reductions in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product.Comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarter's end. Selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales declined one basis point for the period despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $224 million to $745 million. I'll begin this morning by providing more detail on each of their key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales.New and non-comparable store sales contributed $40 million, including a gain of $3 million in currency translation adjustments for foreign base sales. The company opened eight new stores in the quarter, four each for Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, including one Urban Outfitters in Europe, bringing the total new stores opened for the year to 33.Within the quarter, comparable store sales were positive each month but strongest in December. By region, sales in Anthropologie were positive in all locations but strongest in the Northeast and South. In comparison, sales at Urban Outfitters are strongest in the Midwest and lagged on the West Coast. By store venue, sales in Anthropologie were uniform across all types, whereas sales at Urban Outfitters was strongest in mall locations.The company's comp store sales performance was driven by a 4% increase in transactions and a 4% increase in average unit selling price, which more than offset a 4% decrease in average unit per transaction. By brand, the number of transactions increased 8%, 25% and 2% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Average unit selling prices increased 14% at Anthropologie and decreased 8% and 2% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Finally, units per transaction were flat at Urban Outfitters and down 11% and 4% at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively.Direct-To-Consumer sales increased 28% to $112 million despite a strategic circulation decrease of 18%. The penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased nearly two percentage points to 19%, highlighting a secular shift in the way our customers shopping. The results was driven by more than $26 million website visits, a gain of 27% or $5.5 million additional visits.The Direct-To-Consumer channel was double digit positive across all brands, and our strategic investments in assortment, site experience, fulfillment and social media continue to yield high returns. Since the Direct-To-Consumer channel is becoming such a meaningful part of each brands revenue, effective next quarter, the company will begin to report comparable Retail segment sales by brand and will limit comparable retail store sales information to the total company's performance.By Merchandise category, Women's Apparel and Accessories led the pace in Anthropologie and Men's and Women's Apparel were strongest at Urban Outfitters. As we've communicated consistently throughout the year, they were powerful fashion cues in our business and our customers continue to discriminate by responding to newness, scarcity and great authentic design. Our comparable store inventories were 3% lower at quarters end. The brand presidents are very comfortable with our inventory position. And as I had mentioned before, they will continue to focus on achieving appropriate reductions in our inventory weeks-of-supply because we believe it positively impacts the customer experience and ultimately results in improvement to maintain margins.I'd like to now turn your attention to our Wholesale segment for the fourth quarter. With the addition of Leifsdottir, revenue declined by 2% to $23 million due primarily to a strategic reduction in clearance sales. Free People's wholesale revenue decreased by 5% to $21.9 million with sales to specialty stores increasing 7%, sales to department stores decreasing 2% and sales to clearance outlets decreasing 28%. The brand's average unit selling price increased 17% while unit sales declined 19%, driven primarily by the reduction in closeout sales. Leifsdottir's wholesale revenue increased 77% to $1.6 million, and we continue to gain confidence in the brand's long-term potential.I'd like to now turn your attention to gross margin operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter increased 771 basis points to 41.7%, driven largely by gains in initial margin and a reduction in markdowns to clear seasonal product. Let me reiterate that over the long term, we believe we have additional initial margin opportunity, an opportunity to reduce markdown levels to our historic average.The organization continued to exhibit exceptional discipline in managing expenses while simultaneously making strategic investment in design, the supply chain, technology, our Direct-To-Consumer businesses and our European infrastructure. Total selling, general and administrative costs for the quarter as a percentage of sales decreased by one basis point to 21.6% despite a significant accrual of additional incentive-based compensation expense related to our annual performance and earnings.The company generated an impressive 20% operating margin, earning a record $119 million of income from operations, an increase of 88% versus the same quarter last year. We also achieved our highest ever net income for a quarter, $78 million, an increase of 92% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.45. The company's annual effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% versus 35.6% for the prior year.The increase in the current year rate is primarily attributable to a lower proportion of tax-free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior year's holdings. The company estimates that next year's annual effective tax rate will be approximately 35.8%. The expected favorable change in next year's rate will be due in part to an increase in income generated from foreign operations.We've just completed the year that most of us will never forget. A year that was extraordinary in so many ways and a true test of our organization. I think it's fair to say that our company experienced the impact of the 2008 economic reset later than many of our peers. Given our exceptional fourth quarter results, I believe it's also accurate to say that we adjusted to the reset faster than many of our peers. Let me remind you that our business grew 22% in 2008, that we finished the year with an 8% comparable store sales gain and a 32% increase in our Direct-To-Consumer channel. It wasn't until the fourth quarter of 2008 that our performance decelerated to a 1% comp sales decline and 20% Direct-To-Consumer sales growth. We reached the nadir of this cycle the following quarter, the first quarter of 2009 with a 10% comp sales decline and Direct-To-Consumer growth of just 4%. The organization reacted swiftly to the unprecedented challenge. And as soon as the environment began to stabilize, they were able to read patterns in the business and respond accordingly.Driven by the team's effective efforts, the trend improved in each quarter throughout 2009, culminating in our record fourth quarter performance. I'm equally pleased to announce that our current February sales results exceeded our fourth quarter performance, which gives us confidence that our strategies have taken firm hold. These are the results of an exceptional organization, an organization characterized by passion, tenacity, intellect, agility, discipline, creativity and alignment. I believe these results also highlight the efficacy of our operating model and strategy. And for that, I offer the organization's appreciation to Dick and the Board. Before I close the call, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing our priorities for the year. We have four key initiatives, and I'll touch on each of them briefly. Our first focus is driving continuing gains in four wall productivity. If we can continue our historic 10-year average comp rate over the next decade, we'll drive an incremental $1.2 billion to the company's top line. Our strategies include making continued improvements in four key areas: Right product, right time, right place, right price, site selection and store design, store operations and marketing, including the launch of our cross-channel database.Our next priority is to continue to drive our E-Commerce business resulting in a higher penetration of Direct-To-Consumer sales to total company sales. We're unwilling to set a limit to the level of penetration and we're increasingly channel agnostic, as to how the customer reaches us. Our strategies for the year revolve around making iterative and disruptive changes to our online merchandise content, continuing to improve our websites, continuing to increase access to our brands through a Mobile technology, continuing to improve fulfillment operations and continuing to mind social media.Our third priority is international expansion. We have every indication that the company can achieve an appropriate level of profit and productivity in Europe. Urban Outfitters has made great strides over the last several years including a successful entry into Germany and a thriving launch of e-commerce. Anthropologie opened very successfully in London last fall, and it's about to open its second London location and launch its e-commerce site this month. And Free People will begin the course of European Wholesale expansion in the current year. Andrew McLean, the company's Chief Operating Officer for Europe is leading many of our European infrastructure and tactical improvement initiatives, including comprehensive market research and due diligence, the design and implementation of a logistics and fulfillment strategy, upgrades to our Retail and Direct-To-Consumer operating systems and so on.We have also begun to lay the groundwork for the company's expansion to the Far East. It is unlikely that we will have anything definitive to report in the near future, but we are targeting a calendar 2012 or 2013 launch.Our fourth and final priority is adding new brands to the Urban portfolio. We see our companies as a group of niche brands. And because we feel so strongly that scarcity creates value, we envision the company will be comprised of a minimum of six significant brands over the next 10 years. To that end, we are advancing our efforts with Leifsdottir. We launched the Leifsdottir website two weeks ago. We plan to launch shoes and handbags for shipment in the beginning of 2011. And we expect to open our first retail store in 2011.It's still too early in the brands development to talk about long-term potential, but the early signs continue to be extremely positive. We were also very pleased with the progress that Terrain made during the fourth quarter. I have said repeatedly that Terrain reminds me of Anthropologie in the early days. The customer loves it. And our enthusiasm for the experience is now generating significant increases in comp sales. Terrain team is confident that they can maintain the positive momentum. I am also pleased to announce that the company will be launching its next brand on Valentine's Day 2011. A wedding lifestyle concept that we hope will be as innovative as our existing brands. We plan to sell an event-based assortment of heirloom wedding gowns, bridesmaid and special occasion dresses, shoes, bags and accessories, intimate apparel, imitation, decor and gifts. We also expect to offer a community for brides before, during and after the wedding. The brand will initially launch with the website followed by a store opening later in the year. Of course, none of these initiatives happen without people. And I'd like to take a moment to announce three important promotions in the company.I couldn't be more pleased to recognize Barbara Rozsas who was just promoted to Chief Sourcing Officer, and Wendy Wurtzburger and Wendy McDevitt who were just been promoted to Co-President over the Anthropologie brand. Collectively, these three women have more than 40 years with our company, and they are each best of class at what they do. There is not a day that goes by when Barbara, Wendy and Wendy don't make our organization better, nor is there a day that goes by, when they don't teach me something or make me a better leader.The organization and I are profoundly grateful to their commitment, and it is a joy to publicly recognize their extraordinary contribution to our company. I firmly believe we are a better company today than we were a year ago, and I hope that I have conveyed the sense of optimism we are feeling. As we have often stated, the company's overarching goal is constant and simple, to grow revenue by at least 20%, to grow profit at a faster rate than sales, and to reach a minimum of 20% operating margin.And as always, the leadership team and I I'll look forward to continuing to inspire our customers and reward our shareholders and employees alike. I will now open the call to questions. And as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourself to one question. Thank you."

It's the strategy that we have around product, around the site itself, around fulfillment and around social media. And also around Mobile, so active [ph] to the site. So if I talk about each of those things briefly with product, we've made iterative changes to the assortments. And by that, I mean adding things like additional sizes or inseams, expanding assortment where we don't have the physical constraints of a brick-and-mortar store. We've also begun to make disruptive changes to the assortment. So by that, I mean things that we believe are appropriate for each of our customers in each of our brands, but things that we wouldn't normally carry on a store. So kind of a minor example of that might be swimsuit in Anthropologie. A more significant example of that might be the bicycles that Urban Outfitters offered this past season. So that's the product offer. Then you start to look at the websites themselves. Each of our brands have gone through multiple site redesigns over the last several years. As you know we launched ATG two years ago, which both are Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie run on. Free People runs on a different system. But what all the systems do is they allow the sites to be much more sticky, much more user-friendly, the checkout process is simpler. The analytics that we have to drive the business are more robust and so on. And I mentioned Mobile, all of our brands have some version of Mobile Access. Free People right now, I believe, probably is leading the way, but the other two brands will have Mobile sites that they're very happy with in the next several months. Social media, we've done a great job with. I think in North America alone, we've collected over 200,000 names on Facebook between our three brands. I was just looking at some data yesterday. We're really using the blogs effectively. Free People actually launched rating, reviews mix[ph] what I think maybe a year and a half ago. Urban followed suit, Anthropologie launched it in the middle of last year that's been tremendously effective. So we've gotten smarter and smarter about how to monetize all the opportunities around social media. And then lastly, fulfillment. We're very mindful of the fact that some of our e-tailer benchmarks have done a sensational job with the whole concept of the fabs and free [ph]. That's an area that we're testing. We'll be very methodical about it. But certainly, the kind of boundaries to direct response buying are shrinking in the last several years. And with all of those things, paper is just going away. I don't think it's going away overnight. But I think 10 years from now, it will probably be gone. And I think you're seeing that in the world of magazine publishing. You're seeing that in many, many other areas. So we're just trying to stay current. It's a very, very exciting time for us."

Markdowns are clearly higher from quarter-to-quarter just based on the seasonality of our business. As we look into fourth quarter comparisons, the improvement driven the 771 basis point improvement, it was really shared by markup and marked down almost equally with a slight advantage to markup. And we leveraged the occupancy with a positive comp as well. So looking forward, the company has made great strides in IMU improvement. But as you point, we do have opportunities in the markdown compared to our historical rates and, we'll continue to focus on that. And when it comes to the mix of business driven on the private side, I think we see slight improvement but not dramatic improvement going into fiscal '11."

The shows in Europe, everything looks terrific. And there's great trend in all of our businesses. And it goes back to what I said repeatedly, people are shopping their closets that they can shop their closets.

We do not benchmark ourselves against legacy brick-and-mortar retailers. We are benchmarking ourselves against e-tailers. And so when you look at an Amazon and this is off the top of my head, but since I think they're doing about $25 billion this year. They have clearly had better growth than we've had in the last decade. And we're not an Amazon, there are marketplace in a technology company. And we're a group of brands. But I'd certainly want to learn from Amazon. I want to learn from the off-price auction sites. I want to learn from Facebook. And we're really having a lot of conversations internally that talk about the fact that the e-commerce world is probably long term the best representation of who we are as a brand. Historically, if you think about this, we started as a brick-and-mortar retailer. We introduced Wholesale. It was only a dozen years ago that we introduced this catalog to the company, and we jokingly recall I think it was maybe eight, nine years ago when Michael Robinson, who now runs the Anthropologie direct in Europe, carried the HP computer on his back into his office to run the direct-to-consumer systems. So we're moving maybe not as quickly as Amazon. But relative to where we've come from, we think we're moving quickly. So the kinds of the improvements we're making are focused in the areas that I talked about. I think you'll see much more around product innovation on all of our sites and all of our brands. And I think you'll see us testing new categories that we believe our customer brand appropriate but that you wouldn't see in the stores. I think you'll see a lot of interesting things happen in our websites. We don't have a lot of video, for example, right now. And I'm sure you've all read the impact that video has on conversion. I think you'll see us do a lot more with social media. I think you'll see us texting this whole concept of past and pre. The Merkle database, which I'm sure someone's going to ask me about, I think we'll have a profound impact on our Direct-to-consumer business. And the other thing we're not really -- I've talked about on earlier calls is how our e-commerce in websites can synergistically impact our brick-and-mortar Retail business. Remember, the only way we have to talk to our Retail of customers, which is still north of 80% of our business right now is through catalogs and kind of general e-mails, but they're not targeted. So when we have Merkle up and running, which will happened at the end of the year, we'll be able to understand exactly what impact we get out of every e-mail that we send or every Facebook that we manage. So I hope that gives you some clarity. With regard to the SG&A, I'll wait for someone else to answer the question."

We managed the weeks to supply, not to absolute inventory levels. So right now, the total comp inventories were down 3%. They were down most at the Urban brand and least at the Anthropologie brand, kind of following the comps. But as I've said in my prepared comments, each of the brand presidents feel very, very comfortable with where the inventories are. Over the long term, meaning over the next three to five years, I'd like to see a continued reduction in weeks of supply as we get up and running with our trade stone, software systems, as we continue to make improvements in our planning and allocation systems. And the reason why we all feel so strongly about that is because we think it will, as I said in my prepared comments, improve the customer experience, the less the store has to handle the product, the more time they can spend with the customer, the crisper and cleaner and fresher the product is and so on. And of course the benefit of that is improved merchandise margins. So we've had a lot of help from the sourcing group over the last couple of years, reducing our weeks of supply. And that's really what you're seeing in the numbers. And I think we'll continue to see improvements there."

I think that I know we've talked about that in general terms, the differences between the four walls, brick-and-mortar profitability and the Wholesale profitability and the direct profitability. And we are absolutely most profitable in the Direct business. So it's a nice thing that we continue to gain penetration. Having said that, we are making a lot of investments in the direct area as we developed our plans for the current year. We didn't plan to deleverage in many areas but one of the areas that we did plan to deleverage slightly is in the IT area. Calvin is sitting to my right. And I know I'm sure someone's going to ask some of the IT initiatives at some point. But Calvin's got a lot on his plate, much of which will impact the Direct business. We also remember North America, we have only one fulfillment center. We're looking to add a second fulfillment center this year. We're also looking to go from third-party fulfillment to in-house fulfillment in Europe. I think it's likely that we'll get to at least two fulfillment centers pretty quickly in Europe. So I think it'll continue to be the most profitable channel, but we're also looking to make investments. Because when Eric came in, one of the first things he did was look at the return on investment of every dollar we spent. And obviously, given the kind of profitability, our ROI in the Direct-to-consumer business, it averages about two to three times better than any dollar we spend anywhere else in the company. So we're going to be spending money there."

Having said that, based on the analysis that we've done and based on anecdotal information and my gut, I think it's pretty similar across all of our brands. Of course, the Direct business at Free People is much more important to the total Free People Retail segment than it is at Urban and Anthro because Free People has far fewer stores. But the way that customers toggle between a store one day, a website another day, a mobile experience the third day, is very, very consistent. And it's counterintuitive. Because like you, I would've thought that the Urban customer would've been the earliest adopter. But things are moving very, very quickly for the 30 to 45 group. I'm sure you know at Facebook, the fastest-growing component of Facebook users is that 35 to 45 or 30 to 45 year-old customer. Actually the fastest growing segment of online games is women aged 30 to 45. So it's pretty surprising how quickly this is all taking hold."

I think when we talk about the year that we've just finished, I've said repeatedly that the company did an amazing job at dividing and conquering.

There was another group of us who said, how is it economic environment impacting what the customers going to want or experience and going to want to buy? And I think that's the improvement that you saw from quarter-to-quarter and the tremendous fourth quarter is really a result of the use of creativity to reconnect with the customer. So this is not -- the creative manifestation doesn't just happen with new brands. It happens with rebirth of each of our brands and quite friendly, almost everyday. We have many things in this organization. One is that the only thing that's constant is changed. Another thing, if you look in the rear view mirror more than once every seven seconds, you get into a car accident. Nothing is more boring than last year's best-seller. I mean we are an the organization who constantly moves forward and redefines ourselves. And we're true to Dick's vision from decades ago. But it's the Concept division. It's not the Execution division, that has to change. We drive our business with newness, not with price. So and just to build on what you said, there's so many fun things about working for this company but probably the most fun thing is working with the creative folks in this organization because they are absolute best of class. And if we kind of manage the creative process properly, they just drive tremendous value for the organization. And that's what we're seeing."

And as I've said in the prepared remarks, it's pretty staggering. But if we can average the 7% comp for the next 10 years like we've averaged for the last 10 years, we'll drive $1,200,000,000 of incremental revenue to the top line. And you all listening to this call understands the profitability of that $1,200,000,000 of revenues. We have many strategies for doing that. The strategies revolving around getting the right product, in the right place at the right time and the right price. And that relates to sourcing strategies, planning and allocation strategies and so on. Our second kind of area with driving retail productivity relates to store design and site selection. Our third is store operations. And the fourth and probably the most impactful is the database that will allow us to manage our Retail business with a much higher level of optics than we have today. So that's number one. Number two is e-commerce. I don't want to limit, how big a business, how much of our business e-commerce can be. If you ask me five or eight years ago, if it could be more than 20% of the business, I probably would've said no. Last year, internally, we were saying it would be somewhere between 20% to 30% likely in all likelihood. Today, we're not going to be limit it to 30%. It could be more than 30%. We're just going to keep doing everything we can do to drive that business. We have internal goals that are very, very aggressive. International, as I said in my prepared comments, we have every indication based on the success of Urban Outfitters and the launch of Anthropologie that we can be as profitable as we need to be in Europe. Also based on the research we've done in the Far East, we think the same holds true for there. So we are going as quickly as we can in Europe. Andrew has done a great job laying the infrastructure, which we need to have in place before we put the pedal to the metal so to speak. But I think you'll see us start to open the stores more quickly. And you'll certainly see us ramp-up our e-commerce business very aggressively in Europe and other parts of the world. And then lastly, new brands. As I've said in the prepared comments, something that Dick and the board and I and the senior team here feel unbelievably passionate about is this idea that scarcity creates value. We never want anyone of our brands to become so big that they lose their specialness in the customer's minds. And as a result, we absolutely need additional brands to achieve our URBN objectives. So now with wedding, that's our sixth brands. As I said, I think we need a 10-year plan, we need 68 meaningful brands. I don't know, I don't want to -- I'll give a range on what meaningful means. I'd say not less than $500 million and probably more than $1 billion. And that's potential, not actual results in 10 years. So we're very, very committed to launching these brands that all share the URBN sensibility, DNA business approach and so on. So these four overall growth objectives are something that we've talked about continually. There's probably not a person, an employee in the organization who doesn't know about these. I blog about them. We have brown bag lunches about them. And people are very, very excited about them."

We are hoping to get our first grand Leifsdottir up on single SKU in the second quarter followed by Free People, and then have all brands on single SKU by next year. What that gives us is the ability to better fulfill demand, to go out of stock in the store, to fulfill that demand from a different store or from the online channel. And conversely, if we have a demand online that we can order online, pick it up in the store or fulfill from a different fulfillment center. So again, huge capabilities.

With regard to Free People, I don't want to give too much detail. I think that the productivity of the Free People stores is great. Like our other brands, we had great stores and not so great stores. There is absolutely no relationship between our Wholesale distribution and our retail performance. If anything, I'd say there's a positive relationship, and that's probably what other people talk about, I'd expect.

What we do, the customers love. But we're really not able to do a lot, which is why we're so anxious to get our cross channel database up and running, which Calvin continues to assure me will be sometime in the third quarter, end of third quarter of this year. So we're just a few months away. I think once we have it, we'll be able to view the kind of things that we always envision doing. And let me remind everyone, it's not a loyalty program. The way we think about it in all of our brands is the more we know about our customers, the more we can do for our customers. Personalization is one of the biggest trends in technology right now. And what this database will allow us to do is personalize the experience, the offer, the communication on a customer-by-customer basis.

And reporting into Freeman is Real Estate, Technology and Talent. And John is handling all Investor Relations. Glen Bodzy has been our Counsel, and as Counsel has been with us for over a decade and does a superb job. Underneath Freeman, we have Calvin Hollinger handling all Technology, David Ziel handling all Development, Bill Cody handling Talent. All three of them do an absolutely exceptional job. In the brands, we have Andrew McLean, obviously in Europe. In the brands, I just announced that we promoted Wendy [Wendy Brown] and Wendy [Wendy Wurtzburger] to be co-president of Anthropologie. We also have James Bidwell as Managing Director of Anthropologie Europe. For Urban Outfitters, obviously we have Ted. Reporting to Ted, we have Hugh Wallace [ph] who runs Urban Europe.

But we are planning on filling Jim's job, and I expect we'll have an announcement on that in the near future.

And everyone who's listening to this call probably know much more about that than I do. So I don't think we're out of the woods. I think the difference between today and a year ago was that there's much more stability. I mean none of us knew what was going to happen a year ago. Those of us who have any kind of savings saw our savings accounts just go down by 50%. We had property. Many of us had real estate issues. We were under water. And I think that has quieted down a bit. So I think people have more of a sense of certainty. But I don't think that spending is going to return to 2007 levels. And I tend to think about things simply because I think it's easier to get things done when you simplify. I keep saying if a customer spent $100 on an average outing in 2007, she's spending $90 today. So we have to be 10% or 11% better than we were in 2007 to be flat. And I think we have to be 15% or 20% better to be comp positive. And that's how we think about it internally. We, as a company, we don't talk about weather. We don't talk about the economy. We have just a culture of constant growth. And we will grow or we will endeavor to grow however we need to. And we just had to be better. I think I spoke either on the last earnings call or the one before that about the customers more discriminating. She is. She has more off-price merchandise available to her. I think a lot of the off-price retailers have done a great job. She has more information available than ever, and she's using the Internet to make brick-and-mortar decisions now so she can shop price easily. We just have to be better. We have to offer better product and a better experience. And I think that's what we did, and I think that's why we had a good fourth quarter. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. I think we're going to be years before we get back to the confidence levels that we had in 2006, 2007."

And then Anthropologie was given birth by Free People. So Leifsdottir was given birth by Anthropologie. Terrain was given birth by Dick. We have a flurry of ideas in this organization all the time. And we talk about things all the time. And we listen to each other, and just quite frankly, there's just a lot of internal enthusiasm where there initially was a lot of internal enthusiasm around the idea of wedding. Now It just so happens that in, especially at Free People and Anthropologie, a lot of bridesmaids or people going to weddings shop those brands for wedding dresses, accessories and so on. And so not only do we hear about it internally, we also hear about it from our customers. So that was kind of stage one. Stage two is we begin to do due diligence. And most of you probably know something about the wedding industry, and I'm doing this from memory. So Wendy, is telling me yes or no if I get this wrong, but I think it's roughly about a $60 billion business. I think the average spend in North America on a wedding is about $45,000. I think the average bride spends about $4,500 all in, including her clothing. So that's the average. That's not the kind of customer that we reach. So we've done a lot of research. We've spoken to a lot of people about it. And like everything we do, we try to marry art and gut. We think this is going to be meaningful business. Anyone we talk to about this goes, wow, that sounds exciting. So we think it's going to be meaningful, but you know what the customers is going to tell us, that we're going to be very, very careful and methodical and conservative in how we launch it. And the customers are going to show us the way, just as she is with Terrain and Leifsdottir right now. But back to Barbara Wyckoff's question, we have a lot of ideas in this company. There are a lot of creative people. And there are a lot of kind of things that people have to say. And I'm sure you'll see more good ideas come out of this company."

All I can say at this point, I know what we've experienced internally, and I speak to a lot of people who have international businesses, internally, we're not on par yet. Although Hugh has made a lot of improvement in the last couple of years. And the Anthropologie business started at a profit, literally four-wall profit, the first month it opened. So we made a lot of progress there. But what I can tell you is the people that I speak with who have international experience, Eric who just joined us, his predecessor company was 25% international. Most people I speak to are actually more profitable internationally than they are in North America. So that's not true for us. But we're very motivated by that knowledge, and we're working very hard to kind of uncover all the opportunities. As Eric said earlier, the next couple of years is absolutely going to be about investments. Let me remind everyone that virtually everything we do in Europe is done through third-party service providers. And that's typically more expensive and not as good as when you do it yourself. So we are very methodically bringing all of the things that we do in house in America, like logistics and systems, in-house in Europe over the next couple of years. So we'll be a phase of investment, but we believe we'll have good returns on those investments.  So again we've had a limit of technology challenges here, so we can't see who's still on the call. But I just want to thank everyone for being with us, great questions today. And as always, thanks for your support we look forward to seeing you all. Have a great day."

Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and the majority of our brand and Shared Service leaders.
Earlier this morning, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three-month period ending April 30, 2010. I will begin today's call by reading prepared commentary regarding our performance, then the group and I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As usual, you will be able to access the text of today's conference call on our corporate Web site at www.urbanoutfittersinc.com.
We are delighted to begin the new fiscal year with a series of record-breaking results for the quarter. The following summarizes our first quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year.
Net sales increased 25% to $480 million. Income from operations grew 78% to $82 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. Net income increased 72% to $53 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Comparable retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, rose 16% with increases of 22%, 25%, 22% and 9% at Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 11%. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 42% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenue increased 4% to $25 million. 
Gross profit margins increased 459 basis points, aided by significant gains in initial margins, reductions in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product and a lower rate of occupancy expense driven by the strong store comparable net sales growth.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of sales, declined 55 basis points to 24.7%. Comparable retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 3% higher at quarter's end. 
Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-to-year by $213 million to $773 million, increasing $28 million to the January 31, 2010 balance. 
I'll begin today by providing more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $34 million, including a gain of $3 million in currency translation adjustments for foreign-based sales. The company opened nine new stores in the quarter: five Anthropologie stores, including a second location in London; two Free People stores; and two Urban Outfitters stores. Within the quarter, comparable store sales were positive each month but strongest in March, although on a two-year basis, they were strongest in April. By region, sales in Anthropologie were positive in all locations but strongest in the West. And sales at Urban Outfitters were positive in all locations but strongest in the South.
By store venue, sales at Anthropologie was strongest in lifestyle centers and sales at Urban Outfitters were strongest in malls. For stores, transaction counts were up 10%. Average unit selling prices declined by 1% and units per transaction increased by 2%. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 42% to $86 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 18%, highlighting a continuing secular shift in the way our customer is shopping and the efficacy of our e-commerce strategies. These results were driven by more than 24 million Web site visits, a gain of 30% or nearly 6 million visits. 
By merchandise category, Women's Apparel and Accessories were strongest in Anthropologie, and Women's Apparel and Accessories and Men's Apparel were strongest at Urban Outfitters. Each brand's merchant team including planning, design, production and buying, transitioned from winter to spring to summer exceptionally well. As we entered the second quarter, the inventory content was fresh, compelling and appropriately balanced.
I'd like to now turn your attention to our Wholesale segment for the quarter. With the addition of Leifsdottir, revenue increased 4% to $25 million. While Free People's Wholesale revenue increased just 1% to $23 million, the composition of the business was favorable with sales to specialty stores increasing 31%, sales to department stores flat and sales to clearance outlets decreasing significantly. Leifsdottir's Wholesale revenue increased 37% to $2.5 million, and we are continually encouraged by the brand's long-term potential.
I'd like to now turn your attention to gross margin, operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter increased 459 basis points to 41.8%, driven by gains in initial margins, reduction in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product and a lower rate of occupancy expense. I'd like to reiterate that over the long term, we believe we have continued opportunity to increase initial margins and reduce markdown levels.
The organization continued to exhibit exceptional discipline in managing expenses while making strategic investments in talent, design, supply chain, technology, our Direct-to-consumer businesses and our European infrastructure. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, declined 55 basis points to 24.7%. This improvement was driven by the control and leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable expenses, which more than offset an increased accrual of incentive-based compensation expense based on our current year performance.
The company generated an impressive 17% operating margin, earning a first quarter record of $82 million in income from operations, an increase of 78% versus the same quarter last year. We also achieved our highest-ever net income for a first quarter, $53 million, an increase of 72% from the prior year, with earnings per diluted share of $0.31. 
The company's annual effective tax rate was 35.9% versus 36.1% for the same quarter last year, and the company anticipates further improvement from the current quarter annual effective tax rate for the remainder of the year related to an increase in income generated from foreign operations.
It's satisfying to begin the new fiscal year with record sales and earnings but to do so within the greater context of our long-term goals is even more gratifying. As I think of the four key growth initiatives we laid out a year ago, our organization executed admirably. Our first key initiative was to drive productivity in our core brick-and-mortar businesses through employing a variety of strategies in four areas: product, site selection and store design, store operations and marketing. The team has made numerous process and systemic improvements across all four functions. In fact, I would say that our first quarter 11% comparable store performance, our first quarter positive year-on-year performance and our 10-year comparable store average of 6% isn't just about fashion. It's about strategy and execution. The way we manage the supply chain has changed dramatically, beginning with assortment architecture and design, flowing through to production buying and logistics and finishing with allocation. We're a different, more controlled, more nimble company and the exciting thing is that we still have a lot of opportunity ahead.
The improvements we've made in site selection and store design are also beginning to pay off. Our class of 2009 was one of our best performing groups of new stores ever. In fact, for the company as a whole, in the first quarter, our new stores had slightly higher sales per square foot averages than our comparable stores. 
We're on track with the implementation of our cross-channel database. We plan to be fully operational by the end of the third quarter, and we expect to see modest benefits in the fourth quarter. Just imagine the potential. Once we know who's shopping, what motivates them to shop, how and when they want us to communicate, how they want us to personalize their shopping experience, we expect to mine this information to better serve our customers and ultimately drive productivity for years to come.
Our second key initiative was to increase the penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to total company sales by focusing on five strategic areas: our online merchandise assortment, the Web sites themselves, mobile commerce, fulfillment operations and social media. I have said before that we are channel-agnostic as to how our customer reaches us and that we are unwilling to set an upwards limit to the level of penetration. Our mind shift is that we see our online experience as a robust expression of who we are as a brand, unbound by brick-and-mortar constraints. We believe, however, that for our customers and for the lifestyle experience and types of profitability products we sell, that we are in a position of strength as a multi-channel retailer. We believe our 42% gain in Direct-to-consumer sales indicates that our strategies are working. And I'd like to offer my congratulations and thanks to the myriad of people on the URBN team who have worked so hard to make this happen.
The third key initiative we discussed was international expansion, currently with an emphasis in Europe but eventually moving to the Far East and other parts of the world. The mind shift here is that we no longer view ourselves as a North American retailer. Instead, we view ourselves as a global retailer, and we are in the process of creating a strategy, structure and approach to support that goal. 
In the meantime, our European business is becoming increasingly important to the company. The Urban brand continues to narrow the performance gap between North America and Europe. And during this past first quarter, Anthropologie successfully opened its second London location and launched anthropologie.eu. 
Our final growth initiative was adding brands to the URBN portfolio so that the company is comprised of a minimum of six significant brands over the next 10 years. During the first quarter, we continued to make important progress with Terrain and Leifsdottir, and we also announced the formation of our new wedding concept, which will launch during the first quarter of calendar 2011.
Before I finish with my prepared comments this morning, I'd like to formally recognize and thank John Kyees and Ted Marlow for their exceptional contributions to our company. John has been an invaluable partner to me and the executive leadership team during his nearly seven-year tenure with the company. During John's reign, our company revenue grew from $548 million to just under $2 billion. Our yearly profit grew from $48 million to $220 million, and our market cap grew from $404 million to $5.3 billion. We will miss John's stewardship and we will also miss his kindness and decency.
Ted has been an estimable member of the Urban leadership team as well. Under Ted's nine-year watch, the Urban Outfitters brand revenue nearly sextupled to more than $900 million. He opened more than 100 new stores. He launched the Direct-to-consumer business and the European business thrived. Ted is a powerful leader, leaving behind a strong global team and creative vision and foundation that will carry the brand for years to come. Personally, and on behalf of the board and all URBN employees, we thank John and Ted for their extraordinary commitment and wish them all the best in retirement.
We welcomed Eric Artz to the company on our last call so it's now time to welcome Steve Murray. As most of you have read, Steve joined our company from the VF Corporation where he served as President of the VF Action Sports Coalition overseeing the Vans and Reef brands. Steve is a marketer and merchant at heart and brings a vast global experience and brilliant track record in growing lifestyle brands and retail concepts. We are thrilled to have Steve join our executive team and we are confident that he will continue to build the Urban Outfitters' legacy and business. 
As we have often repeated, our overarching goal is constant and simple: to grow revenue by at least 20%, to grow profit at a faster rate than sales and to reach a minimum of 20% operating income. With a 10-year revenue CAGR of 21% and a 10-year income from operations CAGR of 25%, we are on course. Furthermore, I believe we are a better company than ever with sound strategies, a world-class organization and an unerring focus on superior execution. As always, the leadership team and I look forward to continuing to inspire our customers and reward our shareholders and employees alike. 
I will now open the call to questions, and as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourselves to one question. Thank you."

And the reason why we do that is because we believe our customer appreciates complexity. And I know that that's a different model than many of our peers and I don't think it's better or worse. It's just different. It's who we are as a company. This company has never been about a single person. It was never about Dick and it's certainly not about me. It's about the group of leaders and the organization. We are an organization that spends a lot of time on choosing who we bring into the company. Once we bring people into the company, we spend a lot of time on strategy and clarity of expectations. We have terrific information systems that allow us to understand whether or not our daily, weekly, monthly, yearly decisions are working or not working. There's a high level of accountability but we do push decisions down on the company. I remember saying when I first became CEO that I no longer viewed myself as a merchant, that I viewed myself as a strategist and a manager. And each of the brands are run by merchants, and they are the people who are calling the merchandise decisions. And I think that long-term, that's the way we can manage the level of complexity we have in the business. So I am not sitting in product reviews on a brand-by-brand basis like some of my peers do. That's just not the way I envision my role. I envision my role as a mentor, as helping people with strategy, as being someone to bounce ideas off and so on. And quite frankly, if I use the two Wendys who have very successfully run Anthropologie for the last three years, they've done a better job with Anthropologie than I did. And that's to their credit and I'm sure they would credit the staff below them. And that's just the way our company works."

Now the leverage is somewhat muted by the investment that we also have spoken about here, investments in our Europe infrastructure, the Anthropologie new store, the e-com launch of Anthropologie, our overall technology investments and continued investments in Direct and people. So when you add all those up or to give you a sense of magnitude of those items that I just mentioned, it equates to about a third of the 22% increase. I'd also comment that as we look forward through the balance of the year, that many of those comparisons become more favorable, specifically the incentive compensation piece. So just to reconfirm, we're definitely rushing to assure that we have the infrastructure in place to achieve our growth plans, but we're not rushing to achieve our 20% operating target."

And I also -- I want to reiterate what Eric said: I think all of us sitting around this table are highly confident that we will achieve our 20%-plus ROS profit goal. But we're also very, very cognizant of investing in our business because we all want to be here 5 and 10 and 15 years from now and we want our business to resonate with the customers even more 10 and 15 years from now than it does today. So we are putting investment, not only in areas such as IT, logistics, infrastructure and people, but we're also putting investments in product, quite frankly. So we absolutely have a plan to continue to raise IMU and lower markdowns, but we're going to do so in a very methodical way because in this economy today, we are still fighting for every dollar. I've said repeatedly, we're not back in 2007. It's still tough out there. The customer expects more and more value, more surprises and delights, and we are winning right now because our product is better. And that comes at a price. So with regard to the markdown rate, I don't know how low, low can be. I think that we've made such progress in calendar compression, such progress in the way we plan, such progress in the way we allocate, but when I look at what's on board from a systems point of view, all of the upcoming enablers, I don't know how low, low can be. I've got to think that we'll be able to make very, very good improvement, but I really -- so the message is what Eric said: We're going to work as hard as we can to grow profit faster than sales. I think we're all confident about the 20% but I don't want to give you any more insight other than that."

The first strategy is to continue to do a better job with right product, right place, right time, right price. And I could talk about that for an hour. The way we'll continue to make improvements there are in a better planning system, in continuing to compress the calendars so that we can make decisions at the last possible moment and get the inventory as correct as possible so that we can allocate more effectively. When you think about the stores that we have, not only in North America but around the world, we cover a variety of weather zones, fashion types. We have different kinds of price elasticities, depending upon where we trade, and the more we can micro allocate, the more productive we can make each of our stores. So there's a lot of opportunities still in the way that we plan our merchandise, buy it, design it and allocate it. And price it quite frankly. Number two is our site selection. Now I was really pleased to review the results and see that our new store group was more productive than our comparable store group this past quarter because it means we're doing a better job picking sites. We're using empirical data, objective data now, and we're also being smarter about the way we design our stores. So that's important. Next, the way we operate our stores. And those of you who know anything about store operations know that a great store manager can probably impact a comp number by as much as 25% or more, and we're working as a company to understand to kind of institutionalize what it is that a great store manager does to make sure that we do that across all of our stores. The way one manages a $15 million store is different than the way one manages a $10 million store or a $5 million store, and we're working harder to understand what those differences are and make sure we are appropriately distortive. And last, and certainly not least, is this database, this multi-channel database. Let me remind everyone that right now, we do not know who shops at our stores. We don't know -- when we communicate to people [indiscernible] we have a vague sense are shopping our stores, we don't know if that communication works or doesn't work. We don't know how often our customers come in, what they buy with what and so on. So it's like flying blind. And when our database is up and running, which we expect to be towards the end of the third quarter, we will begin to collect this information, and over time, we will have robust information. And really the reason for us having this information is that the more we can know about our customers, the better job we can do servicing them. So it's not about shoving additional product down their throats. It's really about doing a better job, understanding their wants and needs, their timing, how they want to be committed with and so on. And because we haven't done this, we don't know what it's going to be worth. My hunch, my intuition tells me it's going to be worth quite a bit. In terms of the targets that we have, we have quite a bit of variation within our existing store base. So we have stores, if I look at Anthropologie, which on a net basis, trades at slightly over $800 a foot, we have many stores that trade in excess of $2,000 a foot. So I really, much like the Direct penetration, I don't want to put a limit on it. Our internal goal is to try to take the last 10-year comp average, which is six, and to try to replicate it over the next 10 years. And so if you just take $800 a foot and multiply it times six, 10 years out, you'll get to a number. I hope we can hit that. We certainly have a lot of work on our plate to continue to drive comps."

Make no mistake, last year was a buyer's market and I think at the supply level, we lost a lot of supply last year because the demand came down and all of the sudden, there's a feeding frenzy in people need product. So the balance of supply and demand has shifted and when that happens, prices go up. Now having said that, we have a terrific organization both here and overseas and we have terrific partners in our factories. And they understand what it is we need to be successful and they're supportive of us. So I do think we'll see -- I think we'll experience pressure. I don't think the pressure that we expect to experience will be quite what some other people experienced. Remember, a lot of our product has so much more layer and detail to it that it's not quite as dependent on the commodity pricing as some other more basic retailers would be. And I think that our problem and just like bad weather or good weather or bad economy or good economy, that's our problem and we have to be smart about it.

What enables us is to be able to serve the customer demand multi-channel, cross-channel, that's the big investment. We continue to invest in sourcing production logistics initiatives. As we mentioned, we are in process of rolling out TradeStone. We have a couple of hundred vendors on TradeStone which represent about 90% of our own brand; vendors we think some efficiencies on purchase order side. We plan to roll this out to all vendors towards the end of this year to get more visibility of the merchandise coming in. We're investing heavily in our logistic infrastructure with more automation and to our distribution centers to make sure we can fulfill both our retail and our e-commerce customers more effectively.

When I look at the budget that we prepared over the last few years and I look at the results that have come out of those budgets, I'm very, very proud of the work that the organization has done because I feel that we've spent money wisely. And I mean, we're sitting on three cash machines: Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People, and I think from a business point of view, it's very prudent to continue to invest in those businesses. They all have a lot of runway. They're all very profitable and they're all investments that we can make in those three businesses to continue to drive them. I've said in the prepared remarks that we no longer define ourselves as a North American retailer. We define ourselves as a global retailer and I think that we have a lot of work to do in that area. I used to, in my own mind, think that international sales could be 5%, 10%, 15% 20%, 25% of our business. Who the heck knows? We may find out over time that it could be 50% or more of our business.

I'm looking at Barbara Rozsas across the table from me and I think we have something like 165 calendars in the company -- close to a 165 calendars in the company and what that means is that virtually every product category and every brand has at least one of its own category. And some of the product categories, the bigger ones have multiple calendars. So it's a very, very complex answer. What I would say to you is we have taken weeks off of the calendar in total, and if we are properly positioned on fabric, in the right kind of product, I have seen our group be able to move products within two to three weeks. And that’s an if. We need to own the fabric, the factory needs to be on board that we're going to place a follow-up order with them, but we were never able to do that a few years ago. What I can tell you is that we are much, much more liquid, 90 days and beyond than we have ever been. I mean, I look at our open-to-buys every week but I always look at them the morning of an earnings call or the night before an earnings call, and I'm increasingly struck and impressed by how liquid we are in the following quarter. So not the quarter that we're in but the quarter beyond that and the quarters beyond that. We have much more flexibility than we ever had. I think, Barbara, average we've cut six to eight weeks off the calendar?"

And that's the kind of product that we might get in two to three weeks. What Barbara's talking about is we don't want to put the entire company on two to three weeks. That would be lunatic. So it's a very, very layered approach. But kudos to Barbara, to the merchant team, to the designers and to our factories overseas because they've all worked together as a team to make dramatic improvements here, and everybody understands that it's mutually good for everybody if it's right for the customer."

And he has done a lot of wonderful research work in terms of helping us understand size of markets, logistical and legal complexities, ability to make money in market and so on. And as I said in prior earnings calls, 70% of -- the size of the business in Europe is actually about 10% larger than the size of the business in North America. 70% of that opportunity is in five markets: the U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Germany. And I think we have an opportunity to be strategic about that 70%. What we're doing, Richard, is really doing a very thorough due diligence in each market. I think we'll have kind of a market-by-market approach as opposed to the opportunistic approach, which has probably characterized our first 10 or 12 years in Europe. Your question about using the Direct-to-consumer as a guide, absolutely. Calvin will have Merkle. We’ll have the database in Europe in about 18 months. So I think once we have the database there. Also in terms of the single SKU that Calvin talked about, once we have the single SKU in Europe, so we share a product SKU between North America and Europe, we'll be able to do an even better job with that. But I think we will use analytic tools for real estate in Europe just like we use here. We'll use the Direct-to-customer database like we use here and we’ll use research like we use here. And I think that we have moved slower in Europe, Richard, than we've moved in North America, but we have enough signs in the business in both of our brands to be pretty confident moving forward. We are also starting to shift Free People. We opened up Cortez. We have plans to open up several other accounts in Europe and so all three brands will be in Europe. With regards to the Far East and other parts of the world, we'll approach it the same way we did with Europe. We're in the process now of due diligence. We're looking at real estate, speaking with potential leaders. We'll likely go with one brand first but I think we would follow with a second brand pretty quickly."

The first one is what's the difference between geographic regions both within North America and the world at large? And as Steve said and Ted has certainly spoken to this earlier, there is a good bit of difference between the assortment in Urban Europe and Urban North America. Having said that, the two geographies performed relatively evenly. Within Anthropologie, there's a large amount of overlap between Europe and America and those two businesses also performed evenly. In terms of the geographic differences, I question whether or not we should even report them because I think that they're kind of irrelevant. It leads one way in Urban, one quarter another way in other Anthropologie one quarter and generally speaking, the differences aren't that significant. If there's extreme weather in the country, sometimes it’ll impact that. If there's extreme geographic economic issues, it may highlight that.

And they've have done a good job with that. And internationally, much like what I've said with Stacy, the business is pretty consistent, internationally versus domestically. So we feel very comfortable with where our Home business is right now."

Joining me today is Eric Artz, Chief Financial Officer; John Kyees, Chief Investor Relations Officer; and the majority of our brand and Shared Service leaders.
Earlier this morning, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three-month period ending April 30, 2010. I will begin today's call by reading prepared commentary regarding our performance, then the group and I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As usual, you will be able to access the text of today's conference call on our corporate website at www.urbanoutfittersinc.com.
We are delighted to begin the new fiscal year with a series of record-breaking results for the quarter. The following summarizes our first quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year.
Net sales increased 25% to $480 million. Income from operations grew 78% to $82 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. Net income increased 72% to $53 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Comparable retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, rose 16% with increases of 22%, 25%, 22% and 9% at Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 11%. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 42% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenue increased 4% to $25 million. 
Gross profit margins increased 459 basis points, aided by significant gains in initial margins, reductions in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product and a lower rate of occupancy expense driven by the strong store comparable net sales growth.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of sales, declined 55 basis points to 24.7%. Comparable retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 3% higher at quarter's end. 
Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-to-year by $213 million to $773 million, increasing $28 million to the January 31, 2010 balance. 
I'll begin today by providing more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $34 million, including a gain of $3 million in currency translation adjustments for foreign-based sales. The company opened nine new stores in the quarter: five Anthropologie stores, including a second location in London; two Free People stores; and two Urban Outfitters stores. Within the quarter, comparable store sales were positive each month but strongest in March, although on a two-year basis, they were strongest in April. By region, sales in Anthropologie were positive in all locations but strongest in the West. And sales at Urban Outfitters were positive in all locations but strongest in the South.
By store venue, sales at Anthropologie was strongest in lifestyle centers and sales at Urban Outfitters were strongest in malls. For stores, transaction counts were up 10%. Average unit selling prices declined by 1% and units per transaction increased by 2%. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 42% to $86 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 18%, highlighting a continuing secular shift in the way our customer is shopping and the efficacy of our e-commerce strategies. These results were driven by more than 24 million website visits, a gain of 30% or nearly 6 million visits. 
By merchandise category, Women's Apparel and Accessories were strongest in Anthropologie, and Women's Apparel and Accessories and Men's Apparel were strongest at Urban Outfitters. Each brand's merchant team including planning, design, production and buying, transitioned from winter to spring to summer exceptionally well. As we entered the second quarter, the inventory content was fresh, compelling and appropriately balanced.
I'd like to now turn your attention to our Wholesale segment for the quarter. With the addition of Leifsdottir, revenue increased 4% to $25 million. While Free People's Wholesale revenue increased just 1% to $23 million, the composition of the business was favorable with sales to specialty stores increasing 31%, sales to department stores flat and sales to clearance outlets decreasing significantly. Leifsdottir's Wholesale revenue increased 37% to $2.5 million, and we are continually encouraged by the brand's long-term potential.
I'd like to now turn your attention to gross margin, operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter increased 459 basis points to 41.8%, driven by gains in initial margins, reduction in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product and a lower rate of occupancy expense. I'd like to reiterate that over the long term, we believe we have continued opportunity to increase initial margins and reduce markdown levels.
The organization continued to exhibit exceptional discipline in managing expenses while making strategic investments in talent, design, supply chain, technology, our Direct-to-consumer businesses and our European infrastructure. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, declined 55 basis points to 24.7%. This improvement was driven by the control and leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable expenses, which more than offset an increased accrual of incentive-based compensation expense based on our current year performance.
The company generated an impressive 17% operating margin, earning a first quarter record of $82 million in income from operations, an increase of 78% versus the same quarter last year. We also achieved our highest-ever net income for a first quarter, $53 million, an increase of 72% from the prior year, with earnings per diluted share of $0.31. 
The company's annual effective tax rate was 35.9% versus 36.1% for the same quarter last year, and the company anticipates further improvement from the current quarter annual effective tax rate for the remainder of the year related to an increase in income generated from foreign operations.
It's satisfying to begin the new fiscal year with record sales and earnings but to do so within the greater context of our long-term goals is even more gratifying. As I think of the four key growth initiatives we laid out a year ago, our organization executed admirably. Our first key initiative was to drive productivity in our core brick-and-mortar businesses through employing a variety of strategies in four areas: product, site selection and store design, store operations and marketing. The team has made numerous process and systemic improvements across all four functions. In fact, I would say that our first quarter 11% comparable store performance, our first quarter positive year-on-year performance and our 10-year comparable store average of 6% isn't just about fashion. It's about strategy and execution. The way we manage the supply chain has changed dramatically, beginning with assortment architecture and design, flowing through to production, buying and logistics and finishing with allocation. We're a different, more controlled, more nimble company and the exciting thing is that we still have a lot of opportunity ahead.
The improvements we've made in site selection and store design are also beginning to pay off. Our class of 2009 was one of our best performing groups of new stores ever. In fact, for the company as a whole, in the first quarter, our new stores had slightly higher sales per square foot averages than our comparable stores. 
We're on track with the implementation of our cross-channel database. We plan to be fully operational by the end of the third quarter, and we expect to see modest benefits in the fourth quarter. Just imagine the potential. Once we know who's shopping, what motivates them to shop, how and when they want us to communicate, how they want us to personalize their shopping experience, we expect to mine this information to better serve our customers and ultimately drive productivity for years to come.
Our second key initiative was to increase the penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to total company sales by focusing on five strategic areas: our online merchandise assortment, the websites themselves, mobile commerce, fulfillment operations and social media. I have said before that we are channel-agnostic as to how our customer reaches us and that we are unwilling to set an upwards limit to the level of penetration. Our mind shift is that we see our online experience as a robust expression of who we are as a brand, unbound by brick-and-mortar constraints. We believe, however, that for our customers and for the lifestyle experience and types of profitability products we sell, that we are in a position of strength as a multi-channel retailer. We believe our 42% gain in Direct-to-consumer sales indicates that our strategies are working. And I'd like to offer my congratulations and thanks to the myriad of people on the URBN team who have worked so hard to make this happen.
The third key initiative we discussed was international expansion, currently with an emphasis in Europe but eventually moving to the Far East and other parts of the world. The mind shift here is that we no longer view ourselves as a North American retailer. Instead, we view ourselves as a global retailer, and we are in the process of creating a strategy, structure and approach to support that goal. 
In the meantime, our European business is becoming increasingly important to the company. The Urban brand continues to narrow the performance gap between North America and Europe. And during this past first quarter, Anthropologie successfully opened its second London location and launched anthropologie.eu. 
Our final growth initiative was adding brands to the URBN portfolio so that the company is comprised of a minimum of six significant brands over the next 10 years. During the first quarter, we continued to make important progress with Terrain and Leifsdottir, and we also announced the formation of our new wedding concept, which will launch during the first quarter of calendar 2011.
Before I finish with my prepared comments this morning, I'd like to formally recognize and thank John Kyees and Ted Marlow for their exceptional contributions to our company. John has been an invaluable partner to me and the executive leadership team during his nearly seven-year tenure with the company. During John's reign, our company revenue grew from $548 million to just under $2 billion. Our yearly profit grew from $48 million to $220 million, and our market cap grew from $404 million to $5.3 billion. We will miss John's stewardship and we will also miss his kindness and decency.
Ted has been an estimable member of the Urban leadership team as well. Under Ted's nine-year watch, the Urban Outfitters brand revenue nearly sextupled to more than $900 million. He opened more than 100 new stores. He launched the Direct-to-consumer business and the European business thrived. Ted is a powerful leader, leaving behind a strong global team and creative vision and foundation that will carry the brand for years to come. Personally, and on behalf of the board and all URBN employees, we thank John and Ted for their extraordinary commitment and wish them all the best in retirement.
We welcomed Eric Artz to the company on our last call so it's now time to welcome Steve Murray. As most of you have read, Steve joined our company from the VF Corporation where he served as President of the VF Action Sports Coalition overseeing the Vans and Reef brands. Steve is a marketer and merchant at heart and brings a vast global experience and brilliant track record in growing lifestyle brands and retail concepts. We are thrilled to have Steve join our executive team and we are confident that he will continue to build the Urban Outfitters' legacy and business. 
As we have often repeated, our overarching goal is constant and simple: to grow revenue by at least 20%, to grow profit at a faster rate than sales and to reach a minimum of 20% operating income. With a 10-year revenue CAGR of 21% and a 10-year income from operations CAGR of 25%, we are on course. Furthermore, I believe we are a better company than ever with sound strategies, a world-class organization and an unerring focus on superior execution. As always, the leadership team and I look forward to continuing to inspire our customers and reward our shareholders and employees alike. 
I will now open the call to questions, and as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourselves to one question. Thank you."

And the reason why we do that is because we believe our customer appreciates complexity. And I know that that's a different model than many of our peers and I don't think it's better or worse. It's just different. It's who we are as a company. This company has never been about a single person. It was never about Dick and it's certainly not about me. It's about the group of leaders and the organization. We are an organization that spends a lot of time on choosing who we bring into the company. Once we bring people into the company, we spend a lot of time on strategy and clarity of expectations. We have terrific information systems that allow us to understand whether or not our daily, weekly, monthly, yearly decisions are working or not working. There's a high level of accountability but we do push decisions down on the company. I remember saying when I first became CEO that I no longer viewed myself as a merchant, that I viewed myself as a strategist and a manager. And each of the brands are run by merchants, and they are the people who are calling the merchandise decisions. And I think that long-term, that's the way we can manage the level of complexity we have in the business. So I am not sitting in product reviews on a brand-by-brand basis like some of my peers do. That's just not the way I envision my role. I envision my role as a mentor, as helping people with strategy, as being someone to bounce ideas off and so on. And quite frankly, if I use the two Wendys who have very successfully run Anthropologie for the last three years, they've done a better job with Anthropologie than I did. And that's to their credit and I'm sure they would credit the staff below them. And that's just the way our company works."

I'll go back to what Glen mentioned in his prepared remarks. When you look at our SG&A, we've leveraged all of our categories with the exception of incentive-based compensation, which is obviously a good thing because that means that we're tracking ahead of our internal plans. Now the leverage is somewhat muted by the investment that we also have spoken about here, investments in our Europe infrastructure, the Anthropologie new store, the e-com launch of Anthropologie, our overall technology investments and continued investments in Direct and people. So when you add all those up or to give you a sense of magnitude of those items that I just mentioned, it equates to about a third of the 22% increase. I'd also comment that as we look forward through the balance of the year, that many of those comparisons become more favorable, specifically the incentive compensation piece. So just to reconfirm, we're definitely rushing to assure that we have the infrastructure in place to achieve our growth plans, but we're not rushing to achieve our 20% operating target."

But we're also very, very cognizant of investing in our business because we all want to be here 5 and 10 and 15 years from now and we want our business to resonate with the customers even more 10 and 15 years from now than it does today. So we are putting investment, not only in areas such as IT, logistics, infrastructure and people, but we're also putting investments in product, quite frankly. So we absolutely have a plan to continue to raise IMU and lower markdowns, but we're going to do so in a very methodical way because in this economy today, we are still fighting for every dollar. I've said repeatedly, we're not back in 2007. It's still tough out there. The customer expects more and more value, more surprises and delights, and we are winning right now because our product is better. And that comes at a price. So with regard to the markdown rate, I don't know how low, low can be. I think that we've made such progress in calendar compression, such progress in the way we plan, such progress in the way we allocate, but when I look at what's on board from a systems point of view, all of the upcoming enablers, I don't know how low, low can be. I've got to think that we'll be able to make very, very good improvement, but I really -- so the message is what Eric said: We're going to work as hard as we can to grow profit faster than sales. I think we're all confident about the 20% but I don't want to give you any more insight other than that."

The first strategy is to continue to do a better job with right product, right place, right time, right price. And I could talk about that for an hour. The way we'll continue to make improvements there are in a better planning system, in continuing to compress the calendar so that we can make decisions at the last possible moment and get the inventory as correct as possible so that we can allocate more effectively. When you think about the stores that we have, not only in North America but around the world, we cover a variety of weather zones, fashion types. We have different kinds of price elasticities, depending upon where we trade, and the more we can micro allocate, the more productive we can make each of our stores. So there's a lot of opportunities still in the way that we plan our merchandise, buy it, design it and allocate it and price it, quite frankly. Number two is our site selection. Now I was really pleased to review the results and see that our new store group was more productive than our comparable store group this past quarter because it means we're doing a better job picking sites. We're using empirical data, objective data now, and we're also being smarter about the way we design our stores. So that's important. Next, the way we operate our stores. And those of you who know anything about store operations know that a great store manager can probably impact a comp number by as much as 25% or more, and we're working as a company to understand to kind of institutionalize what it is that a great store manager does to make sure that we do that across all of our stores. The way one manages a $15 million store is different than the way one manages a $10 million store or a $5 million store, and we're working harder to understand what those differences are and make sure we are appropriately distortive. And last, and certainly not least, is this database, this multi-channel database. Let me remind everyone that right now, we do not know who shops at our stores. We don't know -- when we communicate to people [indiscernible] we have a vague sense are shopping our stores, we don't know if that communication works or doesn't work. We don't know how often our customers come in, what they buy with what and so on. So it's like flying blind. And when our database is up and running, which we expect to be towards the end of the third quarter, we will begin to collect this information, and over time, we will have robust information. And really the reason for us having this information is that the more we can know about our customers, the better job we can do servicing them. So it's not about shoving additional product down their throats. It's really about doing a better job, understanding their wants and needs, their timing, how they want to be communicated with and so on. And because we haven't done this, we don't know what it's going to be worth. My hunch, my intuition tells me it's going to be worth quite a bit. In terms of the targets that we have, we have quite a bit of variation within our existing store base. So we have stores, if I look at Anthropologie, which on a net basis, trades at slightly over $800 a foot, we have many stores that trade in excess of $2,000 a foot. So I really, much like the Direct penetration, I don't want to put a limit on it. Our internal goal is to try to take the last 10-year comp average, which is six, and to try to replicate it over the next 10 years. And so if you just take $800 a foot and multiply it times six, 10 years out, you'll get to a number. I hope we can hit that. We certainly have a lot of work on our plate to continue to drive comps."

Make no mistake, last year was a buyer's market and I think at the supply level, we lost a lot of supply last year because the demand came down and all of the sudden, there's a feeding frenzy in people need product.

And I think that our problem and just like bad weather or good weather or bad economy or good economy, that's our problem and we have to be smart about it.

The higher penetration of e-commerce helps, absolutely but so will a larger business in Europe so that we can leverage the existing infrastructure we have there. So we've made an investment in Terrain and Leifsdottir. As those businesses get larger and go from making losses to making profits, that’ll help.

As we mentioned, we are in the process of rolling out TradeStone. We have a couple of hundred vendors on TradeStone which represent about 90% of our own brand; vendors we think some efficiencies on purchase order side.

When I look at the budget that we prepared over the last few years and I look at the results that have come out of those budgets, I'm very, very proud of the work that the organization has done because I feel that we've spent money wisely. And I mean, we're sitting on three cash machines: Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People, and I think from a business point of view, it's very prudent to continue to invest in those businesses. They all have a lot of runway. They're all very profitable and they're all investments that we can make in those three businesses to continue to drive them. I've said in the prepared remarks that we no longer define ourselves as a North American retailer. We define ourselves as a global retailer and I think that we have a lot of work to do in that area. I used to, in my own mind, think that international sales could be 5%, 10%, 15% 20%, 25% of our business. Who the heck knows? We may find out over time that it could be 50% or more of our business. So we have to work to understand that. We have to make sure that we have the right infrastructure from an IT, logistics, talent, legal, et cetera point of view to ensure our success. And we're not going to do that if we don't expect to make money doing it. But if we do expect to make money, we will make those investments.

I'm looking at Barbara Rozsas across the table from me and I think we have something like 165 calendars in the company -- close to a 165 calendars in the company and what that means is that virtually every product category and every brand has at least one of its own category. And some of the product categories, the bigger ones have multiple calendars. So it's a very, very complex answer. What I would say to you is we have taken weeks off of the calendar in total, and if we are properly positioned on fabric, in the right kind of product, I have seen our group be able to move products within two to three weeks. And that’s an if. We need to own the fabric, the factory needs to be on board that we're going to place a follow-up order with them, but we were never able to do that a few years ago. What I can tell you is that we are much, much more liquid, 90 days and beyond than we have ever been. I mean, I look at our open-to-buys every week but I always look at them the morning of an earnings call or the night before an earnings call, and I'm increasingly struck and impressed by how liquid we are in the following quarter. So not the quarter that we're in but the quarter beyond that and the quarters beyond that. We have much more flexibility than we ever had.

And he has done a lot of wonderful research work in terms of helping us understand size of markets, logistical and legal complexities, ability to make money in market and so on. And as I said in prior earnings calls, 70% of -- the size of the business in Europe is actually about 10% larger than the size of the business in North America. 70% of that opportunity is in five markets: the U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Germany. And I think we have an opportunity to be strategic about that 70%. What we're doing, Richard, is really doing a very thorough due diligence in each market. I think we'll have kind of a market-by-market approach as opposed to the opportunistic approach, which has probably characterized our first 10 or 12 years in Europe. Your question about using the Direct-to-consumer as a guide, absolutely. Calvin will have Merkle. We’ll have the database in Europe in about 18 months, so I think once we have the database there. Also in terms of the single SKU that Calvin talked about, once we have the single SKU in Europe, so we share a product SKU between North America and Europe, we'll be able to do an even better job with that. But I think we will use analytic tools for real estate in Europe just like we use here. We'll use the Direct-to-customer database like we use here, and we’ll use research like we use here. And I think that we have moved slower in Europe, Richard, than we've moved in North America, but we have enough signs in the business in both of our brands to be pretty confident moving forward. We are also starting to shift Free People. We opened up Cortez. We have plans to open up several other accounts in Europe and so all three brands will be in Europe. With regards to the Far East and other parts of the world, we'll approach it the same way we did with Europe. We're in the process now of due diligence. We're looking at real estate, speaking with potential leaders. We'll likely go with one brand first, but I think we would follow with a second brand pretty quickly."

It leads one way in Urban, one quarter another way in other Anthropologie one quarter and generally speaking, the differences aren't that significant. If there's extreme weather in the country, sometimes it’ll impact that. If there's extreme geographic economic issues, it may highlight that. But right now, I don't think there's anything to read into any of the geographic data. And by and large other than the natural differences relating to weather and fashion differences, the business is pretty consistent. With regard to the flow of business from month to month, as I said, March was strongest for us but on a two-year basis, April was actually strongest for us. I continue to say that I do not believe we are out of the woods. I'm not optimistic about the nature of the economy. I think that there are many positive signs but I think this is going to be a slow and lengthy recovery. We are not overly confident about our business. I think we're doing good job. I think we're doing a great job creatively. I think we're offering the customer great value. I think we're executing beautifully and I think we're getting market share. But as I said earlier, it's not easy. And I see a lot of our peer group quite promotional. I was concerned by some of the April numbers that I read myself but that's them. Our business, we had a great quarter, and it was -- April was our best month on a two-year basis and you'll learn about the next quarter in the next earnings call."

URBN is a company that I've long admired as a consumer equity research analyst at BlackRock and especially as a customer. Our Investor Relations objective is simple: To provide clear, comprehensive, timely and insightful communication within the guidelines of the regulatory framework. To that end, we’ve made the following changes: For the first through third quarters, we will report sales and earnings simultaneously on the third Monday following quarter’s end. We will continue our tradition of reporting holiday sales in early January, and we’ll report fourth quarter sales and year-end earnings on the first Monday in March. Our sales and earnings release, along with a detailed management commentary, will be posted to our corporate website, www.urbanoutfittersinc.com at 4 p.m. Eastern time on the day of our release. The management commentary will address many of your housekeeping questions so that during the earnings call, you may focus your attention on more strategic issues. Our earnings call will take place at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard time on the day of the release. We will begin to report sales at a brand and channel level and will post historical comparisons on our corporate website for your reference. The earnings call will close sharply at the end of the hour, so our one-question rule will be strictly adhered to. In the event you have additional questions, feel free to follow up with me after the call. Finally, as usual, the text of the conference call will be posted on the corporate website immediately following the call. 
I've had the good fortune to meet many of you over the last several weeks, and I'd like to thank you for the warm reception and for your feedback in crafting these new policies. I'll now turn the call back over to Glen."

The following summarizes our second quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year. Net sales increased 20% to $552 million. Income from operations grew 35% to $107 million, resulting in an operating margin of 19.4%. Net income increased 46% to $72 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Comparable retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel rose 11% with increases of 13%, 24% and 9% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 7%. 
Direct-to-consumer sales rose 36% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenues increased 16% to $30 million. Gross profit margins improved 173 basis points, driven by a lower rate of markdowns to clear seasonal inventories, leveraging our store occupancy expenses due to increases in comparable store sales and improvements in initial merchandise margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of sales, declined 52 basis points to 23.2%. Comparable retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 3% higher at quarter’s end. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $165 million on a year-over-year basis to $749 million. 
I'll now provide more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $46 million. The company opened seven new stores in the quarter, three Anthropologie stores, one Free People store and three Urban Outfitters stores, bringing the global store count to 342. We expect to open approximately 45 new stores during fiscal 2011. 
Within the quarter, total company comparable store sales were positive each month, but strongest in June followed by July. On a two-year basis, total company comparable store sales in the second quarter were consistent with the first quarter and strongest in July. By region, sales at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were positive in all locations, with Anthropologie strongest in the West and Urban Outfitters strongest in the South. 
By store venue, sales at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were strongest in the malls, likely driven by the summer season's record heat. For stores, transaction counts increased 6%. Units per transaction increased 1% and average unit selling prices were flat. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 36% to $97 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 17.5% with results largely driven by a 28% increase in website traffic to nearly 25 million visits. 
For Retail segment sales, women's apparel drove the strongest absolute comparable increases across all brands. Wholesale segment sales for the quarter increased 16% to $30 million, driven by a 14% increase at Free People and a 38% increase at Leifsdottir. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to gross margin, operating expenses and income. Gross margins for the quarter improved 173 basis points to 42.5%, driven by a reduction in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product, a lower rate of occupancy expense and improvements in initial margins. With the initial margin gain, it is important to note that comparisons were favorable to both the prior-year's quarter and the first quarter of this year. The company managed inventory well throughout the quarter with comparable Retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, just 3% higher at quarter's end. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter as a percentage of sales declined 52 basis points to 23.2%, driven by the control and leveraging of direct store expenses. The company's effective tax rate was 33.3% for the quarter versus 38.3% for the prior comparable quarter. The improved tax rate is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign operations, as well as a one-time federal rehabilitation credit earned during the quarter related to our newest building at the company's headquarters in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. This one-time federal rehabilitation credit resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact on earnings per share for the quarter. 
The company generated an impressive 19.4% operating margin, earning a second quarter record of $107 million in income from operations, an increase of 35% versus the same quarter last year. The company also achieved its highest ever net income for a second quarter, $72 million, an increase of 46% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.42. 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-over-year by $165 million to $749 million at quarter’s end, but declined by $24 million compared to the end of the first quarter of this year. The company repurchased and retired 2 million common shares for $68 million during the quarter, leaving 4.8 million shares remaining on the current authorization to buy up to a total of 8 million shares. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Glen."

First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to the entire URBN team for an exceptional quarter. Virtually every brand, every channel, every region and every shared service group delivered superior results. I have said that I believe challenging times have the potential to generate renewal and strength, including heightened discipline and greater creativity. I believe our second quarter results illustrate the efficacy of our vision, operating model and strategies, and most importantly, I believe they illustrate the excellence of our team. 
When we discussed the economic environment during our last call, I remarked that we didn't see much change from the second half of 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. And I attributed our results to execution as opposed to any secular changes with the consumer. While there's considerably more stability than in the fall of 2008, we believe we're facing a slow and lengthy recovery that will be punctuated by periods of uncertainty and inconsistency. Thus, we are focused on executing our business as nimbly as we have over the last several quarters with an emphasis on sound inventory and expense management. 
What's relatively constant, however, are the changes we've seen in our customer. Her view of luxury and value has changed profoundly in the new normal, and thanks to new media, her level of awareness is heightened and moves at warp speed. In our world, this means the customer’s looking for authenticity, scarcity and freshness. In other words, she continues to respond to truly compelling, differentiated product. We continue to see minimal evidence of price elasticity, but maximum evidence of newness elasticity. Put simply, the customer is more discriminating than ever. 
I know the subject of sourcing is top-of-mind for many of you. We believe the environment has become more challenging as the balance of supply and demand has shifted throughout the year and as the manufacturing landscape has changed in China. Our organization anticipated these changes and made appropriate adjustments to our sourcing strategies. So while there's certainly pressure on the rate of our initial margin improvement, we believe there's continued opportunity to improve costs, especially over the long-term. 
Before we finish with our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of our four key growth initiatives: Driving brick and mortar productivity, increasing our e-commerce penetration, accelerating international expansion and adding new brands to the URBN portfolio. It's satisfying to achieve record sales and earnings, but to do so while making substantial investments in our long-term growth strategies is even more gratifying. 
Since we’ve spent a considerable amount of time talking about the detail behind each initiative, I'll just provide some highlights today. We're on track with a myriad of systems implementations, including TradeStone, Sterling and Merkle. We're driving continued gains in e-commerce penetration through the successful execution of a variety of strategies. We're laying the groundwork for a more aggressive European expansion through investment and talent, systems and logistics. We're laying the groundwork for a 2012 entry into Tokyo, and of course, we're continuing to invest in and shape our new brands Terrain, Leifsdottir and our wedding concept. 
Many of you have asked me how the company manages the breadth and complexity of our business and how we protect our core, while pursuing a multitude of growth initiatives. I've responded by saying that our company has thrived over the years with an organizational design and culture that engenders entrepreneurship and ownership. Overarching financial goals haven't changed in the nearly 17 years we've been public, and our team has always collaboratively established the company vision, objective and strategies. 
As we’ve grown larger, we've developed more formalized means of internal communication and measurement, but as always, the initiatives are managed by a broad spectrum of talented leaders throughout the organization. I'd like to once again thank those leaders and the rest of the URBN team for a truly outstanding quarter and thank our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now open the call to questions, and as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourselves to one question. Thank you."

In fact, you heard Eric in our prepared comments say that our AUR was flat for the quarter, and in fact, it's been flat for the year-to-date. So what I said was I coined this new term called newness sensitivity or newness elasticity, but we are not seeing price elasticity. This is something that I have said repeatedly over the last several quarters. When we first kind of faced the economic tsunami of the second half of 2008, we created an assortment that was very tiered with price points and our customers voted to keep the prices flat on a year-in, year-out basis. So it's not that we didn't offer lower price points, it’s that's not where our customers went. With regard to costs, as I said in my prepared comments, it's certainly more difficult than it was a year ago. There's a reduction in supply, there's more demand and the reduction in supply quite simply certain factories went out of business a year ago when the demand got reduced so much. So there's more demand, less supply and there’s certainly changes going on in China. But as I said in our prepared comments, Barbara Rozsas, our head of sourcing, and her group anticipated these changes and they began to put strategies in place as early as the middle of last year. Things like dual sourcing, changes in the way we make product, changes in the way we ship product and so on. So while the IMU improvements, I would say are more challenging, we expect to see continued opportunities in cost of goods."

And I would say we're as conservative today as we were three months ago. As I said in my prepared remarks, there's uncertainty and there's inconsistency. And the way we're dealing with that is by working to be creatively better every day and by being very disciplined with regard to inventory and expenses. I'm thrilled with our inventory, comps up three on 11 total, total Direct-to-consumer comp in sales number [ph 35:52]. And Dana, so that's basically it. I am not bullish about the second half of the year. We have our ear to the ground. We pay close attention to the tells in the business on a day-in, day-out basis.

And we've talked about in the past leveraging maybe 10 to 12 basis points for every point of additional comp beyond that. That still holds true. I think for the long-term, however, the one piece I would want to highlight relative to the balance of this year is that we're looking at opening 29 new stores in the second half, which is an increase of 11 stores over what we did the prior year. So when you think about the longer-term implications of occupancy, I think you have to be mindful of the fact that we're going to see some pre-opening costs affect this and specifically in the third quarter on the occupancy line. When we talk about SG&A, I would think we always begin this conversation reminding everyone that one of our guiding financial objectives is to grow profits faster than sales. So we're very pleased with the fact that we've leveraged our SG&A line in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and I think long-term again, it would be our focus to continue to leverage SG&A. There is another highlight here as well for you, which would be some of the second half things that are occurring, we put it in our management commentary that we've committed to a distribution and fulfillment center in Europe. We're making some additional investments in our international infrastructure, especially as we start to look to Asia. We also talked about our new Navy building here, Navy Yard building for Free People. So a combination of those things again. While our long-term goal remains to leverage the SG&A line, I think in the near-term and specifically the second half, we're going to face some slightly more difficult comparisons relative to those items."

Let me remind you that I kind of cringe when I hear the word teen because the teen population generates less than 10% of our business as a company. And even as a brand, it's a relatively insignificant portion of the business. So the Urban customer is just dead on that early-20-something-year-old college kid. And with regard to fashion, there's a lot of trend. As you know, I won't go into trend on the call, but there is a lot of trend, there's a lot of change.

So we'll have a much better sense of the synergies. But anecdotally, we know when we drop the catalog that people go into the stores. We know that people buy things online and return them in the stores or buy things in the stores and return them online. So it's really important that we get the organization looking at all of the channels through the lens of the customer.

Income from operations grew 35% to $107 million, resulting in an operating margin of 19.",784,"Thank you, Glen. The following summarizes our second quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year. Net sales increased 20% to $552 million. Income from operations grew 35% to $107 million, resulting in an operating margin of 19.4%. Net income increased 46% to $72 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Comparable retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel rose 11% with increases of 13%, 24% and 9% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 7%. 
Direct-to-consumer sales rose 36% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenues increased 16% to $30 million. Gross profit margins improved 173 basis points, driven by a lower rate of markdowns to clear seasonal inventories, leveraging our store occupancy expenses due to increases in comparable store sales and improvements in initial merchandise margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of sales, declined 52 basis points to 23.2%. Comparable retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 3% higher at quarter’s end. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $165 million on a year-over-year basis to $749 million. 
I'll now provide more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $46 million. The company opened seven new stores in the quarter, three Anthropologie stores, one Free People store and three Urban Outfitters stores, bringing the global store count to 342. We expect to open approximately 45 new stores during fiscal 2011. 
Within the quarter, total company comparable store sales were positive each month, but strongest in June followed by July. On a two-year basis, total company comparable store sales in the second quarter were consistent with the first quarter and strongest in July. By region, sales at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were positive in all locations, with Anthropologie strongest in the West and Urban Outfitters strongest in the South. 
By store venue, sales at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were strongest in the malls, likely driven by the summer season's record heat. For stores, transaction counts increased 6%. Units per transaction increased 1% and average unit selling prices were flat. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 36% to $97 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 17.5% with results largely driven by a 28% increase in website traffic to nearly 25 million visits. 
For Retail segment sales, women's apparel drove the strongest absolute comparable increases across all brands. Wholesale segment sales for the quarter increased 16% to $30 million, driven by a 14% increase at Free People and a 38% increase at Leifsdottir. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to gross margin, operating expenses and income. Gross margins for the quarter improved 173 basis points to 42.5%, driven by a reduction in merchandise markdowns to clear seasonal product, a lower rate of occupancy expense and improvements in initial margins. With the initial margin gain, it is important to note that comparisons were favorable to both the prior-year's quarter and the first quarter of this year. The company managed inventory well throughout the quarter with comparable Retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, just 3% higher at quarter's end. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter as a percentage of sales declined 52 basis points to 23.2%, driven by the control and leveraging of direct store expenses. The company's effective tax rate was 33.3% for the quarter versus 38.3% for the prior comparable quarter. The improved tax rate is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign operations, as well as a one-time federal rehabilitation credit earned during the quarter related to our newest building at the company's headquarters in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. This one-time federal rehabilitation credit resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact on earnings per share for the quarter. 
The company generated an impressive 19.4% operating margin, earning a second quarter record of $107 million in income from operations, an increase of 35% versus the same quarter last year. The company also achieved its highest ever net income for a second quarter, $72 million, an increase of 46% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.42. 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-over-year by $165 million to $749 million at quarter’s end, but declined by $24 million compared to the end of the first quarter of this year. The company repurchased and retired 2 million common shares for $68 million during the quarter, leaving 4.8 million shares remaining on the current authorization to buy up to a total of 8 million shares. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Glen."

Virtually every brand, every channel, every region and every shared service group delivered superior results. I have said that I beli",682,"Thank you, Eric. First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to the entire URBN team for an exceptional quarter. Virtually every brand, every channel, every region and every shared service group delivered superior results. I have said that I believe challenging times have the potential to generate renewal and strength, including heightened discipline and greater creativity. I believe our second quarter results illustrate the efficacy of our vision, operating model and strategies, and most importantly, I believe they illustrate the excellence of our team. 
When we discussed the economic environment during our last call, I remarked that we didn't see much change from the second half of 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. And I attributed our results to execution as opposed to any secular changes with the consumer. While there's considerably more stability than in the fall of 2008, we believe we're facing a slow and lengthy recovery that will be punctuated by periods of uncertainty and inconsistency. Thus, we are focused on executing our business as nimbly as we have over the last several quarters with an emphasis on sound inventory and expense management. 
What's relatively constant, however, are the changes we've seen in our customer. Her view of luxury and value has changed profoundly in the new normal, and thanks to new media, her level of awareness is heightened and moves at warp speed. In our world, this means the customer’s looking for authenticity, scarcity and freshness. In other words, she continues to respond to truly compelling, differentiated product. We continue to see minimal evidence of price elasticity, but maximum evidence of newness elasticity. Put simply, the customer is more discriminating than ever. 
I know the subject of sourcing is top-of-mind for many of you. We believe the environment has become more challenging as the balance of supply and demand has shifted throughout the year and as the manufacturing landscape has changed in China. Our organization anticipated these changes and made appropriate adjustments to our sourcing strategies. So while there's certainly pressure on the rate of our initial margin improvement, we believe there's continued opportunity to improve costs, especially over the long-term. 
Before we finish with our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of our four key growth initiatives: Driving brick and mortar productivity, increasing our e-commerce penetration, accelerating international expansion and adding new brands to the URBN portfolio. It's satisfying to achieve record sales and earnings, but to do so while making substantial investments in our long-term growth strategies is even more gratifying. 
Since we’ve spent a considerable amount of time talking about the detail behind each initiative, I'll just provide some highlights today. We're on track with a myriad of systems implementations, including TradeStone, Sterling and Merkle. We're driving continued gains in e-commerce penetration through the successful execution of a variety of strategies. We're laying the groundwork for a more aggressive European expansion through investment and talent, systems and logistics. We're laying the groundwork for a 2012 entry into Tokyo, and of course, we're continuing to invest in and shape our new brands Terrain, Leifsdottir and our wedding concept. 
Many of you have asked me how the company manages the breadth and complexity of our business and how we protect our core, while pursuing a multitude of growth initiatives. I've responded by saying that our company has thrived over the years with an organizational design and culture that engenders entrepreneurship and ownership. Overarching financial goals haven't changed in the nearly 17 years we've been public, and our team has always collaboratively established the company vision, objective and strategies. 
As we’ve grown larger, we've developed more formalized means of internal communication and measurement, but as always, the initiatives are managed by a broad spectrum of talented leaders throughout the organization. I'd like to once again thank those leaders and the rest of the URBN team for a truly outstanding quarter and thank our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now open the call to questions, and as is our custom, I ask each of you to limit yourselves to one question. Thank you."

In fact, you heard Eric in our prepared comments say that our AUR was flat for the quarter, and in fact, it's been flat for the year-to-date. So what I said was I coined this new term called newness sensitivity or newness elasticity, but we are not seeing price elasticity. This is something that I have said repeatedly over the last several quarters. When we first kind of faced the economic tsunami of the second half of 2008, we created an assortment that was very tiered with price points and our customers voted to keep the prices flat on a year-in, year-out basis. So it's not that we didn't offer lower price points, it’s that's not where our customers went. With regard to costs, as I said in my prepared comments, it's certainly more difficult than it was a year ago. There's a reduction in supply, there's more demand and the reduction in supply quite simply certain factories went out of business a year ago when the demand got reduced so much. So there's more demand, less supply and there’s certainly changes going on in China. But as I said in our prepared comments, Barbara Rozsas, our head of sourcing, and her group anticipated these changes and they began to put strategies in place as early as the middle of last year. Things like dual sourcing, changes in the way we make product, changes in the way we ship product and so on. So while the IMU improvements, I would say are more challenging, we expect to see continued opportunities in cost of goods."

And we've talked about in the past leveraging maybe 10 to 12 basis points for every point of additional comp beyond that. That still holds true. I think for the long-term, however, the one piece I would want to highlight relative to the balance of this year is that we're looking at opening 29 new stores in the second half, which is an increase of 11 stores over what we did the prior year. So when you think about the longer-term implications of occupancy, I think you have to be mindful of the fact that we're going to see some pre-opening costs affect this and specifically in the third quarter on the occupancy line. When we talk about SG&A, I would think we always begin this conversation reminding everyone that one of our guiding financial objectives is to grow profits faster than sales. So we're very pleased with the fact that we've leveraged our SG&A line in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and I think long-term again, it would be our focus to continue to leverage SG&A.

If we're less lucky, if we make some mistakes, if the fashion that we sell ends up shifting mid-quarter, then we may spend markdown money for the last year, we might even exceed last year. I think generally speaking over the next several years, we have an opportunity to improve our markdown rates because we are becoming more systematic at the way we plan our business. We've compressed lead times, which allows us to buy more correctly and so on. But with regard to the next quarter, the next 10 to 12 weeks, I certainly know what we have planned. But I don't even know what it's going to look like at this point."

I think the team feels that we have exactly the distribution we want to have. And personally, I think the shoes look sensational. We are planning on opening a store next year. My guess is that it would open sometime in the first half of the year. And we’ll continue to learn. It's a small business, it's a young business, and we expect there are going to be lots of starts and stops over the next couple of years, but we're pleased. With regard to wedding, we saw the first dresses, the first samples, I think about two and a half, three weeks ago. We actually sold our first dress to someone within the company. It was a joyous event. The dresses look sensational. We're on track to launch next February. Again, I think the dresses look good.

The climate is an inconsistent climate. I would say if I go back to the wonder years of 2007, the business was more predictable. It's less predictable now. I don't want anyone on this call just assuming that it's business as usual because it's not. We're at war, and we're fighting for our business every single day. And how do we deal with that? By having tremendous discipline as an organization. Tremendous discipline around assortment planning, around product design, around the production calendar, around inventory management, around payroll control. When I look back over the first six months of this year, the organization did a tremendous job at execution. But as I said in the last earnings call, and as I said in my prepared remarks, the wins that we've had this year are more about execution and less about any kind of secular changes in the economy. I don't think it's getting worse. I certainly don't think we're headed for a double dip. But I don't think it's getting better anytime soon. And I, quite frankly, don't want anyone in the organization think it's getting any better anytime soon."

The following summarizes our Third Quarter Fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year: Net sales increased 13% to $574 million.
Income from operations grew 9% to $105 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18.3%.
Net income increased 17% to $73 million or $0.43 per diluted share.
Comparable Retail Segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, rose 6% with increases of 5%, 29% and 5% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters respectively. 
Total comparable store sales increased 1%.
Direct-to-consumer comparable sales rose 31% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. 
Wholesale revenues increased 13% to $34 million. 
Gross profit margins decreased 39 basis points, largely due to higher shipping expenses associated with an increase in International shipments in our direct-to-consumer channel along with higher occupancy cost due to the timing of increased year-over-year store openings. 
Selling, general and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points to 22.9%. 
Comparable retail segment inventories which include our direct-to-consumer channel were 8% higher at quarters end while comparable retail store inventories increased 1%. 
Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $38 million on a year- over-year basis to $690 million. 
I’ll now provide more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter, starting with sales. 
New and non-comparable store sales contributed $46 million.
The Company opened 13 new stores in the quarter - five Anthropologie stores, including one Accessory and Footwear only store, two Free People stores and six Urban Outfitters stores, including one in Europe bring the Global store count to 355.
Within the quarter, total company comparable store sales were strongest in August followed by October. On a two-year basis total company comparable store and retail segment sales improved throughout the quarter with October being the strongest month. 
By region, sales at Anthropologie and Free People were strongest in the West and sales at Urban Outfitters were strongest in Continental Europe followed by the Mid-Atlantic in North America. 
By store venue, sales at both Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were strongest in Lifestyle centers and sales at Free People were strongest in street locations. For stores, average unit selling prices decreased 2% while units per transaction and transaction counts each increased to 1%. 
Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 32% to $105 million, the penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than 2 percentage points to 18.4%, with results largely driven by a 32% increase in website traffic to nearly 30 million visits. 
For retail segment sales, footwear and accessories were strongest at Urban Outfitters and Free People while women’s apparel was strongest at Anthropologie. 
Wholesale Segment sales for the quarter increased 13% to $34 million driven by a 17% increase at Free People.
I’d now like to turn your attention to gross margin, operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter decreased 39 basis points to 41.1%. The decrease in gross margins was due largely to higher shipping costs associated with an increased penetration of International Direct-to-consumer business as well as the impact of preopening occupancy cost from an additional 11 store openings in the second half of the current year versus the same period last year. Merchandise margins were flat as the company controlled inventory well throughout the quarter and product cost headwinds were judiciously managed.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points, primarily due to investments in systems and our International infrastructure including preopening costs for our new distribution and fulfillment center in Europe.
The company's effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter versus 36.1% for the prior comparable quarter. This decrease was due to the favorable impact of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions. The current year federal rehabilitation credit and favorable revisions to state tax estimates resulting from tax return filings. The Company generated an impressive 18.3% operating margin earning a third quarter record of $105 million in income from operations, an increase of 9% versus the same quarter last year. 
The Company also achieved its highest ever-net income for a third quarter, $73 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.43, a 19% increase over the comparable period last year. 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-to-year by $38 million to $690 million at quarters end. The Company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for $133 million during the quarter leaving $491,533 shares remaining on the current authorization to buy up to a total of eight million shares.
I'd like to now turn your attention to the fourth quarter. We believe we are well positioned as we head into the holiday season and while we will not provide specific guidance, it will be helpful for you to consider the following. We began the fourth quarter with an appropriate level of inventory liquidity providing us the continuing ability to respond to shifting consumer and fashion trends. We are planning for fourth quarter comparable store sales performance to be consistent with third quarter results, coupled with continued strong direct growth. We project to open 16 new stores in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a sequential improvement in operating margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarters similar to last year. However, that result will occur only if we experience positive comparable stores sales to leverage occupancy and fixed expenses as well as continued success in controlling product input costs. 
We expect our tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter. As we look forward to fiscal year 2012 we are planning for low single-digit comparable store sales growth, continued strength in our Direct-to-consumer channel and the slight acceleration of our new store opening schedule with a targeted range of 50 to 55 new locations. 
Finally, we expect to make continued investments in people, technology and our International expansion but will do so within the confines of our continued goal to grow profits fester than sales. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Glen.

This quarter as in quarters previous, we have been adapting to a customer who is herself adjusting to the new economy. Today she expects not just fashion but compelling design. She expects not just value but quality and she expects not just customer service but a warm, exciting in store environment and a seamless online experience. 
On these fronts, assortment, value, operational excellence, customer experience and of course brand authenticity, I believe we have continued to outperform. There's been a considerable amount of discussion around the current fashion shift, which I first referenced during our previous call. Rather than dissect that fashion itself which I will not do because of competitive factors, let me discuss how we intend to respond to this change or better put, this opportunity.
Fashion cycles are good for our business. We are early adopt a merchants, selling to early adopt a customers. In fact, the ability to recognize change before the market at large has been one of our company's defining competencies playing a key role in how we've grown our customer base, become a trusted source for fashion and remained relevant throughout our 40-year history. And while it's true that customers may pull back on spending during a period of fashion transition until they're confident, with new trends we have more tools and I believe a more rigorous approach to managing these cycles than in years past.  
What's different? We have our Direct-to-consumer business which helps us to access, test and size trends with a quantitative fact based approach. We have planning and allocation systems and methodologies which allows us to control and accurately balance our inventory and on order against trends in the business. And we have our nimble supply chain where a significantly compressed calendar enables us to adapt to change with ever-increasing flexibility and speed. 
It's these tools that support our goal of navigating through fashion cycles while delivering a relatively consistent financial performance and simultaneously getting market share. 
Let me turn your attention to another topic of much discussion - sourcing. As 
I stated on our last call our team led by a long tenured group of professionals both here and abroad anticipated much of the change that is occurring. The team made and will continue to make appropriate adjustments to our sourcing and logistical strategies working to optimize every lever in our supply chain. Marketing improvement wont' be easy or automatic especially in the short-term but we believe given the nature of our product, supply chain, partners and process that we have continued long-term opportunity for improvement. 
Before I finish with our prepared remarks I'd like to remind you of our four key growth initiatives. Driving brick and mortar productivity, increasing our e-commerce penetration, accelerating International expansion and adding new brands to the URBN portfolio. Since we've spent a considerable amount of time talking about the detail behind each initiative I'll just provide some highlights today. We're on track with our key systems implementations, including Tradestone, our supply chain management tool, Sterling, the software that will ultimately enable us to have a single inventory across all channels and Merkel, our consumer insight database. 
We're driving continued gains in e-commerce penetration through the successful execution of the myriad of product, sight, fulfillment, social media and mobile strategies. Based on our success in Europe we're laying the groundwork for a more aggressive expansion through investment and talent, systems and logistics including our first fulfillment and distribution centers which will open in summer 2011. We're beginning to plan our entry into the Japanese market which will likely serve as a gateway to other Asia-Pacific markets. 
And finally we're continuing to invest in and shape our new brands, Terrain, Leifsdottir, and our wedding concept, Beholden.
In closing I'd like to express my gratitude to the URBN team for an excellent quarter. Our results always are a reflection of the team’s dedication, discipline, creativity and skill. No matter the external circumstances our people adroitly manage that which they can control and as a result they are consistent in their deliverance of superior results.
Once again today’s record sales and earnings are a testament to that capacity. We believe that URBN remains one of the true growth stories in retail with an opportunity to more than double the North American store count with our existing brands, a best of class, rapidly expanding Direct-to-consumer business. A significant opportunity for international growth, a growing portfolio of new concepts to fuel future expansion and a highly strategic, systematic and controlled approach which we believe will enable us to continue to grow profits faster than sales.  
As always, I'd like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the URBN team for their outstanding commitment and to our shareholders for their continued support. I will now open the call to questions and as is our custom we will limit the queries to one per caller.

There is a lot of change in what we're selling. I won't comment specifically on what those changes were but I will say that we have very, very clear direction. Free People had a bang-up quarter and there's a lot of learning in those results that the other brands can use. We also had a bang-up Direct-to-consumer quarter and there was a lot of learning in there that the retail businesses can use. So we feel, I think given the fact that we are in the midst of what we would call a fairly significant fashion cycle change I'm thrilled with the group, with the performance of the entire group and I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing in terms of the specifics in each of the businesses.

I will add that in terms of the first half of the year we will be challenged a little bit more with those comparisons relative to the investments that we are making internationally and specifically the Rushton, D.C. investment. So I think we'll have more to say to you at the fourth quarter call relative to how we see the phasing occurring over there but I'd just like to state that generally on an annual basis we'll be looking to leverage.

And it's a testament to the group’s ability to navigate this change. I will say big over little was not an easy change for the customers to wear, to understand and I think where we're headed is a much more customer friendly and quite frankly much more URBN friendly cycle.

We’ve been in business with these people a long time. They're our partners and we're working through this together. The group has done a myriad of things. First of all we're dual sourced in many, many product categories. We have a lower percentage of exposure in China than I believe most of our peer group does. It's important to remember that the raw materials comprise the lower part of our comps and most of our peer groups. 
Cotton for example is a typical product that we sell is less than 10% of the cost. It's also important to remember that we're not in low cost factories for the most part. Our products have a lot of make in them and we tend to be in factories that have higher than average wages and therefore they're less sensitive to the wage changes. We also quite frankly there's a lot more design in most of the products that we sell so I think there's less price sensitivity particularly if we're into a fashion change earlier like I believe we are right now. So as I said in our prepared remarks it's not easy. There's a lot of headwinds. We don't expect a lot of improvement in the short-term but we expect continued improvement.

Dana, I won't go into the fashion and so I won't tell you the specifics of what we're learning from Free People but the brands. We're not a company where if we have the best seller in one brand I take a sample of it and I run it to another brands building but we are a company that's aware of what’s going on in each of the brands. So certainly, Steve at Urban, Wendy at Anthropologies, Meg at Free People, they're aware of what's going on with the other brands and if there's the kind of positive trend that there is at Free People, everybody's going to be paying attention to it. 
With regard to Direct-to-consumer it's always easier for us to manipulate the Web site and kind of get to the best product, best message almost immediately. If we have a million dollars of inventory in a store, if we absolutely love half of that inventory and we're just lukewarm on the other half, but we still have to deal with that other half over a six to eight week period. Online we can make it look as if we love everything that we're selling and we can manipulate the visual execution so that we downplay what we don't love. And it's just easier for us to project a more relevant, more compelling message online. So that's really the difference and in terms of you and the rest of the group on the call I would encourage you to go to our Web site and as I always say if it's a regular price then it's front and forward, it's good. If it's been marked down recently or it's in the back of the store or the back of the Web site it's not so good.

So yes I think that the improvement that we saw from September to October is in part related to the quality of the inventory content. Some of the new products hit and didn't do well, a good amount of it hit and did quite well, so as a merchant, what I and all of the merchants in the organization look for is, they look for inventory that hits and turns quickly. So they look for an immediate reaction and our stores are so heavily trafficked that we can deliver something and literally within 24 hours, 36 hours we know what we have on our hands. And I want to sound positive on this call because we have clear direction of what people want.

It was a very dramatic change for people and I think it was much more difficult to understand.
Now of course with regard to marketing we have our catalogs, we have our Web sites. We have blogs. We have press so we do everything we can and of course we have our stores. We do everything we can to get the message out in terms of what we believe in and we're doing that.

And as Eric said, quite frankly it took us by surprise and we've got a little bit smarter on how to deal with it. We got smarter in one brand first and quite frankly we raised the shipping fees. There was absolutely no impact to the demand so we've gotten smarter in our other brands as well. In terms of how large it can be, just as we've said in the rest of our Direct-to-consumer business, we're not going to put a limit on it.

We make adjustments for sizes, colors, what have you. With regard to the IMU as we said earlier do I think it's possible for us to have IMU improvement next year, absolutely. Are we going to count on that? Are we going to plan that? Likely not. I think we can have margin improvement but I think the IMUs going to be tough. On the other hand I'm not expecting IMUs to go down.

We historically air freight quite a large percentage of our product. If we need to pull back on that we can and there are other things that we can do. Other efficiencies that we can work on in the supply chain. So I also, I think that there is, hysteria might be too strong a word but I think that everybody's jumping on this bandwagon and I certainly don't want our company to jump on the bandwagon and we're not going to let our suppliers jump on the bandwagon. We have to be smarter and more creative.

The following summarizes our third quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year. Net sales increased 13% to $574 million. Income from operations grew 9% to $105 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18.3%. Net income increased 17% to $73 million or $0.43 per diluted share. 
Comparable Retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, rose 6% with increases of 5%, 29% and 5% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 1%. Direct-to-consumer comparable sales rose 31% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenue increased 13% to $34 million.
Gross profit margins decreased 39 basis points, largely due to higher shipping expenses associated with an increase in international shipments in our Direct-to-consumer channel along with higher occupancy cost due to the timing of increased year-over-year store openings. 
Selling, general and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points to 22.9%. Comparable Retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 8% higher at quarter's end, while comparable retail store inventories increased 1%. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $38 million on a year-over-year basis to $690 million.
I'll now provide more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter, starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $46 million. The company opened 13 new stores in the quarter, five Anthropologie stores, including one accessory and footwear-only store, two Free People stores and six Urban Outfitters stores, including one in Europe, bringing the global store count to 355. Within the quarter, total company comparable store sales were strongest in August followed by October. On a two-year basis, total company comparable store and Retail segment sales improved throughout the quarter, with October being the strongest month. 
By region, sales in Anthropologie and Free People were strongest in the West, and sales in Urban Outfitters were strongest in Continental Europe, followed by the Mid-Atlantic and North America. By store venue, sales at both Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were strongest in lifestyle centers, and sales at Free People were strongest in street locations. For stores, average unit selling prices decreased 2%, while units per transaction and transaction counts each increased 1%. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 32% to $105 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 18.4%, with results largely driven by a 32% increase in website traffic to nearly 30 million visits.
For Retail segment sales, footwear and accessories were strongest at Urban Outfitters and Free People, while women's apparel was strongest at Anthropologie. Wholesale segment sales for the quarter increased 13% to $34 million, driven by a 17% increase at Free People.
I'd now like to turn your attention to gross margin, operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter decreased 39 basis points to 41.1%. The decrease in gross margins was due largely to higher shipping costs associated with an increased penetration of international Direct-to-consumer business, as well as the impact of pre-opening occupancy costs from an additional 11 store openings in the second half of the current year versus the same period last year. Merchandise margins were flat, as the company controlled inventory well throughout the quarter and product cost headwinds were judiciously managed.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter as a percentage of sales increased by 27 basis points, primarily due to investments in systems and our international infrastructure, including pre-opening cost for our new distribution and fulfillment center in Europe. The company's effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter versus 36.1% for the prior comparable quarter. This decrease was due to the favorable impact of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the current-year federal rehabilitation credit and favorable revisions to state tax estimates resulting from tax return filings.
The company generated an impressive 18.3% operating margin, earning a third quarter record of $105 million in income from operations, an increase of 9% versus the same quarter last year. The company also achieved its highest ever net income for a third quarter, $73 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year, with earnings per diluted share of $0.43, a 19% increase over the comparable period last year.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-to-year by $38 million to $690 million at quarter's end. The company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for $133 million during the quarter, leaving 491,533 shares remaining on the current authorization to buy up to a total of 8 million shares.
I'd like to now turn your attention to the fourth quarter. We believe we are well positioned as we head into the holiday season. And while we will not provide specific guidance, it will be helpful for you to consider the following. We began the fourth quarter with an appropriate level of inventory liquidity, providing us the continuing ability to respond to shifting consumer and fashion trends. We are planning for fourth quarter comparable store sales performance to be consistent with third quarter results, coupled with continued strong direct growth.
We project to open 16 new stores in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a sequential improvement in operating margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter similar to last year. However, that result will occur only if we experience positive comparable store sales to leverage occupancy and fixed expenses, as well as continued success in controlling product input costs. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.
As we look forward to fiscal year 2012, we are planning for low single-digit comparable store sales growth, continued strength in our Direct-to-consumer channel and a slight acceleration of our new store opening schedule with a targeted range of 50 to 55 new locations.
Finally, we expect to make continued investments in people, technology and our international expansion, but we'll do so within the confines of our continued goal to grow profits faster than sales. I'll now turn the call back over to Glen."
330706,114935723,88300,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2010",2010-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric. This quarter, as in quarters previous, we have been adapting to a customer who is herself adjusting to the new economy. Today, she expects not just fashion, but compelling design. She expects not just value, but quality. And she expects n",806,"Thank you, Eric. This quarter, as in quarters previous, we have been adapting to a customer who is herself adjusting to the new economy. Today, she expects not just fashion, but compelling design. She expects not just value, but quality. And she expects not just customer service, but a warm, exciting in-store environment and a seamless online experience. On these fronts, assortment, value, operational excellence, customer experience and, of course, brand authenticity, I believe we have continued to outperform.
There's been a considerable amount of discussion around the current fashion shift, which I first referenced during our previous call. Rather than dissect the fashion itself, which I will not do because of competitive factors, let me discuss how we intend to respond to this change, or better put, this opportunity. Fashion cycles are good for our business. We are early adapter merchants selling to early adapter customers. In fact, the ability to recognize change before the market at large has been one of our company's defining competencies, playing a key role in how we've grown our customer base, become a trusted source for fashion and remain relevant throughout our 40-year history. And while it's true that customers may pull back on spending during a period of fashion transition until they're confident with new trends, we have more tools and, I believe, a more rigorous approach to managing these cycles than in years' past. 
What's different? We have our Direct-to-consumer business, which helps us to assess, test and size trends with a quantitative, fact-based approach. We have planning and allocation systems and methodologies, which allow us to control and accurately balance our inventory and on order against trends in the business. And we have our nimble supply chain, where a significantly compressed calendar enables us to adapt to change with ever increasing flexibility and speed. It's these tools that support our goal of navigating through fashion cycles while delivering a relatively consistent financial performance and simultaneously gaining market share.
Let me turn your attention to another topic of much discussion: Sourcing. As I stated on our last call, our team, led by a long-tenured group of professionals, both here and abroad, anticipated much of the change that is occurring. The team made, and will continue to make, appropriate adjustments to our sourcing and logistical strategies, working to optimize every lever in our supply chain. Margin improvement won't be easy or automatic, especially in the short term, but we believe, given the nature of our product, supply chain, partners and process, that we have continued, long-term opportunity for improvement.
Before I finish with our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of our four key growth initiatives: Driving brick-and-mortar productivity, increasing our e-commerce penetration, accelerating international expansion and adding new brands to the URBN portfolio. Since we've spent a considerable amount of time talking about the detail behind each initiative, I'll just provide some highlights today. We're on track with our key systems implementations, including TradeStone, our supply chain management tool; Sterling, the software that will ultimately enable us to have a single inventory across all channels; and Merkle, our consumer insight database. 
We're driving continued gains in e-commerce penetration through the successful execution of a myriad of product, site, fulfillment, social media and mobile strategies. Based on our success in Europe, we're laying the groundwork for a more aggressive expansion through investment and talent, systems and logistics, including our first fulfillment and distribution centers, which will open in summer 2011. We're beginning to plan our entry into the Japanese market, which will likely serve as a gateway to other Asia-Pacific markets. And finally, we're continuing to invest and shape our new brands, Terrain, Leifsdottir and our wedding concept, Beholden.
In closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to the URBN team for an excellent quarter. Our results always are a reflection of the team's dedication, discipline, creativity and skill. No matter the external circumstances, our people adroitly manage that which they can control, and as a result, they're consistent in their deliverance of superior results. Once again, today's record sales and earnings are testament to that capacity. 
We believe that URBN remains one of the true growth stories in Retail, with an opportunity to more than double the North American store count with our existing brands, a best-of-class, rapidly expanding Direct-to-consumer business, a significant opportunity for international growth, a growing portfolio of new concepts to fuel future expansion, and a highly strategic, systematic and controlled approach, which we believe will enable us to continue to grow profits faster than sales. As always, I'd like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the URBN team for their outstanding commitment and to our shareholders for their continued support. I will now open the call for questions. And as is our custom, we will limit the queries to one per caller."

And in our prepared comments, I was pointed in talking about not only the people who work for us in North America, but also our buying offices, our agents and the factories themselves. We've been in business with these people a long time. They're our partners, and we're working through this together. 
The group has done a myriad of things. First of all, we're dual sourced in many, many product categories. We have a lower percentage of exposure in China than I believe most of our peer group does. It's important to remember that the raw materials comprise the lower part of our COGS than most of our peer group. Cotton, for example, when a typical product that we sell is less than 10% of the cost. 
It's also important to remember that we're not in low-cost factories for the most part. Our products have a lot of make in them, and we tend to be in factories that have higher-than-average wages and therefore, they're less sensitive to the wage changes. We're also, quite frankly, there's a lot more design in most of the product that we sell, so I think there's less price sensitivity, particularly if we're into a fashion change earlier like I believe we are right now. So as I said in our prepared remarks, it's not easy. There's a lot of headwinds. We don't expect a lot of improvement in the short term, but we expect continued improvements."

But the brands, we're not a company where we have the best seller in one brand. I take a sample and I run into another brand's building.

So certainly, Steve at Urban, Wendy at Anthropologie, Meg at Free People, they're aware of what's going on at the other brands. And if there's the kind of positive trend that there is at Free People, everybody's going to be paying attention to it. 
With regard to Direct-to-consumer, it's always easier for us to manipulate the website and kind of get to the best products, best message almost immediately. If we have a $1 million of inventory in a store, if we absolutely love half of that inventory and we kind of, we're just lukewarm on the other half, we still have to deal with that other half over a six- to eight-week period. Online, we can make it look as if we love everything that we're selling and we can manipulate the visual execution so that we downplay what we don't love. And it's easier for us to project a more relevant, more compelling message online. So that's really the difference. And in terms of you and the rest of the group on the call, I would encourage you to go to our website. And as I always say, if it's at regular price and it's front and forward, it's good. If it's been marked down recently or is in the back of the store or the back of the website, it's not so good."

I do feel like the merchant teams have clarity as to what's working, so I think that it's easier for them to pick good product or design good product today than it was three or six months ago on a go-forward basis."

The following summarizes our third quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year. Net sales increased 13% to $574 million. Income from operations grew 9% to $105 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18.3%",1007,"Thank you, Glen. The following summarizes our third quarter fiscal 2011 performance versus the comparable quarter last year. Net sales increased 13% to $574 million. Income from operations grew 9% to $105 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18.3%. Net income increased 17% to $73 million or $0.43 per diluted share.
Comparable Retail segment sales, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, rose 6% with increases of 5%, 29% and 5% at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Total company comparable store sales increased 1%. Direct-to-consumer comparable sales rose 31% with all three brands posting double-digit increases. Wholesale revenue increased 13% to $34 million.
Gross profit margins decreased 39 basis points, largely due to higher shipping expenses associated with an increase in international shipments in our Direct-to-consumer channel along with higher occupancy cost due to the timing of increased year-over-year store openings.
Selling, general and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points to 22.9%. Comparable Retail segment inventories, which include our Direct-to-consumer channel, were 8% higher at quarter's end, while comparable retail store inventories increased 1%. Finally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew by $38 million on a year-over-year basis to $690 million.
I'll now provide more detail on each of our key business metrics for the quarter, starting with sales. New and non-comparable store sales contributed $46 million. The company opened 13 new stores in the quarter, five Anthropologie stores, including one accessory and footwear-only store, two Free People stores and six Urban Outfitters stores, including one in Europe, bringing the global store count to 355. Within the quarter, total company comparable store sales were strongest in August followed by October. On a two-year basis, total company comparable store and Retail segment sales improved throughout the quarter, with October being the strongest month.
By region, sales in Anthropologie and Free People were strongest in the West, and sales in Urban Outfitters were strongest in Continental Europe, followed by the Mid-Atlantic and North America. By store venue, sales at both Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters were strongest in lifestyle centers, and sales at Free People were strongest in street locations. For stores, average unit selling prices decreased 2%, while units per transaction and transaction counts each increased 1%. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 32% to $105 million. The penetration of Direct-to-consumer sales to net sales as a whole increased more than two percentage points to 18.4%, with results largely driven by a 32% increase in website traffic to nearly 30 million visits.
For Retail segment sales, footwear and accessories were strongest at Urban Outfitters and Free People, while women's apparel was strongest at Anthropologie. Wholesale segment sales for the quarter increased 13% to $34 million, driven by a 17% increase at Free People.
I'd now like to turn your attention to gross margin, operating expense and income. Gross margins for the quarter decreased 39 basis points to 41.1%. The decrease in gross margins was due largely to higher shipping costs associated with an increased penetration of international Direct-to-consumer business, as well as the impact of pre-opening occupancy costs from an additional 11 store openings in the second half of the current year versus the same period last year. Merchandise margins were flat, as the company controlled inventory well throughout the quarter and product cost headwinds were judiciously managed.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter as a percentage of sales increased by 27 basis points, primarily due to investments in systems and our international infrastructure, including pre-opening cost for our new distribution and fulfillment center in Europe. The company's effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter versus 36.1% for the prior comparable quarter. This decrease was due to the favorable impact of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the current-year federal rehabilitation credit and favorable revisions to state tax estimates resulting from tax return filings.
The company generated an impressive 18.3% operating margin, earning a third quarter record of $105 million in income from operations, an increase of 9% versus the same quarter last year. The company also achieved its highest ever net income for a third quarter, $73 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year, with earnings per diluted share of $0.43, a 19% increase over the comparable period last year.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew year-to-year by $38 million to $690 million at quarter's end. The company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for $133 million during the quarter, leaving 491,533 shares remaining on the current authorization to buy up to a total of 8 million shares.
I'd like to now turn your attention to the fourth quarter. We believe we are well positioned as we head into the holiday season. And while we will not provide specific guidance, it will be helpful for you to consider the following. We began the fourth quarter with an appropriate level of inventory liquidity, providing us the continuing ability to respond to shifting consumer and fashion trends. We are planning for fourth quarter comparable store sales performance to be consistent with third quarter results, coupled with continued strong direct growth.
We project to open 16 new stores in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a sequential improvement in operating margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter similar to last year. However, that result will occur only if we experience positive comparable store sales to leverage occupancy and fixed expenses, as well as continued success in controlling product input costs. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.
As we look forward to fiscal year 2012, we are planning for low single-digit comparable store sales growth, continued strength in our Direct-to-consumer channel and a slight acceleration of our new store opening schedule with a targeted range of 50 to 55 new locations.
Finally, we expect to make continued investments in people, technology and our international expansion, but we'll do so within the confines of our continued goal to grow profits faster than sales.
I'll now turn the call back over to Glen."

Rather than dissect the fashion itself, which I will not do because of competitive factors, let me discuss how we intend to respond to this change, or better put, this opportunity. Fashion cycles are good for our business. We are early adapter merchants selling to early adapter customers. In fact, the ability to recognize change before the market at large has been one of our company's defining competencies, playing a key role in how we've grown our customer base, become a trusted source for fashion and remain relevant throughout our 40-year history. And while it's true that customers may pull back on spending during a period of fashion transition until they're confident with new trends, we have more tools and, I believe, a more rigorous approach to managing these cycles than in years' past.
What's different? We have our Direct-to-consumer business, which helps us to assess, test and size trends with a quantitative, fact-based approach. We have planning and allocation systems and methodologies, which allow us to control and accurately balance our inventory and on order against trends in the business. And we have our nimble supply chain, where a significantly compressed calendar enables us to adapt to change with ever increasing flexibility and speed. It's these tools that support our goal of navigating through fashion cycles while delivering a relatively consistent financial performance and simultaneously gaining market share.
Let me turn your attention to another topic of much discussion: Sourcing. As I stated on our last call, our team, led by a long-tenured group of professionals, both here and abroad, anticipated much of the change that is occurring. The team made, and will continue to make, appropriate adjustments to our sourcing and logistical strategies, working to optimize every lever in our supply chain. Margin improvement won't be easy or automatic, especially in the short term, but we believe, given the nature of our product, supply chain, partners and process that we have continued, long-term opportunity for improvement.
Before I finish with our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of our four key growth initiatives: Driving brick-and-mortar productivity, increasing our e-commerce penetration, accelerating international expansion and adding new brands to the URBN portfolio. Since we've spent a considerable amount of time talking about the detail behind each initiative, I'll just provide some highlights today. We're on track with our key systems implementations, including TradeStone, our supply chain management tool; Sterling, the software that will ultimately enable us to have a single inventory across all channels; and Merkle, our consumer insight database.
We're driving continued gains in e-commerce penetration through the successful execution of a myriad of product, site, fulfillment, social media and mobile strategies. Based on our success in Europe, we're laying the groundwork for a more aggressive expansion through investment and talent, systems and logistics, including our first fulfillment and distribution centers, which will open in summer 2011. We're beginning to plan our entry into the Japanese market, which will likely serve as a gateway to other Asia-Pacific markets. And finally, we're continuing to invest and shape our new brands, Terrain, Leifsdottir and our wedding concept, Beholden.
In closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to the URBN team for an excellent quarter. Our results always are a reflection of the team's dedication, discipline, creativity and skill. No matter the external circumstances, our people adroitly manage that which they can control, and as a result, they're consistent in their deliverance of superior results. Once again, today's record sales and earnings are testament to that capacity.
We believe that URBN remains one of the true growth stories in Retail, with an opportunity to more than double the North American store count with our existing brands, a best-of-class, rapidly expanding Direct-to-consumer business, a significant opportunity for international growth, a growing portfolio of new concepts to fuel future expansion, and a highly strategic, systematic and controlled approach, which we believe will enable us to continue to grow profits faster than sales. As always, I'd like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the URBN team for their outstanding commitment and to our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now open the call for questions. And as is our custom, we will limit the queries to one per caller."

We've been in business with these people a long time. They're our partners, and we're working through this together.
The group has done a myriad of things. First of all, we're dual sourced in many, many product categories. We have a lower percentage of exposure in China than I believe most of our peer group does. It's important to remember that the raw materials comprise the lower part of our COGS than most of our peer group. Cotton, for example, when a typical product that we sell is less than 10% of the cost.
It's also important to remember that we're not in low-cost factories for the most part. Our products have a lot of make in them, and we tend to be in factories that have higher-than-average wages and therefore, they're less sensitive to the wage changes. We also, quite frankly, there's a lot more design in most of the product that we sell, so I think there's less price sensitivity, particularly if we're into a fashion change earlier like I believe we are right now.

And if there's the kind of positive trend that there is at Free People, everybody's going to be paying attention to it.
With regard to Direct-to-consumer, it's always easier for us to manipulate the website and kind of get to the best products, best message almost immediately. If we have a $1 million of inventory in a store, if we absolutely love half of that inventory and we kind of, we're just lukewarm on the other half, we still have to deal with that other half over a six- to eight-week period. Online, we can make it look as if we love everything that we're selling and we can manipulate the visual execution so that we downplay what we don't love. And it's just easier for us to project a more relevant, more compelling message online. So that's really the difference. And in terms of you and the rest of the group on the call, I would encourage you to go to our website. And as I always say, if it's at regular price and it's front and forward, it's good. If it's been marked down recently or is in the back of the store or the back of the website, it's not so good."

So also, I think that there is, hysteria might be too strong a word, but I think that everybody's jumping on this bandwagon, and I certainly don't want our company to jump on the bandwagon. We're not going to let our suppliers jump on the bandwagon. We have to be smarter and more creative."

I will tell you that the marketing managers in the brands are thrilled to have the information. I will tell you that the circulation that we managed using this new customer site database was significantly more productive than the circulation we planned with our outside service. So there's a lot of rich data. Like everything we do, we're going to be very methodical, iterative, evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary, so I don't expect to wake up tomorrow and see huge increases. I think it's one of the more powerful things that this company has done in quite some time, and I think it will reap benefits for years to come."

And really, you're going to see is bid towards metro centers, of which the Fifth Avenue store is obviously one, and the traditional malls. And we've delivered a ratio that we think is more or less in keeping with our existing fleet, but there's the two most important segments within the portfolio.

We intend to sell special occasion dresses, decorations, invitations, and the site and the store will also have quite a bit of content.
