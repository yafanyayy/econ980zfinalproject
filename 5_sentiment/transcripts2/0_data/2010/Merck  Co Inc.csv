And welcome to the 2009 Fourth Quarter Conference Call for the new Merck. This is our first quarter of combined operations, so there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as gains associated with the controlling interest in the cholesterol [ph] (00:12:00) joint venture, purchase accounting adjustments, there are merger-related expenses and also restructuring costs. And so as a result of having those many items, we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, so that you can get a better sense of the underlying performance of our business. Also, since the merger was completed on November 3, the GAAP quarterly results only include two months of combined operations. So we have also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends as well. So in the press release there are five tables. Table 1 is the GAAP results. Table 2 and 3 reconcile our GAAP P&L to our non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter and also for the full year 2009. Table 4 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products, as if the company had been combined for the full year and also for the full fourth quarter of 2009. Table 5 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides sales for the major products and businesses, as if the company had been combined in 2008. That will help you make some growth comparisons in the 2009 period. During the call, we will be referring to Tables 2 and 3 when we discuss the P&L, and Table 4 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those tables available. In addition, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties. The company's SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2008 10-K, identifies certain factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. You can find our SEC filings, as well as today's earnings release and tables, on merck.com.This morning, I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman, President and CEO; Ken Frazier, the President of our Global Human Health business; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dick Clark."

It was a little less than a year ago last March when we announced our plan to merge Merck and Schering-Plough. At the time, I told you that the combination made great strategic and financial sense and held exceptional promise, thanks to our stronger pipeline, more diverse product offerings across our broader range of businesses and an expanded global reach. In other words, our merger was and is about science and the increased relevance we now have to our customers. While this merger is about more than just cost, we stand firmly behind the financial targets we set last March. Today, we are pleased to report solid fourth quarter and full year 2009 results for the combined company. These results demonstrate the strong business focus each company maintained last year. That is a significant accomplishment, considering that the results were achieved in the midst of uncertain global economy, an ever-shifting healthcare landscape, extensive merger planning and then the start of integration once the merger was completed. In terms of top line, the company had sales of $10.1 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 revenue are $27.4 billion. The combined company had fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 and GAAP earnings per share of $2.35. Full year 2009 non-GAAP earnings were $3.25 per share, which excludes certain items in GAAP earnings of $5.65.  Our fourth quarter results were driven in part by the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough sales in our results, as well as the strong sales from JANUVIA, SINGULAIR and ISENTRESS. Peter Kellogg will provide you further financial details, as well as some thoughts on our outlook for the future.Since the merger closed in early November, we have moved quickly around the world to integrate our operations and begin taking advantage of the opportunities that come with the new Merck. Thus far, we are quite pleased with the pace of our progress in adopting best practices from each company, integrating the commercial organizations, planning our network strategy and consolidating the pipeline. In fact, since the merger's completion, our combined pipeline has been a top priority. I spend a considerable amount of time with Peter Kim and other senior Merck leaders to conduct a thorough review of the new combined pipeline, so we may better prioritize our efforts by franchise, phase, cost and geographic importance. I'm very enthusiastic about the work we've done on our powerful R&D pipeline, with more than 20 late-stage programs. We look forward to talking with you about that soon. By advancing the highest potential pipeline candidates, accelerating product development and launches and maximizing the value of our medicines to full life-cycle management, we're focused on driving sustained innovation and revenue growth. We see three ways of new product opportunities over the near and long term the should contribute to our growth. Wave one is happening now, with products that are already in launch mode, such as SIMPONI, SAPHRIS and JANUVIA in Japan. Wave two focuses on near-term approvals. Just in the last few weeks, we had two key approvals, BRIDION and ELONVA. And we have four other key products on review as we speak. Wave three highlights our long-stage pipeline opportunities, which we believe are the best in the industry. Our strategy also includes continuing to tap into external sources of innovation to complement the work that is underway in our labs. We completed 51 licensing deals in 2009, with more to come this year; all of which could further our shareholder value.On the commercial side, we are building our capabilities and growth potential in vaccines, biologics and emerging markets. And they are sources of real focus and excitement within the new Merck. We are working hard on the strategies that will advance us to the next level in each of these growth areas. Here's a recent example. The acquisition of Avecia Biologics will allow Merck to build upon the biological expertise and manufacturing capability acquired during the past three decades at Schering-Plough. The new Merck's healthy and diversified product portfolio includes offerings from A-Z in a wide range of therapeutic areas from animal health to women's health. Each of our top 10 selling brands from our expanded product portfolio exceeds $1 billion in annual sales in 2009. In a few moments, Ken will talk about the performance of our key brands and how we're positioned the company's full portfolio of healthcare offerings for near term and future growth.Since late last year, we filled up the senior ranks of our new company with the best executives from both companies, as well as respected leaders with new capabilities and external experience. We're proud to welcome two new vaccine leaders: Former CDC Director, Dr. Julie Gerberding, as the leader of our Vaccine franchise; and Dr. Michael Kamarck, previously President at Product Supply at Wyeth, will lead Vaccines and Biologics manufacturing. We're also pleased to welcome to Merck Executive Committee former Dean of Tufts School of Medicine, Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, as Merck's new Chief Medical Officer; and Bridgette Heller, as the head of our Consumer Health Care business. Moving forward, we must realize the enormous value of our merger for patients, customers and shareholders. That includes gaining the benefit of fully integrating all aspects of the two formerly separate companies.We remain absolutely committed to our previously announced target of realizing merger synergies of $3.5 billion in annual savings in 2012. As part of these plans, we unveiled today a new multiphase global restructuring program designed to integrate and further optimize our operations and cost structure to support the more nimble, customer-focused and diversified healthcare leader Merck is becoming. We expect to complete the first phase of the program we announced today by the end of 2012. Additional phases of the merger restructuring program are expected to be announced later this year. We also expect to realize our savings through priority initiatives in areas, such as procurement. Building on earlier work begun in 2005, we're making progress in putting in place a best-in-industry cost structure. It will take time before we fully integrate off the access [ph] (00:21:15) of the two companies. The restructuring and integration process is complex, and includes changes that require our hard choices and difficult decisions, especially those that affect our colleagues throughout workforce reductions. But as we said all along, the majority of our colleagues from both legacy companies will be part of the new Merck going forward. Looking ahead into 2010 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about our goal in becoming the best healthcare company in the world. We continue to be committed to our long-term financial targets. But the real value driver of our merger will be science and innovation, because Merck's long-term strength will come from our ability to develop critical medicines and vaccines. What will set this merger apart is not just the what but the how, the clarity of our vision, our ability to hit the ground running and the thoughtfulness, which we will manage through the integration of our businesses, our operations and our people. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken."

As a newly combi",1830,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we drove solid performance across the Global Human Health portfolio, thanks to the strong growth of many of our key brands in markets around the world. As a newly combined company, we were off to a great start following the merger, and we will continue to focus on driving top line performance in 2010, especially for our new and faster growing brands. Overall, Global Human Health delivered a solid quarter, with recorded sales of $9.1 billion. When you would include all three months of Schering-Plough sales, our non-GAAP sales were $10.8 billion, which represents 9% growth from the previous year. The growth was broad-based, with eight of our top 10 product families growing in the fourth quarter. These eight franchises accounted for more than half of total sales, and grew a combined 15% over the previous year. We drove this growth across a diverse base of markets. Sales outside the U.S. increased by 13%,  which includes the favorable impact of foreign exchange. And inside the U.S., we generated growth of 3% compared to the previous year. In the U.S., sales in the fourth quarter were aided by approximately $100 million of wholesaler inventory buy-in, stockpile purchases of certain vaccines by the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the initial stocking for the SAPHRIS launch. Overall, I believe our fourth quarter performance is a good indicator that we are maintaining strong focus and momentum, while we integrate our teams. Before I discuss the performance of individual brands, I want to update you on the progress we have made since the completion of the merger. We will be integrating our businesses in markets around the world at different times, taking local considerations into account. As we do so, we will be leveraging the new commercial models that we had already implemented in nearly 30 markets.In the U.S., our experience with implementing Merck's new commercial model over the past two years prepared us to make critical staffing decisions quickly, with three very specific goals in mind: Retaining top talent, maintaining business momentum and minimizing disruption to our customers. In fact, by late January, we've completed the design and blending process to stand up the entire U.S. sales organization. Our U.S. sales force is now fully operational and completely focused on meeting customer needs. Our broader primary care offerings are ideally suited to the portfolio-based selling approach of the new commercial model, because the merger enables us to be more relevant to our customers across key franchises, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, women's health and other franchises.I want to emphasize one additional point about our integration efforts. While we focus on delivering the synergies that the merger creates, we are also making conscious, explicit decisions to invest to grow our business. So while we are reducing the size and cost of our commercial operations in more developed markets like the U.S., we are also making resource allocation decisions to grow our presence in major emerging markets. In fact, despite the economic volatility that we saw in these markets, our business grew by double digits in key emerging markets, like China and Brazil, during the fourth quarter.Also, as we indicated on the third quarter call, we made strategic investments to maintain and grow our key in-line growth drivers through additional promotional spending in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to do so this year. For JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR, for example, we made strategic investments in the fourth quarter to grow these brands. We also invested in our new product launches this quarter. These investments contributed to strong top line performance for many of our key brands. Now as I turn to individual product performance, I'll refer you to Table 4 from our supplemental financial package provided with our press release, so you can follow along. Starting with SINGULAIR, sales in the fourth quarter were $1.3 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. We saw double-digit growth in key markets, including the U.S., where we grew by 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Moving to JANUVIA and JANUMET, global revenue grew to a combined $760 million in the fourth quarter, up 43% versus the prior year. Now in the fourth year since its launch, we continue to drive strong performance for the JANUVIA/JANUMET franchise in markets around the world. JANUVIA and JANUMET remain the most prescribed products in the DPP-4 [dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor] class. We continue to invest in JANUVIA and JANUMET to maintain our leadership position in the diabetes markets and to grow this franchise. In the U.S., where we have recently seen the first DPP-4 competitor, we generated 24% growth versus fourth quarter 2008. We believe we can grow the franchise by taking share from the sulfonylureas as second-line treatment for appropriate patients. In addition, we are continuing our coupon program, which has been a success today.In the EU, we also have a labeling advantage. JANUVIA is the only DPP-4 approved for restricted first-line use and for use as an add-on to insulin. In Japan, which is a fast-growing oral diabetes market, we are in early stages of the JANUVIA launch. JANUVIA has an extremely strong value proposition, and is being reimbursed at a premium price to ACTOS. Despite Japan's practice of limiting new medicines to only a two-week patient supply in the first year, the initial tracking shows that the JANUVIA launch is going very well. We are building this franchise for the long term, indication-by-indication and country-by-country. We've submitted three sNDAs [supplemental New Drug Application] for sitagliptin in the U.S. to allow use with insulin, which would make sitagliptin the only DPP-4 approved for use with insulin, for initial use with pioglitazone and for use as add-on therapy with PPAR [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor] agonists and metformin. As you can see, there are many reasons why we expect that this franchise will continue to be a growth driver for Merck. I'd like to REMICADE and our newly launched biologic SIMPONI. We believe REMICADE and SIMPONI offer two great options for patients: REMICADE for rapidly progressing RA [rheumatoid arthritis] patients; and SIMPONI, the only once-monthly subcutaneous anti-TNF [tumor necrosis factor] available in the EU. In our first quarter combined operations, REMICADE delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth and reached a new quarterly high, with sales of $635 million, an increase of 29% over last year. The growth was broad-based, as we saw increased utilization across all six indications. We're maintaining our market share in rheumatoid arthritis despite new entrance to the market, and we continue to see solid performance and growth from the gastro indications, especially ulcerative colitis. For SIMPONI, we now have launched in five countries. To date, we have full reimbursement in Germany and Denmark. We plan to launch in many of the other large EU markets in the second half of 2010, as we gain reimbursement for SIMPONI from both public and private payers. In infectious disease, ISENTRESS continues to perform well and had another quarter of strong growth. Sales in the fourth quarter were $234 million, up 80% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and safety profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations.  ISENTRESS has become the new benchmark for an HIV launch and with the new treatment-naive indication, ISENTRESS is now approved for use across each stage in the treatment continuum.Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN, sales were $1.2 billion this quarter, which represents 6% growth compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by a 10% increase in the sales of ZETIA. For the franchise, sales in the U.S. declined 5%. However, this was more than offset by the strong growth of the brand outside the U.S., where the two brands grew by 23%, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange.The unique value proposition for these brands remains strong. And we continue to see growth opportunities in many markets around the world. I will now move two our Vaccine business, starting with GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the fourth quarter were $277 million, a 3% decline when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., we had about $70 million of favorability due mostly to a CDC stockpile purchase. Keep this in mind, as you model GARDASIL sales in subsequent quarters. X U.S. sales of GARDASIL as reported by Merck decreased 15%, attributable to the high-penetration rate and impact of large orders in 2008 in early-adopting countries, such as Mexico, Canada and Australia. Globally, we continue to outperform the competition, achieving an x U.S. market share of 77% in dollar terms in the fourth quarter and a global share of 87%.Sales of ProQuad, M-M-R II and VARIVAX combined increased 13% in the fourth quarter due to a CDC stockpile purchase of $64 million. If you exclude this favorability, sales would have decreased 9% year-over-year, largely due to the saturation in the varicella second dose catch-up cohort.Now moving to ZOSTAVAX, fourth quarter sales as reported by Merck were $76 million, down 53% from the previous year, largely due to the release of a very significant number of back orders in the fourth quarter of 2008. While we anticipate that ZOSTAVAX this will be available in 2010 in the U.S., customers may experience back orders throughout this year. International launches of ZOSTAVAX will be delayed until 2011. Now, I'd like to make a few comments about COZAAR/HYZAAR, which grew 8% year-over-year. As you know, COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in early April, and COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose exclusivity at most major EU markets in the first quarter of 2010. In the U.S., we anticipate that multisource generics will be available immediately following the patent expiry, which we believe will lead to rapid erosion of sales from the current levels. And because internationally rose in [ph] (00:35:05) rates have accelerated in recent years, we expect that the generic uptake in the EU will also be rapid.As we head further into 2010, I want to share with you how we are prioritizing our work in GHH, Global Human Health. First, we are focused on driving in-line brand performance and we will continue to make the necessary investments to grow as we integrate our operations. Second, we are focused on the launches of our new products. In addition to SIMPONI, which I mentioned previously, we have recently put more promotional resources behind the SAPHRIS launch in the U.S. Other opportunities we have this year in markets around the world include the launches of SAFLUTAN, TREDAPTIVE, ELONVA and BRIDION. Finally, while we focus on these opportunities, we are also creating a leaner, even more customer-focused organization that builds on the best of the Merck and Schering-Plough commercial organizations. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progresses. And now, it's my pleasure to pass it over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First,",2235,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First, I will cover what is included in our results. Second, I will provide an update on our fourth quarter performance. And third, I will comment on our outlook for 2010. So let's go to the results.We recognize that there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. The merger closed in the middle of the quarter and therefore, there are only two months of Schering-Plough included in the results. Our results also included the add-in complexity of purchase price accounting adjustments and restructuring charges, and the joint venture that is being unwound and reported in the combined company's results rather than in equity income. As Alex discussed in the opening, we included new tables in our press release and supplemental charts to help you navigate through the accounting. To make it easier for you to follow, I will speak mostly to the non-GAAP results in our remarks.Our non-GAAP results exclude restructuring costs, purchase price accounting adjustments, which included a $7.5 billion gain on the step-up of Merck's share in the MSP [Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals] partnership to current market value; merger-related costs; and a $400 million gain related to the sale of Merial in the quarter. On this basis, the new Merck reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. There are a number of factors that are reflected in our performance this quarter. First, we drove operational sales growth in many markets around the world, in part through higher promotional spending in support of our key brands and new launches. Second, we continued investing in our strong late-stage pipeline. Third, we had lower equity income from partnerships. And finally, we benefited from a lower combined company tax rate. In addition, as a result of the merger financing, our interest expense is higher and our interest income lower. And the number of common shares outstanding has substantially increased.Let's get into some of the individual items beginning with revenue. Total revenue for the quarter, as reported by Merck, was $10.1 billion, with about a 1% benefit from foreign exchange. On a supplemental-combined non-GAAP basis, which assumes Schering-Plough was included for all three months of the quarter in 2009 and 2008, sales were $12.2 billion, up 7%. You can see this in Table 4 provided today in our financial supplement.Ken just walked through the Human Health business results, so let me touch for a moment on our Animal and Consumer Health businesses. Animal Health sales totaled $759 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting continued growth among companion animal and poultry products. Consumer Health Care sales were $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting solid demand for OTC CLARITIN and foot care products.Now moving on to the expense items on the P&L. First, let's look at materials and production. The gross margin in the fourth quarter was approximately 74% versus 76% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline is primarily attributed to the inclusion of results from Schering-Plough, which has historically had a lower gross margin due to some major partnerships. Foreign exchange also had an unfavorable impact on the gross margin from Schering-Plough. Turning to marketing and administrative costs, M&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The majority of the increase over the fourth quarter of 2008 is attributable to the addition of Schering-Plough expenses and inclusion of the expenses from the Merck/Schering-Plough JV in the P&L and the impact of foreign exchange. Additionally, as we had anticipated, Merck had higher marketing expenses during the fourth quarter than in the first three quarters of 2009. We increased promotion in support of our key brands, and we are also investing to ensure the success of our new launches around the globe, including JANUVIA in Japan and TREDAPTIVE in the EU.As Ken mentioned, we have a number of launches in major markets underway today. And we have more on the way. We want to ensure the success of these launches by supporting them with the right level of promotion in 2010. Now let's turn to R&D. Research and development expenses for the new Merck and the fourth quarter where approximately $2 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D spending is up approximately $700 million this quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the addition of Schering-Plough R&D costs and the continued investment in late-stage opportunities such as TRA, boceprevir, demicative [ph], CORDAPTIVE, in our CETP inhibitor. Now let's move to equity income. In the fourth quarter, Merck recorded $374 million of equity income, a decline of $346 million over the prior year. The decline is attributable to three factors which you can derive from Table 6 in the financial supplement.  First, equity income in the quarter includes only one month of results from the MSP joint venture versus three months in the prior year. Post-closing of the merger, these results are reflected in sales and expenses of the new Merck. Second, a $75 million decline in the income from the AZLP joint ventures due to the timing variability of payments from AZLP. And third, the sale of Merial to our partner sanofi in the third quarter.Now let's talk about other income and expense. For the fourth quarter of 2009, other expense on a non-GAAP basis is $92 million compared to other income of $27 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. There are a few items driving this year-over-year change. First, most notable is the inclusion of interest expense from the Schering-Plough debt and the merger-related debt post closing. Second, interest income of $11 million was $137 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances.  Third, in the same quarter of last year, Merck recognized $74 million of exchange losses which did not recur this quarter. That helped to offset a portion of the negative interest expense and interest income comparisons. Now let's turn to the tax rate.  The new Merck non-GAAP tax rate is 15% for the fourth quarter. This reflects two dynamics. First, on the Merck side, there was some one-time benefits that aren't likely to recur. Second, we had the benefit related to the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough during the two-month sub-period. And this sub-period had a much lower tax rate than legacy Merck.  For 2010, we don't anticipate a significant change in the rate that we saw in 2009 on a full year basis excluding discreet items. Our full year 2009 rate was approximately 23% when you exclude discreet items in the first and second quarters.Okay, so that's the fourth quarter. As you can see, there a lot of moving parts. Here's how I think about our performance this quarter. We had strong growth in sales of our key brands. At the same time, we continued investment in the future success of our newest products and our late-stage pipeline. So overall, a solid start to the new Merck. Now let's talk about where we're going beginning with 2010.  As we already indicated, we'll provide 2010 financial guidance around the timing of our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'd like to provide you with some perspective that I believe will be helpful. As we step back and look at new Merck, we are pleased with our many opportunities ahead. We continue to target a high single digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 for the combined company when compared to Merck 2009 non-GAAP EPS.  Looking ahead over this next four-year period, we do anticipate that some years will be stronger than others. For example, 2010 has several factors that will be challenging. During 2010, we will begin to realize synergies from the merger. However, we also face the loss of patent protection for COZAAR/HYZAAR and TEMODAR, products that contribute $3.1 billion of revenues in the Europe U.S. last year. And we will continue to invest in launched brands.So as we think about 2010, there are four areas that I'd like to specifically call to your attention. First, let's start with the sales line. The merger has improved our longer term patent position and we are launching many new products like SAPHRIS and SIMPONI. However, we do faced significant patent losses in 2010. The biggest is COZAAR/HYZAAR. So how should you think about that in 2010? Well, first, in the first quarter, we expect to pullback in the COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventory levels to below-normal levels as the patent expiry date approaches. Second, as Ken mentioned, we believe that the erosion rate will be fast as multiple generics enter the market after the patent expires. The second 2010 patent issue were not as large as TEMODAR, one of our high-margin products. In the U.S., we were disappointed by the recent District Court judgment and then filed an appeal in a motion for a preliminary injunction to allow the Court time to hear our appeal. In addition, TEMODAR lost patent protection in Europe in 2009 and we expect continued erosion. Despite the impressive number of new product launches in 2010, they will not be able to compensate for these two patent losses.Now second, let's talk abut synergies. We are committed to a merger-related cost synergies of $3.5 billion annually in 2012. The first phase of our Merger Restructuring Program that Dick told you about is expected to contribute $2.6 billion to $3 billion to this annual target. As we said, additional phases will be announced by the end of 2010.  We expect to see significant synergies, mostly on the M&A line in 2010. As a result, we expect the M&A line to be down on a full year basis in 2010 versus what the two companies spent individually in 2009. Please keep in mind that these synergies build over time. Very importantly, we expect the synergies in 2010 to be back-end loaded with about two-thirds of the synergies coming in the second half of the year. This will cause the shape of the earnings curve during 2010 to be quite back-end loaded.Now let's talk about the third area which is R&D where we have two dynamics underway. On the one hand, we are investing in our late-stage pipeline. On the other hand, we're driving efficiencies through the combined R&D infrastructure. Coming into the merger, Schering-Plough and Merck each had strong and growing R&D pipelines. And on a stand-alone basis, each company expected to significantly increase its level of R&D investment in 2010 due to the richness of its late-stage pipeline and the many ongoing large outcomes trials.Let me give you a sense of scale. In cardiovascular disease alone, we had more than 80,000 patients currently in our clinical trials. And that number is expected to grow to more than 100,000 patients before those trials end. So therefore, based on this level of Phase III project activity, we expect that the level of R&D investments in 2010 will be similar to slightly higher than levels seen in 2009 for both companies on a combined basis. We believe that making these 2010 investments are the best way to drive shareholder value. Lastly, let's talk about the timing of certain items this year. There are a number of items that will affect the early part of the year and specifically Q1. First, Q1 is typically the softest quarter of the year due to the seasonality of our respiratory and vaccine franchises. We saw this in the first quarter of 2009. Second, we have the expected pull down in COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventories in Q1 that I mentioned earlier. Third, there was approximately $135 million of favorable vaccine revenue in Q4 primarily due to a number of CDC stockpile purchases, and these will not recur in the first quarter.  Fourth, we had a low tax rate in the fourth quarter that we do not expect to recur this year. Also, aside from the seasonality, these items relate to Q1 but obviously, they want a similar impact on the full year results. So let me summarize. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that non-GAAP earnings in the second half of 2010 will be considerably higher than non-GAAP earnings in the first half of 2010 due to the phasing in of synergies. In fact, we believe our non-GAAP EPS run rate in the second half of this year will provide strong evidence that we are heading towards our long-term EPS goal. We are on track to have a good first full year as a combined company. We will continue our business momentum for key brands and launch products. We remain very excited about the future of the new Merck. And we continue to target high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate in 2009 to 2013 for the combined company.  As Dick emphasized, this is a company that will build its long-term strength through science and innovation. We look forward to speaking with you about the products, the pipeline and the strategy of the new Merck during our second quarter R&D and business update meeting. Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Alex. Alex?"

Secondly, we haven't really given R&D launch some guidance yet. And obviously, that's something we'll do when we get out towards the first quarter earnings call. But I do want to remind everybody that our long-term perspective on the company is that we will have high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth over the time period that we talked about. And that we are going to see a nice pretax margin improvement as we go from today to that time frame. We highlighted on the time of  merger that we are shooting something that begins to approach the 40% level. It's obviously based on the current expectations on what we know at this point. But that implies there will be productivity in all the lines as we go through the P&L and that will be something you'll be seeing particularly, as all the different integration steps are going on in our R&D organizations come to bear. But I do think, as Dick said, in the beginning, this is about science and innovation and global expansion and having really world-class organizations in every function. And so we are going to be making sure that we make the right investments in all areas and yet still drive great productivity throughout the company."

We have some nice gains from a hedging position that we had. That moderates the year-over-year benefit. But net-net, what I can say is the EPS benefit on the bottom line is moderately better than what you see on the top line but not really dramatic. So really in some ways, it's probably net-net foreign exchange didn't benefit from our P&L on the fourth quarter versus last year, as much in part of that is because we had a nice hedging program that made the prior year stand up a little better."

And all I know that I can say about the Gilead pill is obviously, we're talking about an experimental pill with an anticipated launch that's many years away. We said earlier in the U.S. that we did see some wholesalers stocking this quarter. I think we view that as being reasonable in terms of comparing the fourth quarter '09 to the fourth quarter '08, although it was up from the third quarter of '09. And your general question about marketing expenditures, I can just summarize by saying, we continue to put money behind our growth drivers. We're very pleased, for example, with the recent trends around JANUVIA. We mentioned before that we were really going to focus on JANUVIA before we had put the focus on messaging, the importance of maximizing BBP IV inhibition, to try to blog [ph] the introduction of in-class competition, we've expanded our approach. We've now started to focus on the ability to work competitively against so far in areas and we have been encouraged by the focus and the resources that put behind JANUVIA in terms of the increased volumes in December and January. So we continue to view JANUVIA and JANUMET as well as some of our other in-line products as key growth drivers in the U.S. market and beyond."

This is our first quarter of combined operations, so there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as gains associated with the controlling interest in the cholesterol joint venture, purchase accounting adjustments, there are merger-related expenses and also restructuring costs. And so as a result of having those many items, we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, so that you can get a better sense of the underlying performance of our business. Also, since the merger was completed on November 3, the GAAP quarterly results only include two months of combined operations. So we have also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends as well. So in the press release there are five tables. Table 1 is the GAAP results. Table 2 and 3 reconcile our GAAP P&L to our non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter and also for the full year 2009. Table 4 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products, as if the company had been combined for the full year and also for the full fourth quarter of 2009. Table 5 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides sales for the major products and businesses, as if the company had been combined in 2008. That will help you make some growth comparisons in the 2009 period. During the call, we will be referring to Tables 2 and 3 when we discuss the P&L, and Table 4 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those tables available.

It was a little less than a year ago last March when we announced our plan to merge Merck and Schering-Plough. At the time, I told you that the combination made great strategic and financial sense and held exceptional promise, thanks to our stronger pipeline, more diverse product offerings across our broader range of businesses and an expanded global reach. In other words, our merger was and is about science and the increased relevance we now have to our customers. While this merger is about more than just cost, we stand firmly behind the financial targets we set last March. Today, we are pleased to report solid fourth quarter and full year 2009 results for the combined company. These results demonstrate the strong business focus each company maintained last year. That is a significant accomplishment, considering that the results were achieved in the midst of uncertain global economy, an ever-shifting healthcare landscape, extensive merger planning and then the start of integration once the merger was completed. In terms of top line, the company had sales of $10.1 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 revenue of $27.4 billion. The combined company had fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 and GAAP earnings per share of $2.35. Full year 2009 non-GAAP earnings were $3.25 per share, which excludes certain items in GAAP earnings of $5.65.  Our fourth quarter results were driven in part by the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough sales in our results, as well as the strong sales from JANUVIA, SINGULAIR and ISENTRESS. Peter Kellogg will provide you further financial details, as well as some thoughts on our outlook for the future.Since the merger closed in early November, we have moved quickly around the world to integrate our operations and begin taking advantage of the opportunities that come with the new Merck. Thus far, we are quite pleased with the pace of our progress in adopting best practices from each company, integrating the commercial organizations, planning our network strategy and consolidating the pipeline. In fact, since the merger's completion, our combined pipeline has been a top priority. I spent a considerable amount of time with Peter Kim and other senior Merck leaders to conduct a thorough review of the new combined pipeline, so we may better prioritize our efforts by franchise, phase, cost and geographic importance. I'm very enthusiastic about the work we've done on our powerful R&D pipeline, with more than 20 late-stage programs. We look forward to talking with you about that soon. By advancing the highest potential pipeline candidates, accelerating product development and launches, and maximizing the value of our medicines to full life-cycle management, we're focused on driving sustained innovation and revenue growth. We see three waves of new product opportunities over the near and long term that should contribute to our growth. Wave one is happening now, with products that are already in launch mode, such as SIMPONI, SAPHRIS and JANUVIA in Japan. Wave two focuses on near-term approvals. Just in the last few weeks, we had two key approvals, BRIDION and ELONVA. And we have four other key products under review as we speak. Wave three highlights our long-stage pipeline opportunities, which we believe are the best in the industry. Our strategy also includes continuing to tap into external sources of innovation to complement the work that is underway in our labs. We completed 51 licensing deals in 2009, with more to come this year; all of which could further our shareholder value.On the commercial side, we are building our capabilities and growth potential in vaccines, biologics and emerging markets. And they are sources of real focus and excitement within the new Merck. We are working hard on the strategies that will advance us to the next level in each of these growth areas. Here's a recent example. The acquisition of Avecia Biologics will allow Merck to build upon the biological expertise and manufacturing capability acquired during the past three decades at Schering-Plough. The new Merck's healthy and diversified product portfolio includes offerings from A to Z in a wide range of therapeutic areas from animal health to women's health. Each of our top 10 selling brands from our expanded product portfolio exceeds $1 billion in annual sales in 2009. In a few moments, Ken will talk about the performance of our key brands and how we're positioned the company's full portfolio of healthcare offerings for near term and future growth.Since late last year, we’ve built up the senior ranks of our new company with the best executives from both companies, as well as respected leaders with new capabilities and external experience. We're proud to welcome two new vaccine leaders: Former CDC Director, Dr. Julie Gerberding, as the leader of our Vaccine franchise; and Dr. Michael Kamarck, previously President of Product Supply at Wyeth, will lead Vaccines and Biologics manufacturing. We're also pleased to welcome to Merck Executive Committee former Dean of Tufts School of Medicine, Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, as Merck's new Chief Medical Officer; and Bridgette Heller, as the head of our Consumer Health Care business. Moving forward, we must realize the enormous value of our merger for patients, customers and shareholders. That includes gaining the benefit of fully integrating all aspects of the two formerly separate companies.We remain absolutely committed to our previously announced target of realizing merger synergies of $3.5 billion in annual savings in 2012. As part of these plans, we unveiled today a new multiphase global restructuring program designed to integrate and further optimize our operations and cost structure to support the more nimble, customer-focused and diversified healthcare leader Merck is becoming. We expect to complete the first phase of the program we announced today by the end of 2012. Additional phases of the merger restructuring program are expected to be announced later this year. We also expect to realize our savings through priority initiatives in areas, such as procurement. Building on earlier work begun in 2005, we're making progress in putting in place a best-in-industry cost structure. It will take time before we fully integrate off the axis of the two companies. The restructuring and integration process is complex, and includes changes that require our hard choices and difficult decisions, especially those that affect our colleagues throughout workforce reductions. But as we said all along, the majority of our colleagues from both legacy companies will be part of the new Merck going forward. Looking ahead into 2010 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about our goal in becoming the best healthcare company in the world. We continue to be committed to our long-term financial targets. But the real value driver of our merger will be science and innovation, because Merck's long-term strength will come from our ability to develop critical medicines and vaccines. What will set this merger apart is not just the what but the how, the clarity of our vision, our ability to hit the ground running and the thoughtfulness, which we will manage through the integration of our businesses, our operations and our people. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken."

As a newly combi",1826,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we drove solid performance across the Global Human Health portfolio, thanks to the strong growth of many of our key brands in markets around the world. As a newly combined company, we were off to a great start following the merger, and we will continue to focus on driving top line performance in 2010, especially for our new and faster growing brands. Overall, Global Human Health delivered a solid quarter, with recorded sales of $9.1 billion. When you would include all three months of Schering-Plough sales, our non-GAAP sales were $10.8 billion, which represents 9% growth from the previous year. The growth was broad-based, with eight of our top 10 product families growing in the fourth quarter. These eight franchises accounted for more than half of total sales, and grew a combined 15% over the previous year. We drove this growth across a diverse base of markets. Sales outside the U.S. increased by 13%,  which includes the favorable impact of foreign exchange. And inside the U.S., we generated growth of 3% compared to the previous year. In the U.S., sales in the fourth quarter were aided by approximately $100 million of wholesaler inventory buy-in, stockpile purchases of certain vaccines by the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the initial stocking for the SAPHRIS launch. Overall, I believe our fourth quarter performance is a good indicator that we are maintaining strong focus and momentum, while we integrate our teams. Before I discuss the performance of individual brands, I want to update you on the progress we have made since the completion of the merger. We will be integrating our businesses in markets around the world at different times, taking local considerations into account. As we do so, we will be leveraging the new commercial models that we had already implemented in nearly 30 markets.In the U.S., our experience with implementing Merck's new commercial model over the past two years prepared us to make critical staffing decisions quickly, with three very specific goals in mind: Retaining top talent, maintaining business momentum and minimizing disruption to our customers. In fact, by late January, we've completed the design and blending process to stand up the entire U.S. sales organization. Our U.S. sales force is now fully operational and completely focused on meeting customer needs. Our broader primary care offerings are ideally suited to the portfolio-based selling approach of the new commercial model, because the merger enables us to be more relevant to our customers across key franchises, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, women's health and other franchises.I want to emphasize one additional point about our integration efforts. While we focus on delivering the synergies that the merger creates, we are also making conscious, explicit decisions to invest to grow our business. So while we are reducing the size and cost of our commercial operations in more developed markets like the U.S., we are also making resource allocation decisions to grow our presence in major emerging markets. In fact, despite the economic volatility that we saw in these markets, our business grew by double digits in key emerging markets, like China and Brazil, during the fourth quarter.Also, as we indicated on the third quarter call, we made strategic investments to maintain and grow our key in-line growth drivers through additional promotional spending in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to do so this year. For JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR, for example, we made strategic investments in the fourth quarter to grow these brands. We also invested in our new product launches this quarter. These investments contributed to strong top line performance for many of our key brands. Now as I turn to individual product performance, I'll refer you to Table 4 from our supplemental financial package provided with our press release, so you can follow along. Starting with SINGULAIR, sales in the fourth quarter were $1.3 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. We saw double-digit growth in key markets, including the U.S., where we grew by 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Moving to JANUVIA and JANUMET, global revenue grew to a combined $760 million in the fourth quarter, up 43% versus the prior year. Now in the fourth year since its launch, we continue to drive strong performance for the JANUVIA/JANUMET franchise in markets around the world. JANUVIA and JANUMET remain the most prescribed products in the DPP-4 [dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor] class. We continue to invest in JANUVIA and JANUMET to maintain our leadership position in the diabetes markets and to grow this franchise. In the U.S., where we have recently seen the first DPP-4 competitor, we generated 24% growth versus fourth quarter 2008. We believe we can grow the franchise by taking share from the sulfonylureas as second-line treatment for appropriate patients. In addition, we are continuing our coupon program, which has been a success today.In the EU, we also have a labeling advantage. JANUVIA is the only DPP-4 approved for restricted first-line use and for use as an add-on to insulin. In Japan, which is a fast-growing oral diabetes market, we are in early stages of the JANUVIA launch. JANUVIA has an extremely strong value proposition, and is being reimbursed at a premium price to ACTOS. Despite Japan's practice of limiting new medicines to only a two-week patient supply in the first year, the initial tracking shows that the JANUVIA launch is going very well. We are building this franchise for the long term, indication-by-indication and country-by-country. We've submitted three sNDAs [supplemental New Drug Application] for sitagliptin in the U.S. to allow use with insulin, which would make sitagliptin the only DPP-4 approved for use with insulin, for initial use with pioglitazone and for use as add-on therapy with PPAR [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor] agonists and metformin. As you can see, there are many reasons why we expect that this franchise will continue to be a growth driver for Merck. I'd like to REMICADE and our newly launched biologic SIMPONI. We believe REMICADE and SIMPONI offer two great options for patients: REMICADE for rapidly progressing RA [rheumatoid arthritis] patients; and SIMPONI, the only once-monthly subcutaneous anti-TNF [tumor necrosis factor] available in the EU. In our first quarter combined operations, REMICADE delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth and reached a new quarterly high, with sales of $635 million, an increase of 29% over last year. The growth was broad-based, as we saw increased utilization across all six indications. We're maintaining our market share in rheumatoid arthritis despite new entrance to the market, and we continue to see solid performance and growth from the gastro indications, especially ulcerative colitis. For SIMPONI, we now have launched in five countries. To date, we have full reimbursement in Germany and Denmark. We plan to launch in many of the other large EU markets in the second half of 2010, as we gain reimbursement for SIMPONI from both public and private payers. In infectious disease, ISENTRESS continues to perform well and had another quarter of strong growth. Sales in the fourth quarter were $234 million, up 80% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and safety profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations.  ISENTRESS has become the new benchmark for an HIV launch and with the new treatment-naive indication, ISENTRESS is now approved for use across each stage in the treatment continuum.Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN, sales were $1.2 billion this quarter, which represents 6% growth compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by a 10% increase in the sales of ZETIA. For the franchise, sales in the U.S. declined 5%. However, this was more than offset by the strong growth of the brand outside the U.S., where the two brands grew by 23%, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange.The unique value proposition for these brands remains strong. And we continue to see growth opportunities in many markets around the world. I will now move two our Vaccine business, starting with GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the fourth quarter were $277 million, a 3% decline when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., we had about $70 million of favorability due mostly to a CDC stockpile purchase. Keep this in mind, as you model GARDASIL sales in subsequent quarters. X U.S. sales of GARDASIL as reported by Merck decreased 15%, attributable to the high-penetration rate and impact of large orders in 2008 in early-adopting countries, such as Mexico, Canada and Australia. Globally, we continue to outperform the competition, achieving an x U.S. market share of 77% in dollar terms in the fourth quarter and a global share of 87%.Sales of ProQuad, M-M-R II and VARIVAX combined increased 13% in the fourth quarter due to a CDC stockpile purchase of $64 million. If you exclude this favorability, sales would have decreased 9% year-over-year, largely due to the saturation in the varicella second dose catch-up cohort.Now moving to ZOSTAVAX, fourth quarter sales as reported by Merck were $76 million, down 53% from the previous year, largely due to the release of a very significant number of back orders in the fourth quarter of 2008. While we anticipate that ZOSTAVAX will be available in 2010 in the U.S., customers may experience back orders throughout this year. International launches of ZOSTAVAX will be delayed until 2011. Now, I'd like to make a few comments about COZAAR/HYZAAR, which grew 8% year-over-year. As you know, COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in early April, and COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose exclusivity in most major EU markets in the first quarter of 2010. In the U.S., we anticipate that multisource generics will be available immediately following the patent expiry, which we believe will lead to rapid erosion of sales from the current levels. And because internationally rosin rates have accelerated in recent years, we expect that the generic uptake in the EU will also be rapid.As we head further into 2010, I want to share with you how we are prioritizing our work in GHH, Global Human Health. First, we are focused on driving in-line brand performance and we will continue to make the necessary investments to grow as we integrate our operations. Second, we are focused on the launches of our new products. In addition to SIMPONI, which I mentioned previously, we have recently put more promotional resources behind the SAPHRIS launch in the U.S. Other opportunities we have this year in markets around the world include the launches of SAFLUTAN, TREDAPTIVE, ELONVA and BRIDION. Finally, while we focus on these opportunities, we are also creating a leaner, even more customer-focused organization that builds on the best of the Merck and Schering-Plough commercial organizations. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progresses. And now, it's my pleasure to pass it over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First,",2235,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First, I will cover what is included in our results. Second, I will provide an update on our fourth quarter performance. And third, I will comment on our outlook for 2010. So let's go to the results.We recognize that there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. The merger closed in the middle of the quarter and therefore, there are only two months of Schering-Plough included in the results. Our results also included the add-in complexity of purchase price accounting adjustments and restructuring charges, and the joint venture that is being unwound and reported in the combined company's results rather than in equity income. As Alex discussed in the opening, we included new tables in our press release and supplemental charts to help you navigate through the accounting. To make it easier for you to follow, I will speak mostly to the non-GAAP results in our remarks.Our non-GAAP results exclude restructuring costs, purchase price accounting adjustments, which included a $7.5 billion gain on the step-up of Merck's share in the MSP [Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals] partnership to current market value; merger-related costs; and a $400 million gain related to the sale of Merial in the quarter. On this basis, the new Merck reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. There are a number of factors that are reflected in our performance this quarter. First, we drove operational sales growth in many markets around the world, in part through higher promotional spending in support of our key brands and new launches. Second, we continued investing in our strong late-stage pipeline. Third, we had lower equity income from partnerships. And finally, we benefited from a lower combined company tax rate. In addition, as a result of the merger financing, our interest expense is higher and our interest income lower. And the number of common shares outstanding has substantially increased.Let's get into some of the individual items beginning with revenue. Total revenue for the quarter, as reported by Merck, was $10.1 billion, with about a 1% benefit from foreign exchange. On a supplemental-combined non-GAAP basis, which assumes Schering-Plough was included for all three months of the quarter in 2009 and 2008, sales were $12.2 billion, up 7%. You can see this in Table 4 provided today in our financial supplement.Ken just walked through the Human Health business results, so let me touch for a moment on our Animal and Consumer Health businesses. Animal Health sales totaled $759 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting continued growth among companion animal and poultry products. Consumer Health Care sales were $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting solid demand for OTC CLARITIN and foot care products.Now moving on to the expense items on the P&L. First, let's look at materials and production. The gross margin in the fourth quarter was approximately 74% versus 76% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline is primarily attributed to the inclusion of results from Schering-Plough, which has historically had a lower gross margin due to some major partnerships. Foreign exchange also had an unfavorable impact on the gross margin from Schering-Plough. Turning to marketing and administrative costs, M&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The majority of the increase over the fourth quarter of 2008 is attributable to the addition of Schering-Plough expenses and inclusion of the expenses from the Merck/Schering-Plough JV in the P&L and the impact of foreign exchange. Additionally, as we had anticipated, Merck had higher marketing expenses during the fourth quarter than in the first three quarters of 2009. We increased promotion in support of our key brands, and we are also investing to ensure the success of our new launches around the globe, including JANUVIA in Japan and TREDAPTIVE in the EU.As Ken mentioned, we have a number of launches in major markets underway today. And we have more on the way. We want to ensure the success of these launches by supporting them with the right level of promotion in 2010. Now let's turn to R&D. Research and development expenses for the new Merck and the fourth quarter where approximately $2 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D spending is up approximately $700 million this quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the addition of Schering-Plough R&D costs and the continued investment in late-stage opportunities such as TRA, boceprevir, demicative [ph], CORDAPTIVE, in our CETP inhibitor. Now let's move to equity income. In the fourth quarter, Merck recorded $374 million of equity income, a decline of $346 million over the prior year. The decline is attributable to three factors which you can derive from Table 6 in the financial supplement.  First, equity income in the quarter includes only one month of results from the MSP joint venture versus three months in the prior year. Post-closing of the merger, these results are reflected in sales and expenses of the new Merck. Second, a $75 million decline in the income from the AZLP joint ventures due to the timing variability of payments from AZLP. And third, the sale of Merial to our partner sanofi in the third quarter.Now let's talk about other income and expense. For the fourth quarter of 2009, other expense on a non-GAAP basis is $92 million compared to other income of $27 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. There are a few items driving this year-over-year change. First, most notable is the inclusion of interest expense from the Schering-Plough debt and the merger-related debt post closing. Second, interest income of $11 million was $137 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances.  Third, in the same quarter of last year, Merck recognized $74 million of exchange losses which did not recur this quarter. That helped to offset a portion of the negative interest expense and interest income comparisons. Now let's turn to the tax rate.  The new Merck non-GAAP tax rate is 15% for the fourth quarter. This reflects two dynamics. First, on the Merck side, there was some one-time benefits that aren't likely to recur. Second, we had the benefit related to the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough during the two-month sub-period. And this sub-period had a much lower tax rate than legacy Merck.  For 2010, we don't anticipate a significant change in the rate that we saw in 2009 on a full year basis excluding discreet items. Our full year 2009 rate was approximately 23% when you exclude discreet items in the first and second quarters.Okay, so that's the fourth quarter. As you can see, there a lot of moving parts. Here's how I think about our performance this quarter. We had strong growth in sales of our key brands. At the same time, we continued investment in the future success of our newest products and our late-stage pipeline. So overall, a solid start to the new Merck. Now let's talk about where we're going beginning with 2010.  As we already indicated, we'll provide 2010 financial guidance around the timing of our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'd like to provide you with some perspective that I believe will be helpful. As we step back and look at new Merck, we are pleased with our many opportunities ahead. We continue to target a high single digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 for the combined company when compared to Merck 2009 non-GAAP EPS.  Looking ahead over this next four-year period, we do anticipate that some years will be stronger than others. For example, 2010 has several factors that will be challenging. During 2010, we will begin to realize synergies from the merger. However, we also face the loss of patent protection for COZAAR/HYZAAR and TEMODAR, products that contribute $3.1 billion of revenues in the Europe U.S. last year. And we will continue to invest in launched brands.So as we think about 2010, there are four areas that I'd like to specifically call to your attention. First, let's start with the sales line. The merger has improved our longer term patent position and we are launching many new products like SAPHRIS and SIMPONI. However, we do faced significant patent losses in 2010. The biggest is COZAAR/HYZAAR. So how should you think about that in 2010? Well, first, in the first quarter, we expect to pullback in the COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventory levels to below-normal levels as the patent expiry date approaches. Second, as Ken mentioned, we believe that the erosion rate will be fast as multiple generics enter the market after the patent expires. The second 2010 patent issue were not as large as TEMODAR, one of our high-margin products. In the U.S., we were disappointed by the recent District Court judgment and then filed an appeal in a motion for a preliminary injunction to allow the Court time to hear our appeal. In addition, TEMODAR lost patent protection in Europe in 2009 and we expect continued erosion. Despite the impressive number of new product launches in 2010, they will not be able to compensate for these two patent losses.Now second, let's talk abut synergies. We are committed to a merger-related cost synergies of $3.5 billion annually in 2012. The first phase of our Merger Restructuring Program that Dick told you about is expected to contribute $2.6 billion to $3 billion to this annual target. As we said, additional phases will be announced by the end of 2010.  We expect to see significant synergies, mostly on the M&A line in 2010. As a result, we expect the M&A line to be down on a full year basis in 2010 versus what the two companies spent individually in 2009. Please keep in mind that these synergies build over time. Very importantly, we expect the synergies in 2010 to be back-end loaded with about two-thirds of the synergies coming in the second half of the year. This will cause the shape of the earnings curve during 2010 to be quite back-end loaded.Now let's talk about the third area which is R&D where we have two dynamics underway. On the one hand, we are investing in our late-stage pipeline. On the other hand, we're driving efficiencies through the combined R&D infrastructure. Coming into the merger, Schering-Plough and Merck each had strong and growing R&D pipelines. And on a stand-alone basis, each company expected to significantly increase its level of R&D investment in 2010 due to the richness of its late-stage pipeline and the many ongoing large outcomes trials.Let me give you a sense of scale. In cardiovascular disease alone, we had more than 80,000 patients currently in our clinical trials. And that number is expected to grow to more than 100,000 patients before those trials end. So therefore, based on this level of Phase III project activity, we expect that the level of R&D investments in 2010 will be similar to slightly higher than levels seen in 2009 for both companies on a combined basis. We believe that making these 2010 investments are the best way to drive shareholder value. Lastly, let's talk about the timing of certain items this year. There are a number of items that will affect the early part of the year and specifically Q1. First, Q1 is typically the softest quarter of the year due to the seasonality of our respiratory and vaccine franchises. We saw this in the first quarter of 2009. Second, we have the expected pull down in COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventories in Q1 that I mentioned earlier. Third, there was approximately $135 million of favorable vaccine revenue in Q4 primarily due to a number of CDC stockpile purchases, and these will not recur in the first quarter.  Fourth, we had a low tax rate in the fourth quarter that we do not expect to recur this year. Also, aside from the seasonality, these items relate to Q1 but obviously, they want a similar impact on the full year results. So let me summarize. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that non-GAAP earnings in the second half of 2010 will be considerably higher than non-GAAP earnings in the first half of 2010 due to the phasing in of synergies. In fact, we believe our non-GAAP EPS run rate in the second half of this year will provide strong evidence that we are heading towards our long-term EPS goal. We are on track to have a good first full year as a combined company. We will continue our business momentum for key brands and launch products. We remain very excited about the future of the new Merck. And we continue to target high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate in 2009 to 2013 for the combined company.  As Dick emphasized, this is a company that will build its long-term strength through science and innovation. We look forward to speaking with you about the products, the pipeline and the strategy of the new Merck during our second quarter R&D and business update meeting. Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Alex. Alex?"

I think to answer the first part of your question, what we've been focusing on from a research standpoint is our prioritization really beginning with the portfolio. So as we said, we're spending a great deal of time understanding the portfolio and making decisions by phase, by value, by geography, by unmet medical need of what we need to do to put a portfolio together for the new company. We're also spending a great deal of time now focusing in on talent and scientific capabilities and the people that we need to be able to run this research organization. And obviously, the last thing that we spend time on then is the site. So once you have the portfolio, the projects and the people decided you can look at price. I think one of the advantages we have in how we run the entire company is not only in research but in Global Human Health as well is that we really have franchise heads. And so having a general manager for franchise in the commercial side and one on the research side, allows us to think about franchises both in the commercial and research standpoint, allows better focus and allows us to make portfolio decisions even though the research capability has expanded as we move forward."

Secondly, we haven't really given R&D long-term guidance yet. And obviously, that's something we'll do when we get out towards the first quarter earnings call. But I do want to remind everybody that our long-term perspective on the company is that we will have high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth over the time period that we talked about. And that we are going to see a nice pretax margin improvement as we go from today to that timeframe. We highlighted on the time of merger that we’re shooting for something that begins to approach the 40% level. It's obviously based on the current expectations and what we know at this point. But that implies that there will be productivity in all the lines as we go through the P&L and that will be something you'll be seeing particularly, as all the different integration steps are going on in our R&D organizations come to bear. But I do think, as Dick said, in the beginning, this is about science and innovation and global expansion and having really world-class organizations in every function. And so we are going to be making sure that we make the right investments in all the areas and yet still drive great productivity throughout the company."

And so that strategy that we put together with Billy's help was -- continue in the future. Billy is staying on as a consultant with us as well. And I think that's important.

And your general question about marketing expenditures, I can just summarize by saying, we continue to put money behind our growth drivers. We're very pleased, for example, with the recent trends around JANUVIA. We mentioned before that we were really going to focus on JANUVIA before we had put the focus on messaging, the importance of maximizing BBP IV inhibition, to try to blog [ph] the introduction of in-class competition, we've expanded our approach. We've now started to focus on the ability to work competitively against so far in areas and we have been encouraged by the focus and the resources that put behind JANUVIA in terms of the increased volumes in December and January. So we continue to view JANUVIA and JANUMET as well as some of our other in-line products as key growth drivers in the U.S. market and beyond."

And so as a result of having those many items, we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, so that you can get a better sense of the underlying performance of our business. Also, since the merger was completed on November 3, the GAAP quarterly results only include two months of combined operations. So we have also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends as well. So in the press release there are five tables. Table 1 is the GAAP results. Table 2 and 3 reconcile our GAAP P&L to our non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter and also for the full year 2009. Table 4 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products, as if the company had been combined for the full year and also for the full fourth quarter of 2009. Table 5 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides sales for the major products and businesses, as if the company had been combined in 2008. That will help you make some growth comparisons in the 2009 period. During the call, we will be referring to Tables 2 and 3 when we discuss the P&L, and Table 4 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those tables available.

Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties. The company's SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2008 10-K, identifies certain factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today.

It was a little less than a year ago last March when we announced our plan to merge Merck and Schering-Plough. At the time, I told you that the combination made great strategic and financial sense and held exceptional promise, thanks to our stronger pipeline, more diverse product offerings across our broader range of businesses and an expanded global reach. In other words, our merger was and is about science and the increased relevance we now have to our customers. While this merger is about more than just cost, we stand firmly behind the financial targets we set last March. Today, we are pleased to report solid fourth quarter and full year 2009 results for the combined company. These results demonstrate the strong business focus each company maintained last year. That is a significant accomplishment, considering that the results were achieved in the midst of uncertain global economy, an ever-shifting healthcare landscape, extensive merger planning and then the start of integration once the merger was completed. In terms of top line, the company had sales of $10.1 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 revenue of $27.4 billion. The combined company had fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 and GAAP earnings per share of $2.35. Full year 2009 non-GAAP earnings were $3.25 per share, which excludes certain items in GAAP earnings of $5.65.  Our fourth quarter results were driven in part by the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough sales in our results, as well as the strong sales from JANUVIA, SINGULAIR and ISENTRESS. Peter Kellogg will provide you further financial details, as well as some thoughts on our outlook for the future.Since the merger closed in early November, we have moved quickly around the world to integrate our operations and begin taking advantage of the opportunities that come with the new Merck. Thus far, we are quite pleased with the pace of our progress in adopting best practices from each company, integrating the commercial organizations, planning our network strategy and consolidating the pipeline. In fact, since the merger's completion, our combined pipeline has been a top priority. I spent a considerable amount of time with Peter Kim and other senior Merck leaders to conduct a thorough review of the new combined pipeline, so we may better prioritize our efforts by franchise, phase, cost and geographic importance. I'm very enthusiastic about the work we've done on our powerful R&D pipeline, with more than 20 late-stage programs. We look forward to talking with you about that soon. By advancing the highest potential pipeline candidates, accelerating product development and launches, and maximizing the value of our medicines to full life-cycle management, we're focused on driving sustained innovation and revenue growth. We see three waves of new product opportunities over the near and long term that should contribute to our growth. Wave one is happening now, with products that are already in launch mode, such as SIMPONI, SAPHRIS and JANUVIA in Japan. Wave two focuses on near-term approvals. Just in the last few weeks, we had two key approvals, BRIDION and ELONVA. And we have four other key products under review as we speak. Wave three highlights our long-stage pipeline opportunities, which we believe are the best in the industry. Our strategy also includes continuing to tap into external sources of innovation to complement the work that is underway in our labs. We completed 51 licensing deals in 2009, with more to come this year; all of which could further our shareholder value.On the commercial side, we are building our capabilities and growth potential in vaccines, biologics and emerging markets. And they are sources of real focus and excitement within the new Merck. We are working hard on the strategies that will advance us to the next level in each of these growth areas. Here's a recent example. The acquisition of Avecia Biologics will allow Merck to build upon the biological expertise and manufacturing capability acquired during the past three decades at Schering-Plough. The new Merck's healthy and diversified product portfolio includes offerings from A to Z in a wide range of therapeutic areas from animal health to women's health. Each of our top 10 selling brands from our expanded product portfolio exceeds $1 billion in annual sales in 2009. In a few moments, Ken will talk about the performance of our key brands and how we're positioned the company's full portfolio of healthcare offerings for near term and future growth.Since late last year, we’ve built up the senior ranks of our new company with the best executives from both companies, as well as respected leaders with new capabilities and external experience. We're proud to welcome two new vaccine leaders: Former CDC Director, Dr. Julie Gerberding, as the leader of our Vaccine franchise; and Dr. Michael Kamarck, previously President of Product Supply at Wyeth, will lead Vaccines and Biologics manufacturing. We're also pleased to welcome to Merck Executive Committee former Dean of Tufts School of Medicine, Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, as Merck's new Chief Medical Officer; and Bridgette Heller, as the head of our Consumer Health Care business. Moving forward, we must realize the enormous value of our merger for patients, customers and shareholders. That includes gaining the benefit of fully integrating all aspects of the two formerly separate companies.We remain absolutely committed to our previously announced target of realizing merger synergies of $3.5 billion in annual savings in 2012. As part of these plans, we unveiled today a new multiphase global restructuring program designed to integrate and further optimize our operations and cost structure to support the more nimble, customer-focused and diversified healthcare leader Merck is becoming. We expect to complete the first phase of the program we announced today by the end of 2012. Additional phases of the merger restructuring program are expected to be announced later this year. We also expect to realize our savings through priority initiatives in areas, such as procurement. Building on earlier work begun in 2005, we're making progress in putting in place a best-in-industry cost structure. It will take time before we fully integrate off the axis of the two companies. The restructuring and integration process is complex, and includes changes that require our hard choices and difficult decisions, especially those that affect our colleagues throughout workforce reductions. But as we said all along, the majority of our colleagues from both legacy companies will be part of the new Merck going forward. Looking ahead into 2010 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about our goal in becoming the best healthcare company in the world. We continue to be committed to our long-term financial targets. But the real value driver of our merger will be science and innovation, because Merck's long-term strength will come from our ability to develop critical medicines and vaccines. What will set this merger apart is not just the what but the how, the clarity of our vision, our ability to hit the ground running and the thoughtfulness, which we will manage through the integration of our businesses, our operations and our people. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken."

As a newly combi",1826,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we drove solid performance across the Global Human Health portfolio, thanks to the strong growth of many of our key brands in markets around the world. As a newly combined company, we were off to a great start following the merger, and we will continue to focus on driving top line performance in 2010, especially for our new and faster growing brands. Overall, Global Human Health delivered a solid quarter, with recorded sales of $9.1 billion. When you would include all three months of Schering-Plough sales, our non-GAAP sales were $10.8 billion, which represents 9% growth from the previous year. The growth was broad-based, with eight of our top 10 product families growing in the fourth quarter. These eight franchises accounted for more than half of total sales, and grew a combined 15% over the previous year. We drove this growth across a diverse base of markets. Sales outside the U.S. increased by 13%,  which includes the favorable impact of foreign exchange. And inside the U.S., we generated growth of 3% compared to the previous year. In the U.S., sales in the fourth quarter were aided by approximately $100 million of wholesaler inventory buy-in, stockpile purchases of certain vaccines by the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the initial stocking for the SAPHRIS launch. Overall, I believe our fourth quarter performance is a good indicator that we are maintaining strong focus and momentum, while we integrate our teams. Before I discuss the performance of individual brands, I want to update you on the progress we have made since the completion of the merger. We will be integrating our businesses in markets around the world at different times, taking local considerations into account. As we do so, we will be leveraging the new commercial models that we had already implemented in nearly 30 markets.In the U.S., our experience with implementing Merck's new commercial model over the past two years prepared us to make critical staffing decisions quickly, with three very specific goals in mind: Retaining top talent, maintaining business momentum and minimizing disruption to our customers. In fact, by late January, we've completed the design and blending process to stand up the entire U.S. sales organization. Our U.S. sales force is now fully operational and completely focused on meeting customer needs. Our broader primary care offerings are ideally suited to the portfolio-based selling approach of the new commercial model, because the merger enables us to be more relevant to our customers across key franchises, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, women's health and other franchises.I want to emphasize one additional point about our integration efforts. While we focus on delivering the synergies that the merger creates, we are also making conscious, explicit decisions to invest to grow our business. So while we are reducing the size and cost of our commercial operations in more developed markets like the U.S., we are also making resource allocation decisions to grow our presence in major emerging markets. In fact, despite the economic volatility that we saw in these markets, our business grew by double digits in key emerging markets, like China and Brazil, during the fourth quarter.Also, as we indicated on the third quarter call, we made strategic investments to maintain and grow our key in-line growth drivers through additional promotional spending in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to do so this year. For JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR, for example, we made strategic investments in the fourth quarter to grow these brands. We also invested in our new product launches this quarter. These investments contributed to strong top line performance for many of our key brands. Now as I turn to individual product performance, I'll refer you to Table 4 from our supplemental financial package provided with our press release, so you can follow along. Starting with SINGULAIR, sales in the fourth quarter were $1.3 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. We saw double-digit growth in key markets, including the U.S., where we grew by 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Moving to JANUVIA and JANUMET, global revenue grew to a combined $760 million in the fourth quarter, up 43% versus the prior year. Now in the fourth year since its launch, we continue to drive strong performance for the JANUVIA/JANUMET franchise in markets around the world. JANUVIA and JANUMET remain the most prescribed products in the DPP-4 [dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor] class. We continue to invest in JANUVIA and JANUMET to maintain our leadership position in the diabetes markets and to grow this franchise. In the U.S., where we have recently seen the first DPP-4 competitor, we generated 24% growth versus fourth quarter 2008. We believe we can grow the franchise by taking share from the sulfonylureas as second-line treatment for appropriate patients. In addition, we are continuing our coupon program, which has been a success today.In the EU, we also have a labeling advantage. JANUVIA is the only DPP-4 approved for restricted first-line use and for use as an add-on to insulin. In Japan, which is a fast-growing oral diabetes market, we are in early stages of the JANUVIA launch. JANUVIA has an extremely strong value proposition, and is being reimbursed at a premium price to ACTOS. Despite Japan's practice of limiting new medicines to only a two-week patient supply in the first year, the initial tracking shows that the JANUVIA launch is going very well. We are building this franchise for the long term, indication-by-indication and country-by-country. We've submitted three sNDAs [supplemental New Drug Application] for sitagliptin in the U.S. to allow use with insulin, which would make sitagliptin the only DPP-4 approved for use with insulin, for initial use with pioglitazone and for use as add-on therapy with PPAR [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor] agonists and metformin. As you can see, there are many reasons why we expect that this franchise will continue to be a growth driver for Merck. I'd like to REMICADE and our newly launched biologic SIMPONI. We believe REMICADE and SIMPONI offer two great options for patients: REMICADE for rapidly progressing RA [rheumatoid arthritis] patients; and SIMPONI, the only once-monthly subcutaneous anti-TNF [tumor necrosis factor] available in the EU. In our first quarter combined operations, REMICADE delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth and reached a new quarterly high, with sales of $635 million, an increase of 29% over last year. The growth was broad-based, as we saw increased utilization across all six indications. We're maintaining our market share in rheumatoid arthritis despite new entrance to the market, and we continue to see solid performance and growth from the gastro indications, especially ulcerative colitis. For SIMPONI, we now have launched in five countries. To date, we have full reimbursement in Germany and Denmark. We plan to launch in many of the other large EU markets in the second half of 2010, as we gain reimbursement for SIMPONI from both public and private payers. In infectious disease, ISENTRESS continues to perform well and had another quarter of strong growth. Sales in the fourth quarter were $234 million, up 80% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and safety profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations.  ISENTRESS has become the new benchmark for an HIV launch and with the new treatment-naive indication, ISENTRESS is now approved for use across each stage in the treatment continuum.Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN, sales were $1.2 billion this quarter, which represents 6% growth compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by a 10% increase in the sales of ZETIA. For the franchise, sales in the U.S. declined 5%. However, this was more than offset by the strong growth of the brand outside the U.S., where the two brands grew by 23%, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange.The unique value proposition for these brands remains strong. And we continue to see growth opportunities in many markets around the world. I will now move two our Vaccine business, starting with GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the fourth quarter were $277 million, a 3% decline when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., we had about $70 million of favorability due mostly to a CDC stockpile purchase. Keep this in mind, as you model GARDASIL sales in subsequent quarters. X U.S. sales of GARDASIL as reported by Merck decreased 15%, attributable to the high-penetration rate and impact of large orders in 2008 in early-adopting countries, such as Mexico, Canada and Australia. Globally, we continue to outperform the competition, achieving an x U.S. market share of 77% in dollar terms in the fourth quarter and a global share of 87%.Sales of ProQuad, M-M-R II and VARIVAX combined increased 13% in the fourth quarter due to a CDC stockpile purchase of $64 million. If you exclude this favorability, sales would have decreased 9% year-over-year, largely due to the saturation in the varicella second dose catch-up cohort.Now moving to ZOSTAVAX, fourth quarter sales as reported by Merck were $76 million, down 53% from the previous year, largely due to the release of a very significant number of back orders in the fourth quarter of 2008. While we anticipate that ZOSTAVAX will be available in 2010 in the U.S., customers may experience back orders throughout this year. International launches of ZOSTAVAX will be delayed until 2011. Now, I'd like to make a few comments about COZAAR/HYZAAR, which grew 8% year-over-year. As you know, COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in early April, and COZAAR/HYZAAR will lose exclusivity in most major EU markets in the first quarter of 2010. In the U.S., we anticipate that multisource generics will be available immediately following the patent expiry, which we believe will lead to rapid erosion of sales from the current levels. And because internationally rosin rates have accelerated in recent years, we expect that the generic uptake in the EU will also be rapid.As we head further into 2010, I want to share with you how we are prioritizing our work in GHH, Global Human Health. First, we are focused on driving in-line brand performance and we will continue to make the necessary investments to grow as we integrate our operations. Second, we are focused on the launches of our new products. In addition to SIMPONI, which I mentioned previously, we have recently put more promotional resources behind the SAPHRIS launch in the U.S. Other opportunities we have this year in markets around the world include the launches of SAFLUTAN, TREDAPTIVE, ELONVA and BRIDION. Finally, while we focus on these opportunities, we are also creating a leaner, even more customer-focused organization that builds on the best of the Merck and Schering-Plough commercial organizations. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progresses. And now, it's my pleasure to pass it over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First,",2243,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our merger is off to a great start. We generated good sales and earnings results, while making a lot of headway on the integration. Today, I'd like to cover three items with you. First, I will cover what is included in our results. Second, I will provide an update on our fourth quarter performance. And third, I will comment on our outlook for 2010. So let's go to the results.We recognize that there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. The merger closed in the middle of the quarter and therefore, there are only two months of Schering-Plough included in the results. Our results also included the add-in complexity of purchase price accounting adjustments and restructuring charges, and the joint venture that is being unwound and reported in the combined company's results rather than in equity income. As Alex discussed in the opening, we included new tables in our press release and supplemental charts to help you navigate through the accounting. To make it easier for you to follow, I will speak mostly to the non-GAAP results in our remarks.Our non-GAAP results exclude restructuring costs, purchase price accounting adjustments, which included a $7.5 billion gain on the step-up of Merck's share in the MSP [Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals] partnership to current market value; merger-related costs; and a $400 million gain related to the sale of Merial in the quarter. On this basis, the new Merck reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. There are a number of factors that are reflected in our performance this quarter. First, we drove operational sales growth in many markets around the world, in part through higher promotional spending in support of our key brands and new launches. Second, we continued investing in our strong late-stage pipeline. Third, we had lower equity income from partnerships. And finally, we benefited from a lower combined company tax rate. In addition, as a result of the merger financing, our interest expense is higher and our interest income lower. And the number of common shares outstanding has substantially increased.Let's get into some of the individual items beginning with revenue. Total revenue for the quarter, as reported by Merck, was $10.1 billion, with about a 1% benefit from foreign exchange. On a supplemental-combined non-GAAP basis, which assumes Schering-Plough was included for all three months of the quarter in 2009 and 2008, sales were $12.2 billion, up 7%. You can see this in Table 4 provided today in our financial supplement.Ken just walked through the Human Health business results, so let me touch for a moment on our Animal and Consumer Health businesses. Animal Health sales totaled $759 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting continued growth among companion animal and poultry products. Consumer Health Care sales were $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, reflecting solid demand for OTC CLARITIN and foot care products.Now moving on to the expense items on the P&L. First, let's look at materials and production. The gross margin in the fourth quarter was approximately 74% versus 76% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline is primarily attributed to the inclusion of results from Schering-Plough, which has historically had a lower gross margin due to some major partnerships. Foreign exchange also had an unfavorable impact on the gross margin from Schering-Plough. Turning to marketing and administrative costs, M&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The majority of the increase over the fourth quarter of 2008 is attributable to the addition of Schering-Plough expenses and inclusion of the expenses from the Merck/Schering-Plough JV in the P&L and the impact of foreign exchange. Additionally, as we had anticipated, Merck had higher marketing expenses during the fourth quarter than in the first three quarters of 2009. We increased promotion in support of our key brands, and we are also investing to ensure the success of our new launches around the globe, including JANUVIA in Japan and TREDAPTIVE in the EU.As Ken mentioned, we have a number of launches in major markets underway today. And we have more on the way. We want to ensure the success of these launches by supporting them with the right level of promotion in 2010. Now let's turn to R&D. Research and development expenses for the new Merck in the fourth quarter where approximately $2 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D spending is up approximately $700 million this quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the addition of Schering-Plough R&D costs and the continued investment in late-stage opportunities such as TRA, boceprevir, demicative [ph] (41:08), CORDAPTIVE and our CETP inhibitor. Now let's move to equity income. In the fourth quarter, Merck recorded $374 million of equity income, a decline of $346 million over the prior year. The decline is attributable to three factors which you can derive from Table 6 in the financial supplement.  First, equity income in the quarter includes only one month of results from the MSP joint venture versus three months in the prior year. Post-closing of the merger, these results are reflected in sales and expenses of the new Merck. Second, a $75 million decline in the income from the AZLP joint venture is due to the timing variability of payments from AZLP. And third, the sale of Merial to our partner sanofi in the third quarter.Now let's talk about other income and expense. For the fourth quarter of 2009, other expense on a non-GAAP basis is $92 million compared to other income of $27 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. There are a few items driving this year-over-year change. First, most notable is the inclusion of interest expense from the Schering-Plough debt and the merger-related debt post closing. Second, interest income of $11 million was $137 million lower when compared to the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances.  Third, in the same quarter of last year, Merck recognized $74 million of exchange losses which did not recur this quarter. That helped to offset a portion of the negative interest expense and interest income comparisons. Now let's turn to the tax rate.  The new Merck non-GAAP tax rate is 15% for the fourth quarter. This reflects two dynamics. First, on the Merck side, there was some one-time benefits that aren't likely to recur. Second, we have the benefit related to the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough during the two-month stub period, and this stub period had a much lower tax rate than legacy Merck.  For 2010, we don't anticipate a significant change to the rate that we saw in 2009 on a full year basis, excluding discreet items. Our full year 2009 rate was approximately 23% when you exclude the discreet items in the first and second quarters.Okay, so that's the fourth quarter. As you can see, there are a lot of moving parts. Here's how I think about our performance this quarter. We had strong growth in sales of our key brands. At the same time, we continued investment in the future success of our newest products and our late-stage pipeline. So overall, a solid start to the new Merck. Now let's talk about where we're going, beginning with 2010.  As we already indicated, we will provide 2010 financial guidance around the timing of our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'd like to provide you with some perspective that I believe will be helpful. As we step back and look at new Merck, we are pleased with our many opportunities ahead. We continue to target a high single digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 for the combined company when compared to Merck 2009 non-GAAP EPS.  Looking ahead over this next four-year period, we do anticipate that some years will be stronger than others. For example, 2010 has several factors that will be challenging. During 2010, we will begin to realize synergies from the merger. However, we also face the loss of patent protection for COZAAR/HYZAAR and TEMODAR, products that contributed $3.1 billion of revenue in the U.S. and Europe last year. And we will continue to invest in launched brands.So as we think about 2010, there are four areas that I'd like to specifically call to your attention. First, let's start with the sales line. The merger has improved our longer-term patent position, and we are launching many new products like SAPHRIS and SIMPONI. However, we do face significant patent losses in 2010. The biggest is COZAAR/HYZAAR. So how should you think about that in 2010? Well, first, in the first quarter, we expect to pullback in the COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventory levels to below-normal levels as the patent expiry date approaches. Second, as Ken mentioned, we believe that the erosion rate will be fast as multiple generics enter the market after the patent expires. The second 2010 patent issue were not as large as TEMODAR, one of our high-margin products. In the U.S., we were disappointed by the recent District Court judgment, and then filed an appeal in a motion for a preliminary injunction to allow the Court time to hear our appeal. In addition, TEMODAR lost patent protection in Europe in 2009, and we expect continued erosion. Despite the impressive number of new product launches in 2010, they will not be able to compensate for these two patent losses.Now second, let's talk abut synergies. We are committed to merger-related cost synergies of $3.5 billion annually in 2012. The first phase of our Merger Restructuring Program that Dick told you about is expected to contribute $2.6 billion to $3 billion to this annual target. As we said, additional phases will be announced by the end of 2010.  We expect to see significant synergies mostly on the M&A line in 2010. As a result, we expect the M&A line to be down on a full year basis in 2010 versus what the two companies spent individually in 2009. Please keep in mind that these synergies build over time. Very importantly, we expect the synergies in 2010 to be back-end loaded with about 2/3 of the synergies coming in the second half of the year. This will cause the shape of the earnings curve during 2010 to be quite back-end loaded.Now let's talk about the third area which is R&D where we have two dynamics underway. On the one hand, we are investing in our late-stage pipeline. On the other hand, we are driving efficiencies through the combined R&D infrastructure. Coming into the merger, Schering-Plough and Merck each had strong and growing R&D pipelines. And on a stand-alone basis, each company expected to significantly increase its level of R&D investment in 2010 due to the richness of its late-stage pipeline and the many ongoing large outcomes trials.Let me give you a sense of scale. In cardiovascular disease alone, we had more than 80,000 patients currently in our clinical trials, and that number is expected to grow to more than 100,000 patients before those trials end. So therefore, based on this level of Phase III project activity, we expect that the level of R&D investments in 2010 will be similar to slightly higher than the levels seen in 2009 for both companies on a combined basis. We believe that making these 2010 investments are the best way to drive shareholder value. Lastly, let's talk about the timing of certain items this year. There are a number of items that will affect the early part of the year and specifically Q1. First, Q1 is typically the softest quarter of the year due to the seasonality of our respiratory and vaccine franchises. We saw this in the first quarter of 2009. Second, we have the expected pull down in COZAAR/HYZAAR trade inventories in Q1 that I mentioned earlier. Third, there was approximately $135 million of favorable vaccine revenue in Q4, primarily due to a number of CDC stockpile purchases, and these will not recur in the first quarter.  Fourth, we had a low tax rate in the fourth quarter that we do not expect to recur this year. Also, aside from the seasonality, these items relate to Q1 but obviously, they wanted a similar impact on the full year results. So let me summarize. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that non-GAAP earnings in the second half of 2010 will be considerably higher than non-GAAP earnings in the first half of 2010 due to the phasing in of synergies. In fact, we believe our non-GAAP EPS run rate in the second half of this year will provide strong evidence that we are heading towards our long-term EPS goal. We are on track to have a good first full year as a combined company. We will continue our business momentum for key brands and launch products. We remain very excited about the future of the new Merck. And we continue to target high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate in 2009 to 2013 for the combined company.  As Dick emphasized, this is a company that will build its long-term strength through science and innovation. We look forward to speaking with you about the products, the pipeline and the strategy of the new Merck during our second quarter R&D and business update meeting. Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Alex. Alex?"

I think to answer the first part of your question, what we've been focusing on from a research standpoint is our prioritization really beginning with the portfolio. So as we said, we're spending a great deal of time understanding the portfolio and making decisions by phase, by value, by geography, by unmet medical need of what we need to do to put a portfolio together for the new company. We're also spending a great deal of time now focusing in on talent and scientific capabilities and the people that we need to be able to run this research organization. And obviously, the last thing that we spend time on then is the site. So once you have the portfolio, the projects and the people decided you can look at price. I think one of the advantages we have in how we run the entire company is not only in research but in Global Human Health as well is that we really have franchise heads. And so having a general manager for franchise in the commercial side and one on the research side, allows us to think about franchises both in the commercial and research standpoint, allows better focus and allows us to make portfolio decisions even though the research capability has expanded as we move forward."

Secondly, we haven't really given R&D long-term guidance yet. And obviously, that's something we'll do when we get out towards the first quarter earnings call. But I do want to remind everybody that our long-term perspective on the company is that we will have high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth over the time period that we talked about. And that we are going to see a nice pretax margin improvement as we go from today to that timeframe. We highlighted on the time of merger that we’re shooting for something that begins to approach the 40% level. It's obviously based on the current expectations and what we know at this point. But that implies that there will be productivity in all the lines as we go through the P&L and that will be something you'll be seeing particularly, as all the different integration steps are going on in our R&D organizations come to bear. But I do think, as Dick said, in the beginning, this is about science and innovation and global expansion and having really world-class organizations in every function. And so we are going to be making sure that we make the right investments in all the areas and yet still drive great productivity throughout the company."

So they are synergies across those groups. At the same time, we continue to invest behind the products from a promotional standpoint to ensure that they're competitively resourced. And as I said earlier, we feel very optimistic about the stabilization of trends as well as the continued growth outside the U.S. On the vaccine issues around supply, we mentioned earlier on that we aren't continuing to make ZOSTAVAX available in 2010. But customers may experience some back orders throughout the year as our varicella product continues to be prioritized for use in manufacturing VARIVAX. So that will delay our launches outside the U.S. RECOMBIVAX pediatric became fully available in the U.S. as of early December. Pedvax here became fully available in the U.S. market as in January. Beyond that, we continue to make significant investments in our vaccine manufacturing capabilities. We've recently invested over $1 billion in new manufacturing resources and we expect our North Carolina facility to begin operations by the middle of this year. So we have some issues with respect to our varicella vaccines which we continue to work diligently on to minimize any disruption."

As I mentioned in my talk, we felt that the revenue benefited about 1% from foreign exchange. Now Merck's year-over-year benefit from foreign exchange is not as pronounced as you might see in some other pharma companies, and recall that we had the benefit of a hedging program in the fourth quarter of last year when the currencies were really moving rapidly. We have some nice gains from a hedging position that we had. So that moderates the year-over-year benefit. But net-net, what I can say is that the EPS benefit on the bottom line is moderately better than what you see on the top line, but not really dramatic.

We've also excluded the impact of the tax charge related to healthcare reform, as Peter Kellogg will discuss. 
We've provided you a number of tables in our earnings release to help you understand the trend, and in particular, there are five tables. There's a table on the GAAP sales results. Table 2 and 3 deal with our reconciled GAAP P&L to our non-GAAP results.

And Table 5 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales for the major products. 
So during the call, we'll be referring mostly to Tables 2 and 3 when we discuss the P&L, and Table 4 when we discussed the revenue performance. I'd also like to remind you that next Tuesday, May 11, we are hosting our first R&D and business briefing, and as a result, we won't be discussing individual R&D projects on this call.

Today, we reported the first full quarter of financial results for the new Merck. Our first quarter 2010 results demonstrate early success in the integration of Merck's worldwide operations, and we are well-positioned to continue the grow globally and achieve our overarching goal of becoming the best healthcare company in the world. 
On the top line, the company recorded worldwide sales of $11.4 billion for the first quarter. Earnings per share for the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $0.83 versus $0.74 for the last year's first quarter for the standalone Merck. So you can see that our merger is already producing positive results. These results reflect the new Merck's expanded global footprint and the strong sales performance of key brands, including JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and TEMODAR. I think you can see from our results that we are focused on driving revenue growth, maintaining the momentum of the business and reducing our cost structure.
In a few moments, Ken will provide you with additional details around our specific global product performance. In today's announcement, we shared our financial targets for the full year 2010, and also reaffirmed our long-range financial target. Peter will have more to say about our financial outlook in just a few minutes.
On the integration front, we remain on course and continue to build momentum on multiple fronts. We have accomplished a lot in just six months. In the first quarter, we moved rapidly on executing our integration plans while maintaining our business momentum, growing the top line this quarter by 7%. We announced, with sanofi-aventis, our plan to create a global leader in Animal Health by combining Intervet/Schering-Plough with Merial into a proposed new joint venture that will equally be owned by Merck and sanofi-aventis. 
We completed the prioritization of R&D portfolio. Merck now has one of the industry's best pipelines, with more than 20 compounds in late-stage development. And we are well into the implementation of our previously announced global restructuring program. This includes the full integration of commercial operations in 12 out of our top 20 markets around the world.
I've also spent quite a bit of time in the past few months meeting with employees, customers and other key external stakeholders at various sites around the world, and what I saw was exciting. It is clear to me that there's considerable energy and disciplined thinking going on at Merck to ensure that we capture the many opportunities before us. Already, I am seeing signs of a more productive and sustainable culture beginning to emerge. We are intensely focused on what will add value, and most importantly, satisfy our customers' needs by providing them with innovative distinctive products and services that save and improve lives. And today, given our expanded worldwide presence and broader product portfolio, many more individuals have access to the valuable and diverse set of healthcare solution Merck provides than they did just a few months ago.
Turning to U.S. healthcare reform. While the legislation passed by Congress in March is not perfect, we continue to believe that overall, it will have a positive impact. Ultimately, the legislation passed will ensure that 32 million more Americans will have access to critical healthcare products and services. That's why we believe that healthcare reform, well not without its costs, will position Merck to better help patients to obtain the medicine and vaccine they need. For a company like Merck with a long history in vaccines, we are particularly pleased to see first dollar coverage of preventive services and vaccines for all new plans commencing in October 2010.
Also, defining the day exclusivity period for Biologics is 12 years will help protect innovation that our company has and will generate. I believe that protecting innovation goes hand-in-hand with expanding access to millions of Americans in need for healthcare, because our innovation can improve their care and reduce overall costs. We intend to remain on top of the issues related to healthcare reform and support our customers as we all navigate these significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.
No matter what challenges we may face from generic competition to the new requirements of healthcare reform, we are prepared to tackle them, because we understand it truly because to be the best healthcare company in the world, we must execute on many levels. We will continue to remain intensely focused throughout the rest of this year and beyond on executing our strategy, discovering new therapies, successfully launching new products and delivering growth from our in-line products throughout the world. At the same time, we remain committed to achieving our merger synergy target of $3.5 billion in annual savings in 2012. We look forward to telling you more about our accomplishments, our pipeline and our areas of opportunity next week at our R&D and business briefing. 
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to say a few words about the senior leadership announcements we've made last week. As you know, Ken was elected President of Merck with responsibility for our three largest operating divisions, Global Human Health, Merck Manufacturing division and Merck Research Laboratories. We also announced that Adam Schechter was elected to succeed Ken as President of Global Human Health. I'm very confident in Ken and Adam are the right leaders and that these changes further strengthen an already outstanding senior leadership team. As CEO and Chairman, I remain fully committed to Merck and with Ken, to steering the company through this critical post-merger launch phase and positioning us for success in the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

At the outset, please allow me to say that I am actually deeply, deeply honored to have been asked to serve in this new role. Because I believe still passionately in the company and its people and its mission. I look forward to working with you, Dick, Peter Kim, Willie Deese and all the rest of my senior management colleagues to help ensure that we deliver on the full promise of the merger and achieve sustainable performance going forward.
As Dick mentioned, we were off to a great start in 2010. Overall, Global Human Health delivered a strong quarter with sales of $9.8 billion, which represents 6% growth on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis from the previous year. In describing in our first quarter performance, please note that I will refer to supplemental combined non-GAAP results, which includes the impact of foreign exchange for the rest of my comments. 
While my focus today is to review the strong performance of the Global Human Health business during the first quarter, I do want to make a few comments about the focus and resilience our marketing and sales team showed in delivering these strong results. At the same time, we were integrating our operations and markets around the world.
As I shared with you during the fourth quarter call, we fully integrated our U.S. customer facing organization in January. And since then, we've made substantial progress in a number of other markets. As we integrated our customer facing groups, our primary focus was on minimizing customer disruption in order to maintain business momentum, while at the same time becoming both more effective and more efficient. 
Throughout the first quarter, our commercial teams around the world were required to take time off territory for brand and portfolio training as we merge the portfolios of the two legacy company. Nonetheless, I believe it is clear from the first quarter results that our sales force is focused on their customers and the new portfolio opportunities available to them. I think what our customer facing organization achieved was outstanding. Fully-integrated, trained, energized and refocused teams in a number of our major markets that delivered strong results.
We'll share additional insights into the progress we're making across the business next week during our R&D and business briefing meeting. For the rest of today's call, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter performance.
We drove growth and most of our markets and international sales grew at 10% in the first quarter. Taking a look at our largest market, we drove growth in nine of our top 10 country, and seven of the top 10 grew at double-digit rates. We also continued to see double-digit growth in our core emerging markets. We will discuss our emerging market strategy at the business briefing next week also.
Turning to individual brand performance. We continue to see broad-based growth with eight of our top 10 product families growing in the first quarter. As I address the individual product performance, you can feel free to follow along in Table 3 from our supplemental financial package. 
Starting with SINGULAIR, sales in the first quarter were $1.2 billion, an increase of 10% versus the prior year. SINGULAIR's growth was largely driven by strong performance in Japan and double-digit growth across the emerging markets. In the U.S., the allergy season in the first quarter was generally mild and comparable to the previous year. However, we started to see pollen counts intensified in late March. One of our main priorities following the close of the merger was to rapidly and effectively co-position the products in our respiratory portfolio. As the allergy season accelerated in March and April, our teams leverage our broad respiratory portfolio to drive volume growth. In addition to the growth of SINGULAIR, sales of NASONEX grew 4% to $320 million, driven by results in the EU, Japan and the emerging markets.
Moving to JANUVIA and JANUMET, global revenue grew 32% to a combined $172 million (sic) [$712 million]. The JANUVIA franchise continues its strong performance, despite the introduction of new branded competition and the continued utilization of generics, because JANUVIA has a differentiated label and brings real benefit to patients with type 2 diabetes. Sales in the U.S. grew 16% this quarter. We continue to invest in the promotion of JANUVIA and JANUMET to maintain our leadership position in the diabetes market and to grow this franchise.
We are focused on highlighting the strong value proposition of JANUVIA versus sulfonylurea. We also plan to capitalize on the new label changes for JANUVIA, which includes the label changed to allow use with insulin. We believe this represents a significant opportunity for growth and differentiation going forward. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to see growth in the EU, and the launch of JANUVIA in Japan is tracking well. Due to the strong product profile and significant labeling advantages, we expect that this franchise will continue to be a major growth driver for Merck. 
Our immunology franchise also achieved strong growth during the quarter. REMICADE continues to be a leading immunologic therapy. Sales in the quarter were $674 million, an increase of 30% from the previous year. REMICADE continues to deliver growth across all indications rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. 
In rheumatology, REMICADE is maintaining its market share despite multiple new product launches in the class. In fact, we're seeing some benefit in REMICADE's performance from the launch of SIMPONI which I'll discuss shortly. REMICADE's market share and growth in the GI indications remains class leading. 
In April, the New England Journal of Medicine published the Sonic study. Sonic showed that patients with Crohn's disease were more likely to achieve steroid free clinical remission with REMICADE compared to patients taking azathioprine. 
Moving to SIMPONI, while we're still in the early stages of the launches, we are encouraged by the quick adoption in key markets where we have reimbursement. We are driving SIMPONI primarily to take share from Humira and Enbrel, not REMICADE. In addition to the five countries where we currently have reimbursement, we plan to launch SIMPONI in many of the other EU markets and key emerging markets in the second half of this year. We continue to view REMICADE and SIMPONI as significant growth drivers.
Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN. Sales were $1 billion this quarter, which in the aggregate, represents 2% growth compared to the previous year. Sales in the U.S. declined due to market share erosion and movement in inventory. VYTORIN and ZETIA remain a key focus of our promotional efforts this year. We continue to see solid growth in many markets outside the U.S. and are encouraged by the performance of our teams in the EU and Japan.
Moving on to COZAAR/HYZAAR. As you know, the brands recently lost marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and most major EU markets. Globally, sales in the first quarter were down 7%. Recent weekly prescription data in the U.S. indicates that there has been a rapid erosion of the brands now that we are no longer enjoying market exclusivity. I will now move to our Vaccine business.
In the first quarter, the Vaccine business benefited from an inventory build of approximately $75 million to $100 million. First quarter sales of ZOSTAVAX, as reported by Merck, were $95 million, a 27% increase from the previous year. We did see an inventory build due to the timing of customer orders in the first quarter. While demand remains high for ZOSTAVAX, we continue to be constrained by supply. 
Moving to GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the first quarter were $233 million, an 11% decline. GARDASIL continues to maintain market share leadership in the U.S. and also remains the global market leader. 
In infectious diseases, ISENTRESS continues its outstanding launch performance and is now one of Merck's top 10 brand. Sales in the first quarter were $232 million, an increase of 57%. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and tolerability profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations.
In closing, I want to thank my colleagues across the new Merck for a successful quarter. Since the close of the merger, I've spent a great deal of time with our teams and our customers around the world in the U.S., Latin America, U.K., Greece, Italy, Switzerland and other places. 
And while growing our business, in the midst of integration was an enormous challenge, the progress and enthusiasm of our teams to build a new commercial organization that embodies the best of legacy Schering-Plough and Merck commercial organizations with minimal customer disruption was truly a tribute to the organization's focus and execution. 
I look forward to updating you all on our progress during the business briefing next week. We've had another strong quarter, and I think our review of the business will help you better appreciate exactly what is driving this success. 
And so now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."
288502,100502857,59339,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and our integration efforts are well underway. Ken shared with you how our key brands contributed to our strong growth this quarter. I w",1484,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and our integration efforts are well underway. Ken shared with you how our key brands contributed to our strong growth this quarter. I would like to cover two areas with you. First, our earnings performance this quarter and second, I will provide some commentary on our targets for full year 2010 and beyond that, our long-term EPS target. 
Let's begin with our results. This is the first quarter that we are reporting a full three months of results for the combined company. You'll see the tables in our news release and supplemental charts that we added last quarter to help you navigate through our non-GAAP adjustments to the P&L, which exclude purchase price accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges and a $150 million tax charge related to elimination of a tax benefit for retiree prescription drug coverage. To simplify my remarks today, I will speak mostly to the non-GAAP results. On this basis, the new Merck reported first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83.
Our performance this quarter is characterized by the strong operational sales that Ken just discussed. The cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base, lower equity income from partnerships, due to the elimination of Merial and the cholesterol joint venture and lower interest income and higher interest expense due to the merger financing. 
In addition, we also had about a 4% benefit from foreign exchange on the top line, which also had the effect of increasing our operating expenses. So let's get into some of the individual items beginning with revenue. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $11.4 billion. On a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, sales were up 7%. This basis assumes that Schering-Plough and the cholesterol joint venture were included for all three months of the first quarter of 2009 as well. Our Global Human Health business grew 6% in the quarter. Our Animal business grew 14% to $709 million, reflecting continued growth among companion animal and poultry products. Meanwhile, our Consumer Care sales were $379 million, slightly lower than prior year due to the launch purchases of Claritin Liqui-Gels in the first quarter of 2009. 
Now moving on to the expense side in the P&L. As you know, our cost base now includes the cost from Schering-Plough, Merck and the cholesterol joint venture, whereas only the Merck costs were included in the first quarter of 2009, so it's a little hard to see underlying trends. So this quarter though, we reduced our headcount, we generated savings from procurement actions and discontinued certain R&D projects through our pipeline prioritization process. As a result of these and other actions, we are on track to realize our $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. Over time, I am confident that you will see even more evidence that our costs are coming down. 
So let's move on to materials and production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was approximately 75%, which was similar to the rate in the first quarter of 2009 when Merck was a stand-alone company. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $3.2 billion. While research and development expenses for the first quarter were approximately $2 billion, slightly lower than we expected. Included in the R&D expenses this quarter was continued investment in late-stage projects, such as TRA [thrombin receptor antagonist], boceprevir,  [indiscernible] (40:05), CORDAPTIVE and our CETP-Inhibitor. 
Let's move to equity income. In the first quarter, Merck recorded $138 million of equity income, a $450 million decline over the prior year. This decline is primarily attributable to the unwind of the cholesterol joint venture and the sale of Merial. There was also a $43 million decline in income from the AZLP partnership. Now as you're aware, AstraZeneca gave us notice that their intent to exercise their option to buy the non-PPI products, which will result in a one-time gain of approximately $440 million in the second quarter. This gain will not be included in our non-GAAP results. 
Going forward, Merck equity income will be earned from three partnerships AZLP, our vaccine joint venture with sanofi in Europe, and the J&J Merck OTC partnership. Beginning in 2011, we expect to also have equity income from our new Animal Health joint venture once it is completed. Until that time, we continue to own and consolidate the interventuring Plough business in our full P&L. This quarter's equity income is a good barometer of the anticipated quarterly equity income in 2010. 
Now let's discuss other income and expense. In the first quarter of 2010, other expense on a non-GAAP basis is $160 million compared to other income of $80 million in the first quarter of 2009. There are a few items driving this year-over-year change. First, and most notably, is the inclusion of interest expense from the Schering-Plough debt and the merger related debt. Second, interest income was lower as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances. Third, the current quarter's expense includes an $80 million exchange loss, as a result of the currency devaluation in Venezuela, and the translation of assets in Venezuela on our balance sheet. Lastly, a favorable settlement of a dispute contributed approximately $100 million to the line.
Moving to the tax line. The new Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 23% for the first quarter. This is consistent with the rate that we saw in 2009 on a full year basis, excluding discrete items. So that's the first quarter, a strong start for the new Merck. 
Now let's talk about our financial targets beginning with our long-term targets. We remain very excited about the future of the new Merck and we continue to target a high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 regardless of the outcome of the REMICADE arbitration. As we indicated in our press release on April 23, this guidance is also still applicable, despite the anticipated impacts from healthcare reform. 
So specifically in 2010, the company is targeting a full year 2010 non-GAAP EPS range of $3.27 to $3.41 excluding certain items. On a GAAP basis, we are targeting an EPS range of $1.15 to $1.50. We have also provided guidance on the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Page 3 of our news release.  Our 2010 EPS target and other financial targets assume that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. 
Now I'd like to provide targets in a few select areas to help you better understand the earnings targets. First, beginning with the sales line. We are launching an impressive number of new products globally, and we anticipate that sales from these new products, combined with strong growth in our key brands JANUVIA, ISENTRESS, REMICADE and SINGULAIR will replace the significant sales loss from patent expiry of this year. 
COZAAR/HYZAAR would represent the third major patent expiry after ZOCOR in 2006 and FOSAMAX in 2008, that Merck has grown through in the years of expiry. We anticipate full year 2010 sales to be in the range of $45.4 billion to $46.4 billion at current exchange rates. This range reflects the unfavorable $170 million impact from the healthcare reform as previously discussed on April 23. Now let's discuss R&D.
In 2010, we will continue to invest in our late-stage pipeline. We are also driving efficiencies through the combined R&D  infrastructure. We anticipate full year non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion. 
Moving to the tax line, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 22% to 24% in 2010. So let me summarize. We are pleased with our strong first quarter results. We clearly had a stronger-than-expected first quarter, and our expense management contributed to that performance. Three other factors contributed to our strong first quarter performance. First, we had about $75 million to $100 million in U.S. inventory build in the vaccines area. Second, our R&D expenses were lower than expected, due to timing of clinical trials. We do expect to make up that spending in subsequent quarters of 2010 and currently target R&D expenses of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion that I just mentioned, which implies higher quarterly spending going forward. Finally, foreign exchange gave us a lift this quarter, and we don't expect the same degree of benefit going forward based on current ForEx rates. 
Our results and the targets provided demonstrate that we are on track, had a good first full year as a combined company. We expect to continue our business momentum for key brands, launch products globally and make significant investments in our promising late-stage pipeline, and we expect to realize substantial cost synergies. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back over to Alex. Alex?"

Some of it",541,"This is Peter. So the first quarter, obviously, we did a little better than we thought, and some of the factors that I mentioned were net build in our U.S. vaccines inventory out in the channels and that was to a multitude of different effects. Some of it was the fact that we were seeing some increased customer purchasing of vaccines, because we're going live on SAP in the beginning of April. Some of it was actually some advance purchasing of ZOSTAVAX due to some concerns about the fact that we'd mentioned there might be some back orders and so people were picking up some inventory. And probably we would expect that not to be sustained as we go forward. So in the second quarter, you'd probably see that balance out. We don't have a perfect crystal ball on that, but it would be reasonable for that, I think. The second thing is as I mentioned, the R&D expenses were a little lower than we would've expected, but really everything's still moving ahead. I just think that we maybe didn't quite get the exact calendarization rate. We did give you the full year guidance or target of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion. And obviously, the math would tell you that that implies higher quarter spending going forward. And then  third, we got a nice benefit from foreign exchange in the first quarter, which I don't think we'll get quite as much of going forward in the balance of the year. In fact, I think the foreign exchange rates are moving a little bit as we speak. And obviously that's a volatile state in [ph] rate now. I think that, obviously, we do have some seasonality in our revenue, and I think that probably that will cause the second half of the year to look a little stronger. And likewise, we're seeing COZAAR/HYZAAR, as we mentioned earlier, went off patent so that's really, as Ken mentioned, start to have a very strong impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And what we you mentioned in the Q4 call was that we did see that the second half of the year be a little bit stronger than the first half, and we do think that continues to be true from a calendarization standpoint. Longer-term basis, we haven't guided to revenue. We've focused on EPS as obviously a lot of moving parts here, and so I don't want to just kind of quickly give guidance that showing on the revenue line. I think that obviously everyone knows where clearly what all of the moving parts are and we're launching a lot of products. We've got a lot of exciting late stage pipeline items. We've got some in-line commercial asset, as Ken's talked about, have tremendous potential so exactly where those land, it's hard to call. Going against that, obviously, we're in a challenging global economy right now with a lot of fiscal budgets and governments trying to manage through that. So at this point, what we do know is we have the right levers in place through putting these two companies together to manage the EPS guidance, we think we're in very good shape on that. Dick or Ken, do you want to add anything?"

So we did highlight that foreign exchange do give us a benefit this quarter and base on the current rates, we don't expect the same benefit going forward as we go through sequential quarters and that is obviously comparing to prior year.

So we have to take that all into account and that's the basis that we were saying. I think mostly that would be thinking about the current rates that are out there in terms of how we think about the outlook. In terms of hedging, we do have -- as you know, the two companies do have slightly different programs. As the merger took place, we have thought about how we put that together and I think you will see that we'll continue to use hedging as one of the tools to help us manage the business. We had about a $200 million favorable impact from foreign exchange this quarter and included a benefit from hedging of about $50 million. And so there have been some changes at the company together [ph] in terms of how we run that program. It's fairly technically really so it provides [indiscernible] too meaningful from an investor standpoint. But we do continue to believe that the hedging program is helpful to reduce the impact of unfavorable changes, taking the short term, bopping around on foreign exchange as well at because it's more of a longer term stability to devalue the U.S. dollar performance.

Our strong bottom line performance in the second quarter demonstrates Merck's continued success in executing our post-merger strategy. We're now halfway through our first full year as a combined company. Already, we're seeing positive signs of what can be achieved. Despite patent expiries and a challenging economy, I'm very pleased with what our team has accomplished. 
We remain focused on driving revenue growth, maintaining the momentum of our business, reducing our cost structure and making the right strategic investments globally. All of which are allowing us to make good progress toward Merck's overall goal of becoming the best healthcare company in the world. Strong underlying product performance helped us to realize topline worldwide sales of $11.3 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter. 
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, ISENTRESS and TEMODAR were again standouts this quarter. In addition, Animal Health and Merck Consumer Care produced strong global sales. With our strong performance for the first half of the year, we continued to have confidence in delivering on our long-term financial targets. We also remain committed to achieving our previously-announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in ongoing annual savings in 2012. 
We have already announced initial phases of the merger restructuring program that will contribute approximately $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion toward the overall target, with procurement savings in excess contagious [ph] to account for the rest. 
In a few moments, Ken will discuss in more detail our global product performance, and then Peter will discuss our full year earnings outlook. But first, let me highlight a few areas. 
Merck's integration remains very much on course. But it will involve more hard work and difficult decisions as we proceed forward with our efforts to capture the full value of the new Merck for patients, customers and shareholders. The announcements we made recently did tell them the plans to integrate Merck's global research and manufacturing operations is another key step, but not the final one, in successfully executing our overall plan to create an industry-leading operating model. 
On the R&D side, our goal is to create a more flexible organization that fuels innovation in our pipeline and excels at external collaboration. On the manufacturing side, we aim to have a more reliable cost-efficient worldwide supply chain to support Merck's broader product portfolio, and meet the demand of a diverse and ever-revolving global health care environment. And while there are still lots of moving parts, we are building our strong track record of quickly executing our integration plans, while launching new products and delivering strong performance from current months. That has what allowed us to drive revenue growth in key brands despite patent expiries and difficult economic conditions. 
In markets around the world, we simultaneously have launches underway for a range of products including SIMPONI in 10 markets, and JANUVIA in Japan and in India. Additionally, our latest asthma dedication, DULERA, was recently approved by the U.S. FDA, and we've begun its launch. 
As we shared with many of you during our R&D Day in May, we also have several falling under late-stage review in the EU. From our robust pipeline, we anticipate making about 20 filings for new compounds and new combinations between now and 2012, including boceprevir, vorapaxar, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE in the U.S. 
We also remain well positioned in Animal Health, a business that is driven by growing demand for animal proteins, as well as a strong demand for companion animal healthcare. We are on track to bring together sanofi-aventis and our Animal Health businesses into a new joint venture that will create a new global leader in Animal Health. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be excited about the many opportunities before us to serve the rapidly expanding emerging markets. Throughout these markets, I believe we continue to position Merck well by launching new products and making targeted business development investments. 
Examples of our commitment and execution can be found in high-growth markets like China and South Africa. In South Africa, we have a newly formed strategic collaboration with a local partner, Adcock Ingram. Together, we will co-promote and distribute branded products as well as over-the-counter medications. This collaboration will extend our reach into the market. 
Earlier this month, Merck's executive committee members and I spent a busy week in China. It has become one of our most important markets. Providing needed medicine and vaccines to meet the expanding needs of Chinese patients is an exciting growth opportunity for us. So we are focused on building our capabilities in China including our local production capabilities, our product portfolio and R&D. 
As part of our expansion efforts, we recently unveiled joint venture plan with Sinopharm to manufacture and commercialize adult and pediatric vaccines in China, and announced plans for a manufacturing site in Hangzhou, where we'll invest to build local capacity. I've seen firsthand the excitement and hard work underway in our emerging markets around the world, with China being the most recent example. That's why I am confident that we will reach our goal of deriving 25% of our global pharmaceutical and vaccine revenue from emerging markets in 2013. 
Merck's commitment to improving health around the world is not new to us. This commitment dates back decades and most recently, was recognized by the Access to Medicine Index. Merck was ranked second in the global analysis of companies that are making their medicines and vaccines readily available to markets across all income levels. All of these actions support Merck's mission to help patients around the world and to maximize shareholder return by providing innovative medicines, vaccines and consumer and Animal Health products, globally. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken"
288502,108814676,70844,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our secon",1726,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our second quarter performance, please note that I will refer to supplemental combined non-GAAP results, which include the impact of foreign exchange. 
The Global Human Health business delivered a solid quarter with sales of $9.8 billion. This represents a 2% decline on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis from the previous year, largely due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR especially in the U.S. If you've been following the weekly prescription trends, then you have seen that there has been rapid erosion of approximately 90% of branded COZAAR and HYZAAR prescription volume in the U.S. Other markets such as the U.K. and Italy have also experienced rapid erosion. 
Excluding the impact of COZAAR and HYZAAR, Global Human Health sales grew 3% year-over-year. Sales were driven by the robust operational growth of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, TEMODAR and ISENTRESS. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for these brands. The speed with which we integrated our commercial operations, the diversity of our portfolio and the underlying strength of our global business have been key factors in our successful start to the first half of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to drive growth in many of our markets. International Human Health sales grew by 5% excluding COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our Emerging Markets business grew 12% in the second quarter. We spent a fair amount of time during the business briefing in May discussing our strategy and goals in the emerging markets. As we said then, we believe these markets will grow to represent more than a quarter of our pharmaceutical and vaccine sales by 2013. 
In the second quarter, the emerging markets accounted for 19% of our human health sales. Two of the emerging markets, China and Brazil, are quickly working their way up our list of top 10 markets. Sales in China and Brazil both grew by more than 15% in the quarter. We continue to expect to have significant future growth opportunities across the emerging markets. 
We are well-positioned to drive significant growth with our current portfolio of products, including JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, as well as branded generics like COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as ZOCOR. We are also exploring multiple strategies to increase our share in the branded generic and patent-protected segments through value-creating partnerships and acquisitions. 
Dick mentioned some of the recent developments in China, including the recent letter of mutual agreement with Sinopharm to develop a joint venture to commercialize pediatric and adult vaccines in China, a very large potential market. 
Now turning to the performance of some of our key brands this quarter. As I drop the individual product performance, you can follow along in Table 3 from our supplemental financial package, as Alex said earlier. Starting with our respiratory franchise, SINGULAIR sales in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, comparable to the second quarter 2009. This year, the spring allergy season peaked early in the U.S. and was overall comparable to the 2009 season. Sales in the U.S. this quarter were also affected by unfavorable fluctuations in trade inventory. Double-digit growth of SINGULAIR in the emerging markets was offset by declines in Japan due to the timing of shipments to our partner. 
For NASONEX, global sales increased 5% driven by the strong growth in the U.S. and Japan. Despite the flat year-over-year comparisons for the allergy season in the U.S., sales of NASONEX grew in the U.S. by 7%. NASONEX continues to be the leading branded nasal-inhaled steroid, and now includes additional congestion labeling in the U.S.  In Japan, we've had robust growth since the launch, and NASONEX is now the market leader. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 33% to a combined $818 million. The JANUVIA franchise continues to perform strongly in terms of share and overall growth. Sales in the quarter were driven by double-digit growth across all markets. In Japan, where we recently launched JANUVIA, sales were $69 million, which included supply sales to our partner of about $40 million. We've seen strong initial response to the value proposition JANUVIA represents to Japanese physicians and patients. 
Our Immunology franchise also achieved strong growth during the quarter. REMICADE continues to be a leading immunological therapy with sales of $669 million, an increase of 18% from the previous year. REMICADE continues to deliver growth across all indications, rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. We anticipate REMICADE's double-digit operational growth will continue throughout 2010. 
In addition, sales of SIMPONI were $18 million in the quarter. SIMPONI sales continue to grow as we launch the brand in more countries and take share from other subcutaneous anti-TNF. We've now launched and 10 countries, most recently in Spain. We will launch SIMPONI in other EU markets in the second half of 2010 and launches in the U.K. and France are planned for 2011. 
Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, which in the aggregate represents a 3% decline compared to the previous year primarily due to declines in the U.S. Sequentially, ZETIA and VYTORIN grew 4%, globally. ZETIA and VYTORIN remain a primary focus of our promotional efforts, and we continue to see solid growth in many markets around the world, including 28% year-over-year growth in Japan. We continue to make progress on the IMPROVE-IT study, which is now fully enrolled with over 18,000 patients. 
Moving on to vaccines. For the total Vaccine business, I will focus my comments on sequential comparisons. Total sales for the Vaccine business were $832 million in the second quarter compared to $846 million in the first quarter of 2010. As a reminder, vaccine sales in the first quarter benefited from a $75 million to $100 million inventory build. With that in mind, we had some bright spots in the second quarter specifically with respect to RotaTeq, which benefited from a temporary competitor supply issue and PNEUMOVAX. This, unfortunately, was offset by weaker ZOSTAVAX sales due to supply constraints and the ongoing backorders for the brand. This is a frustrating situation for our teams, our customers and patients. And we have dedicated several hundred engineers and researchers to getting it fixed. We continue to work to resolve our current supply issues and to create redundant capacity in our facilities in North Carolina and Ireland. However, we do expect sales to be negatively affected by the supply issue again in the third quarter this year. 
Moving to GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the second quarter were $219 million, an 18% decline from the previous year. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales grew sequentially by 5%. We've made good progress with the coverage prevails [ph] and funding is now secured for all states. GARDASIL continues to maintain market share leadership in the U.S., and it also remains the global market leader. 
In Infectious Diseases, ISENTRESS continues its outstanding performance as sales increased 55% to $267 million in the second quarter. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and tolerability profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations around the world. 
While many of our brands reported positive growth trends in the EU during the second quarter, the environment in the EU and across Europe is now more challenging. Many countries have announced austerity measures aimed at reducing costs in areas such as healthcare. While the implementation of pricing actions varies by country, many have announced measures to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs. 
In the short term, we've worked with many of the industry groups and governments to help develop solutions for our customers to improve their budget positions and address the short-term economic issues. While we are taking steps to mitigate the immediate impact in the EU, we anticipate that the austerity measures will affect our revenue performance going forward.  Peter Kellogg will focus on the financial impact of the EU austerity measures in his remarks shortly. 
Moving from the economic environment, I'd like to highlight briefly some recent developments from three of our key R&D programs: DULERA, vorapaxar and boceprevir. As you know, we're in the process of launching many new products this year and we have robust late-stage pipeline with programs that represent significant scientific achievements and first-in-class opportunities. 
In June, as Dick mentioned, we received U.S. FDA approval of DULERA, our combination steroid and long-acting beta agonist for the treatment of asthma. Despite the availability of other combination treatments, there remains some large unmet need in asthma, and we believe DULERA represents a great alternative due to its differentiated profile, which includes the addition of clinically-judged deteriorations in asthma within its label. We are beginning the launch of DULERA now with plans for a full commercial launch late in the third quarter. 
Our Phase III program for vorapaxar, our PAR-1 inhibitor for the prevention of major cardiovascular events is also progressing well. Both Phase III studies are now fully enrolled. The TRA 2P study in secondary prevention is fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. The TRA-CER study in patients with acute coronary syndrome is also fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. 
Based on current event rates, we anticipate that both studies will be completed in mid-2011. We are pleased with the progress in the Phase III program. Most importantly, we continue to target a 2011 filings for vorapaxar.
Turning to boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor, I'm pleased to share with you that both Phase III studies are now completed, and we're in the process of analyzing the results. We plan to submit the Phase III data for presentation at the AASLD meeting in November.  Finally, we remain on track to file boceprevir in 2010. 
In closing, Global Human Health, along with Animal Health and Consumer Health Care, have delivered another solid quarter for Merck. We continue to be excited by our portfolio of products and our robust late-stage pipeline. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we continue to execute on our long-term strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company. Now I will pass the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."
288502,108814676,70844,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway.

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway. Our performance this quarter is characterized by solid operational performance, which was tampered by the impact of generic entries for COZAAR and HYZAAR and the cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and geographies performed. And now I'd like to cover three areas with you: First, our operating results; second, our restructuring activities; and third, I want to discuss our targets for full year 2010 and beyond. 
So let's begin with our results. As Alex mentioned, we have once again provided data in our earnings release and supplemental charts to help navigate through our non-GAAP adjustments to the P&L. To simplify my remarks today, I will speak the non-GAAP results, which exclude purchase price accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges and the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise. 
On this basis, we reported second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion. On a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, sales were down 2% versus prior year due primarily to the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and lower Astra supply sale due to the generic erosion and return of rights to the non-PPI products. These offset solid operational growth in the rest of the business. Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. 
Our Animal Health business grew 9% to $731 million, reflecting growth among cattle, poultry and swine products. We remain on track to complete our Animal Health joint venture with sanofi-aventis in the first quarter of 2011. Consumer Care sales increased 11% to $422 million due to the strong seasonal performance of Claritin and Coppertone. 
Now moving on to the expense items in the P&L. You can see that we did a very good job managing our expenses this quarter in anticipation of additional commercial launches and spending on our late-stage pipeline expected during third and fourth quarter. As you know, the cost of our combined company are represented in our current cost base, whereas only the Merck costs were included in the second quarter of 2009. So it's a little hard to see the underlying trends on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to sequential trends on the cost lines since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
Let's begin with the materials in production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was approximately 76.5%, which is an improvement compared to the first quarter of 2010 where the gross margin was 75.4%. Most of the improvement in the gross margin was driven by product mix, with higher sequential sales of JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and increased sales of seasonal allergy products. 
Moving onto marketing and admin expenses, on an on-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $3.1 billion, which is about the same level as in the first quarter of 2010. Research and development expenses for the second quarter was approximately $2 billion, which is also in line with the first quarter. As the year progresses, we see continued investment in late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the second quarter, Merck reported $43 million of equity income, which was a decrease from the first quarter primarily due to inherent variability and the timing of payments for the AstraZeneca joint venture. 
Moving on to other income and expense. The GAAP results include $443 million from AstraZeneca's exercise of the asset option. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $153 million was comparable to the first quarter of 2010. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the second quarter, better than the rate that we saw in the first quarter. As noted in the earnings release, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $1.3 billion to repurchase about 38 million shares of our common stock.  So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since merger. 
Now let's talk about the integration activities. This quarter, we made continued progress on our cost synergy capture by reducing our headcount in global infrastructure and generating savings from procurement actions. On July 8, we announced our plans to phase out operations at eight manufacturing facilities and eight research facilities over the next two years. The merger restructuring program also includes consolidating our sites in local markets by closing 58 commercial offices. The actions we have announced so far will bring our number of R&D sites down to 16 and our number of our manufacturing sites down to 48, excluding Animal Health sites. 
We will continue to pursue productivity efficiencies and evaluate our manufacturing supply-chain capabilities on an ongoing basis. Remember, we are planning to create a new Animal Health joint venture, so our Animal Health business is not involved in the Merck merger researching activities. As a result of these and other actions such as procurement savings, we are well on track to realize a $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. 
Now let's spend the remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond that. Let's start with 2010. With the first six months complete, it's appropriate to provide an update on our earnings targets. We have maintained $3.34 as the midpoint of our range while tightening the EPS range for the full year. Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 non-GAAP EPS range of $3.29 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Factored into this target EPS range is our strong first quarter results, continued benefits from synergies in the second half, the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous comments, and the assumption that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. 
In addition, we have assumed top line pressures due to pricing actions in some European countries and foreign exchange, both of which we believe will be a headwind in the second half. In addition, we anticipate increased second half spending for new product launches like DULERA in the U.S., new targeted commercial and R&D investments in the emerging markets and spending to support the late-stage pipeline. 
Let me go into a bit more detail to help you understand what is already factored in to the 2010 targets. As you know, and as Ken mentioned, Greece, Spain, Germany and some other markets have already announced price reductions, which will have an unfavorable impact on our results in the third and fourth quarter of 2010. The impact on European revenues in the first half was about 2% unfavorable. In the second half, we anticipate a mid single-digit unfavorable impact on European sales. 
These updates are included in our 2010 targets and will impact our second half performance relative to what we were modeling at the beginning of the year. As a result, we now expect that EPS in the second half will be similar to the level in the first half. So you should adjust your models accordingly. Logically, these actions in 2010 will also have an impact in 2011 as they annualize. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about the future of the new Merck, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities that are already well underway. We continue to target a high single-digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013. 
In closing, we are pleased with the solid second quarter results we reported today. We clearly had a strong first half. Our expense management contributed to that performance and will help us manage a tighter environment in Europe. The merger is working, and our results and our short-term and long-term earnings targets demonstrate that we are right on track. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex."

I think from our perspective, I think it's important to recognize that we always study TRA and always anticipated that it would be added to the standard of care whether it was aspirin, PLAVIX or another medicine in PLAVIX class. So it was always our intent to have it added on top of the standard of care. And so we would think that it would be added on to Belinta [ph] as that became approved at some point and became a competitor of PLAVIX. I also think it's important to recognize that even with the, for example, 16% increase, a great deal of residual risk still remains, cardiovascular risk still remains. And therefore, there's still an important role for medicine like TRA. I also think it's important to remember the product profile, which includes the fact that we have not seen any increase in bleeding unlike some of the other medicines that are being used. So for all of these reasons, I continue to think that there are really robust prospects for our medicine like TRA."

I think the issue, as Ken mentioned, is that we've put significant amount of technical and engineering resources on this both from a manufacturing and a research standpoint, and certainly, right now we are cautiously optimistic. We have begun production again of varicella. We believe that by starting production, we have a path forward. So that's good news. It's not going to have an impact on 2010 forecast because the product process cycle is significant, so there's many more production steps to go through yet. There's more quality testing to go through. There's more discussions with the agencies to go through. But I am cautiously optimistic due to the fact that, obviously, we've started production that is important. Now the second important aspect is, as Ken mentioned, is that we've started our focus on Durham, and we hope to have that, from a production standpoint, up and running in the second half of this year. And from a pediatric standpoint, with the relaunch of COMVAX, our HIB and Hepatitis B combination vaccines, all of Merck pediatric vaccines will be available in U.S. for the first time since mid-2007. So we are making that type of progress, but we'll keep our fingers crossed on ZOSTAVAX because we did start production again."

Let me just start by saying that I think we continue to be very excited about the future in China. To look at China in a monolithic way as it relates to pricing or any other aspect of our commercial strategy, I think is not how we are going to approach it. So let's start with the robust growth that we anticipate in the middle class in the urban areas of China. For those people, healthcare is still likely to be a self-pay exercise, and so we will continue to look at those market segments in a way that we can price competitively with alternative therapies. But I will say that the pricing in China has allowed both a broad access, while at the same time, also allowing strong profit margins in that country. I think the other aspect is through the government. And so there's an essential drug list, which is part of Chinese healthcare reform, and Merck participated in the Essential Drug List placing ZOCOR among other magazines on that drug list. And our experience there has been that while we had to provide substantial discounts to get entree to the Essential Drug List, the volumes have more than compensated for the pricing reductions that we have. So I think what we've seen with ZOCOR right now is an example of how in that market, we have the price in a way that creates value for that market and there's still an opportunity to be profitable in that context."

So we really maintain the midpoint of our guidance range and EPS. Obviously, we have, as I commented and as you pointed out, we've taken into account some of the top line pressures we see in the balance of the year. Obviously, we do expect to see the pricing impact in the second half of the year. The way we look at it, it's about mid single-digit range impact on the European revenues. Translating that to the top line, it's probably in the neighborhood of, I'm guessing, it's about $300 million or so. And obviously, we have to fully annualize that next year. The other thing is, obviously, Forex. Now the impact of Forex for us is a little complex because obviously, you have the Forex impact around the world, not just euro but yen and other currencies. And you have to net that against our hedge program. We anticipate in the second half of the year currency being a slight negative on our top line, probably something in the 1%, 2% range kind of as you go through the second half of the year. Obviously, those rates still move around. So those are the primary factors in addition to the healthcare reform. So that said, going the other way, we have a lot of activity on the expense line in the second half that will actually be driving our business going forward. And as we go into 2011, we'll be launching DULERA, we have a lot of activity going on in Japan, launching products, having a lot of success. We will be, obviously, investing in the emerging markets as you've seen announcements, and we'll continue to grow there. And obviously, our pipeline, which is a big driver for us in the future, continues to move forward with very nice progress. So you can expect to see some spending in that in the second half, a little more in the first half. So all those points combine to lead us to our guidance.

But if you go back to why this is such an important merger to the company, it's far beyond the cost synergies. Cost synergies, in many cases, is an afterthought to why we did this merger and why we're still excited about it. First of all, the most important aspect of this merger that we continue to be excited upon is that it's a late-stage pipeline, and the research synergies from the standpoint that you're -- you have complementary franchises, and there's not much overlap and mechanism of actions, and there's great scientific and technological sharing out that is just so important for the future of the company. So the first and foremost reason why this makes sense moving forward is the scientific and research pipeline and the scientific and research technology that we're sharing across mutual franchises as we move forward. The second part to that is the product portfolio. The excitement that we see from our professional reps country-by-country when we visit there about having now a combined portfolio that can really come up with the right resolution for patients and physicians is just incredible. We're no longer a one trick pony when it comes to some franchises or to these states. We have a portfolio that can meet their needs, and I think that capability is extremely important. And then third, I think is the geographical footprint we have. The geographical footprint that we combined with the two companies, as you know, is critical to the future since we're not and will not be a U.S.-centric company. So when you look at all of those evaluations, to us, those are the most important.

So that's where we are on that issue. On the branded generics issue, as Dick mentioned before, I think it does vary very much market-by-market. But I want to start by saying, we have a very substantial branded generics business right now inside the company, with over 150 products available in the emerging markets based on previous portfolios of the two companies. And we see brands, as I mentioned, like ZOCOR in China just growing phenomenally. So what we intend to do is we intend to look at the branded generics business on a country-by-country basis, look at the opportunities to expand on the current portfolio of products that we have of both our traditional established products as well as our innovative products, and we intend to build on those in ways that create value for customers as well as for our shareholders."

We're investing in it as we move forward. And obviously, outside the U.S. as well there's an Rx-to-OTC switch capability, which is also important. And there's a synergy where you can use some of the shared services capabilities between the Global Human Health division as well as the Merck Consumer Care division to get some costs synergies at the same time. So it's an important part of our future moving forward. And as you know, some of the products have lives of their own.

We excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation table, so you can get a better sense of the underlying performance for the quarter. We've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. 
So this quarter, there are three tables in the press release. Table #1 is the GAAP results. Table #2 is a reconciliation of our GAAP results to a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter and also for the year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for our products and our businesses, as if the company have been combined in 2009. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we discuss the product performance. So you may want to have those available.

Such statements are based upon the current beliefs  of Merck's management and subject to significant risks and uncertainties. 
Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements we make today. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement.

Our strong bottom line performance in the second quarter demonstrates Merck's continued success in executing our post-merger strategy. We're now halfway through our first full year as a combined company. Already, we're seeing positive signs of what can be achieved. Despite patent expiries and a challenging economy, I'm very pleased with what our team has accomplished. 
We remain focused on driving revenue growth, maintaining the momentum of our business, reducing our cost structure and making the right strategic investments globally. All of which are allowing us to make good progress toward Merck's overall goal of becoming the best healthcare company in the world. Strong underlying product performance helped us to realize topline worldwide sales of $11.3 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter. 
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, ISENTRESS and TEMODAR were again standouts this quarter. In addition, Animal Health and Merck Consumer Care produced strong global sales. With our strong performance for the first half of the year, we continued to have confidence in delivering on our long-term financial targets. We also remain committed to achieving our previously-announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in ongoing annual savings in 2012. 
We have already announced initial phases of the merger restructuring program that will contribute approximately $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion toward the overall target, with procurement savings in excess contagious [ph] to account for the rest. 
In a few moments, Ken will discuss in more detail our global product performance, and then Peter will discuss our full year earnings outlook. But first, let me highlight a few areas. 
Merck's integration remains very much on course. But it will involve more hard work and difficult decisions as we proceed forward with our efforts to capture the full value of the new Merck for patients, customers and shareholders. The announcements we made recently did tell them the plans to integrate Merck's global research and manufacturing operations is another key step, but not the final one, in successfully executing our overall plan to create an industry-leading operating model. 
On the R&D side, our goal is to create a more flexible organization that fuels innovation in our pipeline and excels at external collaboration. On the manufacturing side, we aim to have a more reliable cost-efficient worldwide supply chain to support Merck's broader product portfolio, and meet the demand of a diverse and ever-revolving global health care environment. And while there are still lots of moving parts, we are building our strong track record of quickly executing our integration plans, while launching new products and delivering strong performance from current months. That has what allowed us to drive revenue growth in key brands despite patent expiries and difficult economic conditions. 
In markets around the world, we simultaneously have launches underway for a range of products including SIMPONI in 10 markets, and JANUVIA in Japan and in India. Additionally, our latest asthma dedication, DULERA, was recently approved by the U.S. FDA, and we've begun its launch. 
As we shared with many of you during our R&D Day in May, we also have several falling under late-stage review in the EU. From our robust pipeline, we anticipate making about 20 filings for new compounds and new combinations between now and 2012, including boceprevir, vorapaxar, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE in the U.S. 
We also remain well positioned in Animal Health, a business that is driven by growing demand for animal proteins, as well as a strong demand for companion animal healthcare. We are on track to bring together sanofi-aventis and our Animal Health businesses into a new joint venture that will create a new global leader in Animal Health. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be excited about the many opportunities before us to serve the rapidly expanding emerging markets. Throughout these markets, I believe we continue to position Merck well by launching new products and making targeted business development investments. 
Examples of our commitment and execution can be found in high-growth markets like China and South Africa. In South Africa, we have a newly formed strategic collaboration with a local partner, Adcock Ingram. Together, we will co-promote and distribute branded products as well as over-the-counter medications. This collaboration will extend our reach into the market. 
Earlier this month, Merck's executive committee members and I spent a busy week in China. It has become one of our most important markets. Providing needed medicine and vaccines to meet the expanding needs of Chinese patients is an exciting growth opportunity for us. So we are focused on building our capabilities in China including our local production capabilities, our product portfolio and R&D. 
As part of our expansion efforts, we recently unveiled joint venture plan with Sinopharm to manufacture and commercialize adult and pediatric vaccines in China, and announced plans for a manufacturing site in Hangzhou, where we'll invest to build local capacity. I've seen firsthand the excitement and hard work underway in our emerging markets around the world, with China being the most recent example. That's why I am confident that we will reach our goal of deriving 25% of our global pharmaceutical and vaccine revenue from emerging markets in 2013. 
Merck's commitment to improving health around the world is not new to us. This commitment dates back decades and most recently, was recognized by the Access to Medicine Index. Merck was ranked second in the global analysis of companies that are making their medicines and vaccines readily available to markets across all income levels. All of these actions support Merck's mission to help patients around the world and to maximize shareholder return by providing innovative medicines, vaccines and consumer and Animal Health products, globally. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken

288502,108814676,70876,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our secon",1726,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our second quarter performance, please note that I will refer to supplemental combined non-GAAP results, which include the impact of foreign exchange. 
The Global Human Health business delivered a solid quarter with sales of $9.8 billion. This represents a 2% decline on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis from the previous year, largely due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR especially in the U.S. If you've been following the weekly prescription trends, then you have seen that there has been rapid erosion of approximately 90% of branded COZAAR and HYZAAR prescription volume in the U.S. Other markets such as the U.K. and Italy have also experienced rapid erosion. 
Excluding the impact of COZAAR and HYZAAR, Global Human Health sales grew 3% year-over-year. Sales were driven by the robust operational growth of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, TEMODAR and ISENTRESS. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for these brands. The speed with which we integrated our commercial operations, the diversity of our portfolio and the underlying strength of our global business have been key factors in our successful start to the first half of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to drive growth in many of our markets. International Human Health sales grew by 5% excluding COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our Emerging Markets business grew 12% in the second quarter. We spent a fair amount of time during the business briefing in May discussing our strategy and goals in the emerging markets. As we said then, we believe these markets will grow to represent more than a quarter of our pharmaceutical and vaccine sales by 2013. 
In the second quarter, the emerging markets accounted for 19% of our human health sales. Two of the emerging markets, China and Brazil, are quickly working their way up our list of top 10 markets. Sales in China and Brazil both grew by more than 15% in the quarter. We continue to expect to have significant future growth opportunities across the emerging markets. 
We are well-positioned to drive significant growth with our current portfolio of products, including JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, as well as branded generics like COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as ZOCOR. We are also exploring multiple strategies to increase our share in the branded generic and patent-protected segments through value-creating partnerships and acquisitions. 
Dick mentioned some of the recent developments in China, including the recent letter of mutual agreement with Sinopharm to develop a joint venture to commercialize pediatric and adult vaccines in China, a very large potential market. 
Now turning to the performance of some of our key brands this quarter. As I drop the individual product performance, you can follow along in Table 3 from our supplemental financial package, as Alex said earlier. Starting with our respiratory franchise, SINGULAIR sales in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, comparable to the second quarter 2009. This year, the spring allergy season peaked early in the U.S. and was overall comparable to the 2009 season. Sales in the U.S. this quarter were also affected by unfavorable fluctuations in trade inventory. Double-digit growth of SINGULAIR in the emerging markets was offset by declines in Japan due to the timing of shipments to our partner. 
For NASONEX, global sales increased 5% driven by the strong growth in the U.S. and Japan. Despite the flat year-over-year comparisons for the allergy season in the U.S., sales of NASONEX grew in the U.S. by 7%. NASONEX continues to be the leading branded nasal-inhaled steroid, and now includes additional congestion labeling in the U.S.  In Japan, we've had robust growth since the launch, and NASONEX is now the market leader. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 33% to a combined $818 million. The JANUVIA franchise continues to perform strongly in terms of share and overall growth. Sales in the quarter were driven by double-digit growth across all markets. In Japan, where we recently launched JANUVIA, sales were $69 million, which included supply sales to our partner of about $40 million. We've seen strong initial response to the value proposition JANUVIA represents to Japanese physicians and patients. 
Our Immunology franchise also achieved strong growth during the quarter. REMICADE continues to be a leading immunological therapy with sales of $669 million, an increase of 18% from the previous year. REMICADE continues to deliver growth across all indications, rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. We anticipate REMICADE's double-digit operational growth will continue throughout 2010. 
In addition, sales of SIMPONI were $18 million in the quarter. SIMPONI sales continue to grow as we launch the brand in more countries and take share from other subcutaneous anti-TNF. We've now launched and 10 countries, most recently in Spain. We will launch SIMPONI in other EU markets in the second half of 2010 and launches in the U.K. and France are planned for 2011. 
Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, which in the aggregate represents a 3% decline compared to the previous year primarily due to declines in the U.S. Sequentially, ZETIA and VYTORIN grew 4%, globally. ZETIA and VYTORIN remain a primary focus of our promotional efforts, and we continue to see solid growth in many markets around the world, including 28% year-over-year growth in Japan. We continue to make progress on the IMPROVE-IT study, which is now fully enrolled with over 18,000 patients. 
Moving on to vaccines. For the total Vaccine business, I will focus my comments on sequential comparisons. Total sales for the Vaccine business were $832 million in the second quarter compared to $846 million in the first quarter of 2010. As a reminder, vaccine sales in the first quarter benefited from a $75 million to $100 million inventory build. With that in mind, we had some bright spots in the second quarter specifically with respect to RotaTeq, which benefited from a temporary competitor supply issue and PNEUMOVAX. This, unfortunately, was offset by weaker ZOSTAVAX sales due to supply constraints and the ongoing backorders for the brand. This is a frustrating situation for our teams, our customers and patients. And we have dedicated several hundred engineers and researchers to getting it fixed. We continue to work to resolve our current supply issues and to create redundant capacity in our facilities in North Carolina and Ireland. However, we do expect sales to be negatively affected by the supply issue again in the third quarter this year. 
Moving to GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the second quarter were $219 million, an 18% decline from the previous year. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales grew sequentially by 5%. We've made good progress with the coverage prevails [ph] and funding is now secured for all states. GARDASIL continues to maintain market share leadership in the U.S., and it also remains the global market leader. 
In Infectious Diseases, ISENTRESS continues its outstanding performance as sales increased 55% to $267 million in the second quarter. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and tolerability profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations around the world. 
While many of our brands reported positive growth trends in the EU during the second quarter, the environment in the EU and across Europe is now more challenging. Many countries have announced austerity measures aimed at reducing costs in areas such as healthcare. While the implementation of pricing actions varies by country, many have announced measures to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs. 
In the short term, we've worked with many of the industry groups and governments to help develop solutions for our customers to improve their budget positions and address the short-term economic issues. While we are taking steps to mitigate the immediate impact in the EU, we anticipate that the austerity measures will affect our revenue performance going forward.  Peter Kellogg will focus on the financial impact of the EU austerity measures in his remarks shortly. 
Moving from the economic environment, I'd like to highlight briefly some recent developments from three of our key R&D programs: DULERA, vorapaxar and boceprevir. As you know, we're in the process of launching many new products this year and we have robust late-stage pipeline with programs that represent significant scientific achievements and first-in-class opportunities. 
In June, as Dick mentioned, we received U.S. FDA approval of DULERA, our combination steroid and long-acting beta agonist for the treatment of asthma. Despite the availability of other combination treatments, there remains some large unmet need in asthma, and we believe DULERA represents a great alternative due to its differentiated profile, which includes the addition of clinically-judged deteriorations in asthma within its label. We are beginning the launch of DULERA now with plans for a full commercial launch late in the third quarter. 
Our Phase III program for vorapaxar, our PAR-1 inhibitor for the prevention of major cardiovascular events is also progressing well. Both Phase III studies are now fully enrolled. The TRA 2P study in secondary prevention is fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. The TRA-CER study in patients with acute coronary syndrome is also fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. 
Based on current event rates, we anticipate that both studies will be completed in mid-2011. We are pleased with the progress in the Phase III program. Most importantly, we continue to target a 2011 filings for vorapaxar.
Turning to boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor, I'm pleased to share with you that both Phase III studies are now completed, and we're in the process of analyzing the results. We plan to submit the Phase III data for presentation at the AASLD meeting in November.  Finally, we remain on track to file boceprevir in 2010. 
In closing, Global Human Health, along with Animal Health and Consumer Health Care, have delivered another solid quarter for Merck. We continue to be excited by our portfolio of products and our robust late-stage pipeline. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we continue to execute on our long-term strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company.

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway.

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway. Our performance this quarter is characterized by solid operational performance, which was tampered by the impact of generic entries for COZAAR and HYZAAR and the cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and geographies performed. And now I'd like to cover three areas with you: First, our operating results; second, our restructuring activities; and third, I want to discuss our targets for full year 2010 and beyond. 
So let's begin with our results. As Alex mentioned, we have once again provided data in our earnings release and supplemental charts to help navigate through our non-GAAP adjustments to the P&L. To simplify my remarks today, I will speak the non-GAAP results, which exclude purchase price accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges and the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise. 
On this basis, we reported second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion. On a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, sales were down 2% versus prior year due primarily to the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and lower Astra supply sale due to the generic erosion and return of rights to the non-PPI products. These offset solid operational growth in the rest of the business. Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. 
Our Animal Health business grew 9% to $731 million, reflecting growth among cattle, poultry and swine products. We remain on track to complete our Animal Health joint venture with sanofi-aventis in the first quarter of 2011. Consumer Care sales increased 11% to $422 million due to the strong seasonal performance of Claritin and Coppertone. 
Now moving on to the expense items in the P&L. You can see that we did a very good job managing our expenses this quarter in anticipation of additional commercial launches and spending on our late-stage pipeline expected during third and fourth quarter. As you know, the cost of our combined company are represented in our current cost base, whereas only the Merck costs were included in the second quarter of 2009. So it's a little hard to see the underlying trends on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to sequential trends on the cost lines since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
Let's begin with the materials in production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was approximately 76.5%, which is an improvement compared to the first quarter of 2010 where the gross margin was 75.4%. Most of the improvement in the gross margin was driven by product mix, with higher sequential sales of JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and increased sales of seasonal allergy products. 
Moving onto marketing and admin expenses, on an on-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $3.1 billion, which is about the same level as in the first quarter of 2010. Research and development expenses for the second quarter was approximately $2 billion, which is also in line with the first quarter. As the year progresses, we see continued investment in late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the second quarter, Merck reported $43 million of equity income, which was a decrease from the first quarter primarily due to inherent variability and the timing of payments for the AstraZeneca joint venture. 
Moving on to other income and expense. The GAAP results include $443 million from AstraZeneca's exercise of the asset option. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $153 million was comparable to the first quarter of 2010. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the second quarter, better than the rate that we saw in the first quarter. As noted in the earnings release, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $1.3 billion to repurchase about 38 million shares of our common stock.  So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since merger. 
Now let's talk about the integration activities. This quarter, we made continued progress on our cost synergy capture by reducing our headcount in global infrastructure and generating savings from procurement actions. On July 8, we announced our plans to phase out operations at eight manufacturing facilities and eight research facilities over the next two years. The merger restructuring program also includes consolidating our sites in local markets by closing 58 commercial offices. The actions we have announced so far will bring our number of R&D sites down to 16 and our number of our manufacturing sites down to 48, excluding Animal Health sites. 
We will continue to pursue productivity efficiencies and evaluate our manufacturing supply-chain capabilities on an ongoing basis. Remember, we are planning to create a new Animal Health joint venture, so our Animal Health business is not involved in the Merck merger researching activities. As a result of these and other actions such as procurement savings, we are well on track to realize a $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. 
Now let's spend the remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond that. Let's start with 2010. With the first six months complete, it's appropriate to provide an update on our earnings targets. We have maintained $3.34 as the midpoint of our range while tightening the EPS range for the full year. Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 non-GAAP EPS range of $3.29 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Factored into this target EPS range is our strong first quarter results, continued benefits from synergies in the second half, the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous comments, and the assumption that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. 
In addition, we have assumed top line pressures due to pricing actions in some European countries and foreign exchange, both of which we believe will be a headwind in the second half. In addition, we anticipate increased second half spending for new product launches like DULERA in the U.S., new targeted commercial and R&D investments in the emerging markets and spending to support the late-stage pipeline. 
Let me go into a bit more detail to help you understand what is already factored in to the 2010 targets. As you know, and as Ken mentioned, Greece, Spain, Germany and some other markets have already announced price reductions, which will have an unfavorable impact on our results in the third and fourth quarter of 2010. The impact on European revenues in the first half was about 2% unfavorable. In the second half, we anticipate a mid single-digit unfavorable impact on European sales. 
These updates are included in our 2010 targets and will impact our second half performance relative to what we were modeling at the beginning of the year. As a result, we now expect that EPS in the second half will be similar to the level in the first half. So you should adjust your models accordingly. Logically, these actions in 2010 will also have an impact in 2011 as they annualize. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about the future of the new Merck, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities that are already well underway. We continue to target a high single-digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013. 
In closing, we are pleased with the solid second quarter results we reported today. We clearly had a strong first half. Our expense management contributed to that performance and will help us manage a tighter environment in Europe. The merger is working, and our results and our short-term and long-term earnings targets demonstrate that we are right on track. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex.

I think from our perspective, I think it's important to recognize that we always study TRA and always anticipated that it would be added to the standard of care whether it was aspirin, PLAVIX or another medicine in PLAVIX class. So it was always our intent to have it added on top of the standard of care. And so we would think that it would be added on to Belinta [ph] as that became approved at some point and became a competitor of PLAVIX. I also think it's important to recognize that even with the, for example, 16% increase, a great deal of residual risk still remains, cardiovascular risk still remains. And therefore, there's still an important role for medicine like TRA. I also think it's important to remember the product profile, which includes the fact that we have not seen any increase in bleeding unlike some of the other medicines that are being used. So for all of these reasons, I continue to think that there are really robust prospects for our medicine like TRA.

This is Dick. I think the issue, as Ken mentioned, is that we've put significant amount of technical and engineering resources on this both from a manufacturing and a research standpoint, and certainly, right now we are cautiously optimistic. We have begun production again of varicella. We believe that by starting production, we have a path forward. So that's good news. It's not going to have an impact on 2010 forecast because the product process cycle is significant, so there's many more production steps to go through yet. There's more quality testing to go through. There's more discussions with the agencies to go through. But I am cautiously optimistic due to the fact that, obviously, we've started production that is important. Now the second important aspect is, as Ken mentioned, is that we've started our focus on Durham, and we hope to have that, from a production standpoint, up and running in the second half of this year. And from a pediatric standpoint, with the relaunch of COMVAX, our HIB and Hepatitis B combination vaccines, all of Merck pediatric vaccines will be available in U.S. for the first time since mid-2007. So we are making that type of progress, but we'll keep our fingers crossed on ZOSTAVAX because we did start production again.

Let me just start by saying that I think we continue to be very excited about the future in China. To look at China in a monolithic way as it relates to pricing or any other aspect of our commercial strategy, I think is not how we are going to approach it. So let's start with the robust growth that we anticipate in the middle class in the urban areas of China. For those people, healthcare is still likely to be a self-pay exercise, and so we will continue to look at those market segments in a way that we can price competitively with alternative therapies. But I will say that the pricing in China has allowed both a broad access, while at the same time, also allowing strong profit margins in that country. I think the other aspect is through the government. And so there's an essential drug list, which is part of Chinese healthcare reform, and Merck participated in the Essential Drug List placing ZOCOR among other magazines on that drug list. And our experience there has been that while we had to provide substantial discounts to get entree to the Essential Drug List, the volumes have more than compensated for the pricing reductions that we have. So I think what we've seen with ZOCOR right now is an example of how in that market, we have the price in a way that creates value for that market and there's still an opportunity to be profitable in that context.

Obviously, we have, as I commented and as you pointed out, we've taken into account some of the top line pressures we see in the balance of the year. Obviously, we do expect to see the pricing impact in the second half of the year. The way we look at it, it's about mid single-digit range impact on the European revenues. Translating that to the top line, it's probably in the neighborhood of, I'm guessing, it's about $300 million or so. And obviously, we have to fully annualize that next year. The other thing is, obviously, Forex. Now the impact of Forex for us is a little complex because obviously, you have the Forex impact around the world, not just euro but yen and other currencies. And you have to net that against our hedge program. We anticipate in the second half of the year currency being a slight negative on our top line, probably something in the 1%, 2% range kind of as you go through the second half of the year. Obviously, those rates still move around. So those are the primary factors in addition to the healthcare reform. So that said, going the other way, we have a lot of activity on the expense line in the second half that will actually be driving our business going forward. And as we go into 2011, we'll be launching DULERA, we have a lot of activity going on in Japan, launching products, having a lot of success. We will be, obviously, investing in the emerging markets as you've seen announcements, and we'll continue to grow there. And obviously, our pipeline, which is a big driver for us in the future, continues to move forward with very nice progress. So you can expect to see some spending in that in the second half, a little more in the first half. So all those points combine to lead us to our guidance. But the most important thing is we didn't change the midpoint of our guidance range. We just narrowed the range as we've gone through the first half of the year.

I would say a couple of things. We continue to focus on building the brand awareness, and we're also getting reasonably good unrestricted Managed Care access about 65%. But the product right now, I would say frankly, is not where we want it to be. On TREDAPTIVE, I would say that obviously for us, the sales have not yet become material in Europe. But the real thing that we're doing on TREDAPTIVE is HPS2-THRIVE and creating a market in the U.S. I think there's still a need -- a growing awareness of HDL as its impact on cardiovascular health going forward. I would say the other issues around launches are, we are very pleased with the way SIMPONI is going, JANUVIA's continuing the launch well around the world including Japan. BRIDION is having a spectacular launch in Japan, and we look forward to DULERA. So I would just say that SAPHRIS and TREDAPTIVE has not yet become material. We continue to think TREDAPTIVE has a great future in the U.S., and we continue to work with SAPHRIS. And then I also -- it was pointed out to me that I forgot to answer quickly the Chinese IP question and I would say that on that one, we continue to proceed carefully with respect to our assets in China to make sure that we get the benefit of that market while also protecting our IP.

But if you go back to why this is such an important merger to the company, it's far beyond the cost synergies. Cost synergies, in many cases, is an afterthought to why we did this merger and why we're still excited about it. First of all, the most important aspect of this merger that we continue to be excited upon is that it's a late-stage pipeline, and the research synergies from the standpoint that you're -- you have complementary franchises, and there's not much overlap and mechanism of actions, and there's great scientific and technological sharing out that is just so important for the future of the company. So the first and foremost reason why this makes sense moving forward is the scientific and research pipeline and the scientific and research technology that we're sharing across mutual franchises as we move forward. The second part to that is the product portfolio. The excitement that we see from our professional reps country-by-country when we visit there about having now a combined portfolio that can really come up with the right resolution for patients and physicians is just incredible. We're no longer a one trick pony when it comes to some franchises or to these states. We have a portfolio that can meet their needs, and I think that capability is extremely important. And then third, I think is the geographical footprint we have. The geographical footprint that we combined with the two companies, as you know, is critical to the future since we're not and will not be a U.S.-centric company. So when you look at all of those evaluations, to us, those are the most important. And obviously, REMICADE and SIMPONI are important as well, but even without those two, this makes a lot of sense to us.

We excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation table, so you can get a better sense of the underlying performance for the quarter. We've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, you can see the company's SEC filings as well as today's earnings release in the tables at merck.com.

Our strong bottom line performance in the second quarter demonstrates Merck's continued success in executing our post-merger strategy. We're now halfway through our first full year as a combined company. Already, we're seeing positive signs of what can be achieved. Despite patent expiries and a challenging economy, I'm very pleased with what our team has accomplished. 
We remain focused on driving revenue growth, maintaining the momentum of our business, reducing our cost structure and making the right strategic investments globally. All of which are allowing us to make good progress toward Merck's overall goal of becoming the best healthcare company in the world. Strong underlying product performance helped us to realize topline worldwide sales of $11.3 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter. 
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, ISENTRESS and TEMODAR were again standouts this quarter. In addition, Animal Health and Merck Consumer Care produced strong global sales. With our strong performance for the first half of the year, we continued to have confidence in delivering on our long-term financial targets. We also remain committed to achieving our previously-announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in ongoing annual savings in 2012. 
We have already announced initial phases of the merger restructuring program that will contribute approximately $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion toward the overall target, with procurement savings in subsequent stages to account for the rest. 
In a few moments, Ken will discuss in more detail our global product performance, and then Peter will discuss our full year earnings outlook. But first, let me highlight a few areas. 
Merck's integration remains very much on course. But it will involve more hard work and difficult decisions as we proceed forward with our efforts to capture the full value of the new Merck for patients, customers and shareholders. The announcements we made recently did tell them the plans to integrate Merck's global research and manufacturing operations is another key step, but not the final one, in successfully executing our overall plan to create an industry-leading operating model. 
On the R&D side, our goal is to create a more flexible organization that fuels innovation in our pipeline and excels at external collaboration. On the manufacturing side, we aim to have a more reliable cost-efficient worldwide supply chain to support Merck's broader product portfolio, and meet the demand of a diverse and ever-revolving global health care environment. And while there are still lots of moving parts, we are building our strong track record of quickly executing our integration plans, while launching new products and delivering strong performance from current months. That has what allowed us to drive revenue growth in key brands despite patent expiries and difficult economic conditions. 
In markets around the world, we simultaneously have launches underway for a range of products including SIMPONI in 10 markets, and JANUVIA in Japan and in India. Additionally, our latest asthma dedication, DULERA, was recently approved by the U.S. FDA, and we've begun its launch. 
As we shared with many of you during our R&D Day in May, we also have several falling under late-stage review in the EU. From our robust pipeline, we anticipate making about 20 filings for new compounds and new combinations between now and 2012, including boceprevir, vorapaxar, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE in the U.S. 
We also remain well positioned in Animal Health, a business that is driven by growing demand for animal proteins, as well as a strong demand for companion animal healthcare. We are on track to bring together sanofi-aventis and our Animal Health businesses into a new joint venture that will create a new global leader in Animal Health. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be excited about the many opportunities before us to serve the rapidly expanding emerging markets. Throughout these markets, I believe we continue to position Merck well by launching new products and making targeted business development investments. 
Examples of our commitment and execution can be found in high-growth markets like China and South Africa. In South Africa, we have a newly formed strategic collaboration with a local partner, Adcock Ingram. Together, we will co-promote and distribute branded products as well as over-the-counter medications. This collaboration will extend our reach into the market. 
Earlier this month, Merck's executive committee members and I spent a busy week in China. It has become one of our most important markets. Providing needed medicine and vaccines to meet the expanding needs of Chinese patients is an exciting growth opportunity for us. So we are focused on building our capabilities in China including our local production capabilities, our product portfolio and R&D. 
As part of our expansion efforts, we recently unveiled joint venture plans with Sinopharm to manufacture and commercialize adult and pediatric vaccines in China, and announced plans for a manufacturing site in Hangzhou, where we'll invest to build local capacity. I've seen firsthand the excitement and hard work underway in our emerging markets around the world, with China being the most recent example. That's why I am confident that we will reach our goal of deriving 25% of our global pharmaceutical and vaccine revenue from emerging markets in 2013. 
Merck's commitment to improving health around the world is not new to us. This commitment dates back decades and most recently was recognized by the Access to Medicine Index. Merck was ranked second in the global analysis of companies that are making their medicines and vaccines readily available to markets across all income levels. All of these actions support Merck's mission to help patients around the world and to maximize shareholder return by providing innovative medicines, vaccines and consumer and Animal Health products, globally. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken."

As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our secon",1727,"Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter despite losing the exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR and the economic challenges facing our businesses and customers around the world. In describing our second quarter performance, please note that I will refer to supplemental combined non-GAAP results, which include the impact of foreign exchange. 
The Global Human Health business delivered a solid quarter with sales of $9.8 billion. This represents a 2% decline on a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis from the previous year, largely due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR especially in the U.S. If you've been following the weekly prescription trends, then you have seen that there has been rapid erosion of approximately 90% of branded COZAAR and HYZAAR prescription volume in the U.S. Other markets such as the U.K. and Italy have also experienced rapid erosion. 
Excluding the impact of COZAAR and HYZAAR, Global Human Health sales grew 3% year-over-year. Sales were driven by the robust operational growth of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, TEMODAR and ISENTRESS. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for these brands. The speed with which we've integrated our commercial operations, the diversity of our portfolio and the underlying strength of our global business have been key factors in our successful start to the first half of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to drive growth in many of our markets. International Human Health sales grew by 5% excluding COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our Emerging Markets business grew 12% in the second quarter. We spent a fair amount of time during the business briefing in May discussing our strategy and goals in the emerging markets. As we said then, we believe these markets will grow to represent more than a quarter of our pharmaceutical and vaccine sales by 2013. 
In the second quarter, the emerging markets accounted for 19% of our human health sales. Two of the emerging markets, China and Brazil, are quickly working their way up our list of top 10 markets. Sales in China and Brazil both grew by more than 15% in the quarter. We continue to expect to have significant future growth opportunities across the emerging markets. 
We are well-positioned to drive significant growth with our current portfolio of products, including JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, as well as branded generics like COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as ZOCOR. We are also exploring multiple strategies to increase our share in the branded generic and patent-protected segments through value-creating partnerships and acquisitions. 
Dick mentioned some of the recent developments in China, including the recent letter of mutual agreement with Sinopharm to develop a joint venture to commercialize pediatric and adult vaccines in China, a very large potential market. 
Now turning to the performance of some of our key brands this quarter. As I drop the individual product performance, you can follow along in Table 3 from our supplemental financial package, as Alex said earlier. Starting with our respiratory franchise, SINGULAIR sales in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, comparable to the second quarter 2009. This year, the spring allergy season peaked early in the U.S. and was overall comparable to the 2009 season. Sales in the U.S. this quarter were also affected by unfavorable fluctuations in trade inventory. Double-digit growth of SINGULAIR in the emerging markets was offset by declines in Japan due to the timing of shipments to our partner. 
For NASONEX, global sales increased 5% driven by the strong growth in the U.S. and Japan. Despite the flat year-over-year comparisons for the allergy season in the U.S., sales of NASONEX grew in the U.S. by 7%. NASONEX continues to be the leading branded nasal-inhaled steroid, and now includes additional congestion labeling in the U.S.  In Japan, we've had robust growth since the launch, and NASONEX is now the market leader. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 33% to a combined $818 million. The JANUVIA franchise continues to perform strongly in terms of share and overall growth. Sales in the quarter were driven by double-digit growth across all markets. In Japan, where we recently launched JANUVIA, sales were $69 million, which included supply sales to our partner of about $40 million. We've seen strong initial response to the value proposition JANUVIA represents to Japanese physicians and patients. 
Our Immunology franchise also achieved strong growth during the quarter. REMICADE continues to be a leading immunological therapy with sales of $669 million, an increase of 18% from the previous year. REMICADE continues to deliver growth across all indications, rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. We anticipate REMICADE's double-digit operational growth will continue throughout 2010. 
In addition, sales of SIMPONI were $18 million in the quarter. SIMPONI sales continue to grow as we launch the brand in more countries and take share from other subcutaneous anti-TNF. We've now launched and 10 countries, most recently in Spain. We will launch SIMPONI in other EU markets in the second half of 2010 and launches in the U.K. and France are planned for 2011. 
Turning to ZETIA and VYTORIN. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, which in the aggregate represents a 3% decline compared to the previous year primarily due to declines in the U.S. Sequentially, ZETIA and VYTORIN grew 4%, globally. ZETIA and VYTORIN remain a primary focus of our promotional efforts, and we continue to see solid growth in many markets around the world, including 28% year-over-year growth in Japan. We continue to make progress on the IMPROVE-IT study, which is now fully enrolled with over 18,000 patients. 
Moving on to vaccines. For the total Vaccine business, I will focus my comments on sequential comparisons. Total sales for the Vaccine business were $832 million in the second quarter compared to $846 million in the first quarter of 2010. As a reminder, vaccine sales in the first quarter benefited from a $75 million to $100 million inventory build. With that in mind, we had some bright spots in the second quarter specifically with respect to RotaTeq, which benefited from a temporary competitor supply issue and PNEUMOVAX. This, unfortunately, was offset by weaker ZOSTAVAX sales due to supply constraints and the ongoing backorders for the brand. This is a frustrating situation for our teams, our customers and patients. And we have dedicated several hundred engineers and researchers to getting it fixed. We continue to work to resolve our current supply issues and to create redundant capacity in our facilities in North Carolina and Ireland. However, we do expect sales to be negatively affected by the supply issue again in the third quarter this year. 
Moving to GARDASIL. Sales as reported by Merck in the second quarter were $219 million, an 18% decline from the previous year. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales grew sequentially by 5%. We've made good progress with the coverage prevails [ph] and funding is now secured for all states. GARDASIL continues to maintain market share leadership in the U.S., and it also remains the global market leader. 
In Infectious Diseases, ISENTRESS continues its outstanding performance as sales increased 55% to $267 million in the second quarter. The continued growth of ISENTRESS reflects the unique efficacy and tolerability profile of this product, which has been widely embraced by physicians, patients and health organizations around the world. 
While many of our brands reported positive growth trends in the EU during the second quarter, the environment in the EU and across Europe is now more challenging. Many countries have announced austerity measures aimed at reducing costs in areas such as healthcare. While the implementation of pricing actions varies by country, many have announced measures to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs. 
In the short term, we've worked with many of the industry groups and governments to help develop solutions for our customers to improve their budget positions and address the short-term economic issues. While we are taking steps to mitigate the immediate impact in the EU, we anticipate that the austerity measures will affect our revenue performance going forward.  Peter Kellogg will focus on the financial impact of the EU austerity measures in his remarks shortly. 
Moving from the economic environment, I'd like to highlight briefly some recent developments from three of our key R&D programs: DULERA, vorapaxar and boceprevir. As you know, we're in the process of launching many new products this year and we have robust late-stage pipeline with programs that represent significant scientific achievements and first-in-class opportunities. 
In June, as Dick mentioned, we received U.S. FDA approval of DULERA, our combination steroid and long-acting beta agonist for the treatment of asthma. Despite the availability of other combination treatments, there remains some large unmet need in asthma, and we believe DULERA represents a great alternative due to its differentiated profile, which includes the addition of clinically-judged deteriorations in asthma within its label. We are beginning the launch of DULERA now with plans for a full commercial launch late in the third quarter. 
Our Phase III program for vorapaxar, our PAR-1 inhibitor for the prevention of major cardiovascular events is also progressing well. Both Phase III studies are now fully enrolled. The TRA 2P study in secondary prevention is fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. The TRA-CER study in patients with acute coronary syndrome is also fully enrolled, and patients are being monitored for the accrual of events. 
Based on current event rates, we anticipate that both studies will be completed in mid 2011. We are pleased with the progress in the Phase III program. Most importantly, we continue to target a 2011 filing for vorapaxar.
Turning to boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor, I'm pleased to share with you that both Phase III studies are now completed, and we're in the process of analyzing the results. We plan to submit the Phase III data for presentation at the AASLD meeting in November.  Finally, we remain on track to file boceprevir in 2010. 
In closing, Global Human Health, along with Animal Health and Consumer Health Care, have delivered another solid quarter for Merck. We continue to be excited by our portfolio of products and our robust late-stage pipeline. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we continue to execute on our long-term strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company. 
Now I will pass the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway.

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, we continued our performance in the second quarter and our integration efforts are well underway. Our performance this quarter is characterized by solid operational performance, which was tempered by the impact of generic entries for COZAAR and HYZAAR and the cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and geographies performed. And now I'd like to cover three areas with you: First, our operating results; second, our restructuring activities; and third, I want to discuss our targets for full year 2010 and beyond. 
So let's begin with our results. As Alex mentioned, we have once again provided data in our earnings release and supplemental charts to help navigate through our non-GAAP adjustments to the P&L. To simplify my remarks today, I will speak the non-GAAP results, which exclude purchase price accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges and the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise. 
On this basis, we reported second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion. On a supplemental combined non-GAAP basis, sales were down 2% versus prior year due primarily to the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and lower Astra supply sale due to the generic erosion and return of rights to the non-PPI products. These offset solid operational growth in the rest of the business. Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. 
Our Animal Health business grew 9% to $731 million, reflecting growth among cattle, poultry and swine products. We remain on track to complete our Animal Health joint venture with sanofi-aventis in the first quarter of 2011. Consumer Care sales increased 11% to $422 million due to the strong seasonal performance of Claritin and Coppertone. 
Now moving on to the expense items in the P&L. You can see that we did a very good job managing our expenses this quarter in anticipation of additional commercial launches and spending on our late-stage pipeline expected during third and fourth quarter. As you know, the cost of our combined company are represented in our current cost base, whereas only the Merck costs were included in the second quarter of 2009. So it's a little hard to see the underlying trends on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to sequential trends on the cost lines since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
Let's begin with the materials in production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was approximately 76.5%, which is an improvement compared to the first quarter of 2010 where the gross margin was 75.4%. Most of the improvement in the gross margin was driven by product mix, with higher sequential sales of JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and increased sales of seasonal allergy products. 
Moving onto marketing and admin expenses, on a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $3.1 billion, which is about the same level as in the first quarter of 2010. Research and development expenses for the second quarter was approximately $2 billion, which is also in line with the first quarter. As the year progresses, we see continued investment in late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the second quarter, Merck reported $43 million of equity income, which was a decrease from the first quarter primarily due to the inherent variability and the timing of payments for the AstraZeneca joint venture. 
Moving on to other income and expense. The GAAP results include $443 million from AstraZeneca's exercise of the asset option. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $153 million was comparable to the first quarter of 2010. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the second quarter, better than the rate that we saw in the first quarter. As noted in the earnings release, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $1.3 billion to repurchase about 38 million shares of our common stock.  So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since merger. 
Now let's talk about the integration activities. This quarter, we made continued progress on our cost synergy capture by reducing our headcount in global infrastructure and generating savings from procurement actions. On July 8, we announced our plans to phase out operations at eight manufacturing facilities and eight research facilities over the next two years. The merger restructuring program also includes consolidating our sites in local markets by closing 58 commercial offices. The actions we have announced so far will bring our number of R&D sites down to 16 and our number of our manufacturing sites down to 48, excluding Animal Health sites. 
We will continue to pursue productivity efficiencies and evaluate our manufacturing supply-chain capabilities on an ongoing basis. Remember, we are planning to create a new Animal Health joint venture, so our Animal Health business is not involved in the Merck merger researching activities. As a result of these and other actions such as procurement savings, we are well on track to realize a $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. 
Now let's spend the remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond that. Let's start with 2010. With the first six months complete, it's appropriate to provide an update on our earnings targets. We have maintained $3.34 as the midpoint of our range while tightening the EPS range for the full year. Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 non-GAAP EPS range of $3.29 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Factored into this target EPS range is our strong first quarter results, continued benefits from synergies in the second half, the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous comments, and the assumption that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. 
In addition, we have assumed top line pressures due to pricing actions in some European countries and foreign exchange, both of which we believe will be a headwind in the second half. In addition, we anticipate increased second half spending for new product launches like DULERA in the U.S., new targeted commercial and R&D investments in the emerging markets and spending to support the late-stage pipeline. 
Let me go into a bit more detail to help you understand what is already factored in to the 2010 targets. As you know, and as Ken mentioned, Greece, Spain, Germany and some other markets have already announced price reductions, which will have an unfavorable impact on our results in the third and fourth quarter of 2010. The impact on European revenues in the first half was about 2% unfavorable. In the second half, we anticipate a mid single-digit unfavorable impact on European sales. 
These updates are included in our 2010 targets and will impact our second half performance relative to what we were modeling at the beginning of the year. As a result, we now expect that EPS in the second half will be similar to the level in the first half. So you should adjust your models accordingly. Logically, these actions in 2010 will also have an impact in 2011 as they annualize. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about the future of the new Merck, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities that are already well underway. We continue to target a high single-digit, non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013. 
In closing, we are pleased with the solid second quarter results we reported today. We clearly had a strong first half. Our expense management contributed to that performance and will help us manage a tighter environment in Europe. The merger is working, and our results and our short-term and long-term earnings targets demonstrate that we are right on track. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex."

And so we would think that it would be added on to Belinta [ph] as that became approved at some point and became a competitor of PLAVIX. I also think it's important to recognize that even with the, for example, 16% increase, a great deal of residual risk still remains, cardiovascular risk still remains.

We have begun production again of varicella. We believe that by starting production, we have a path forward. So that's good news. It's not going to have an impact on 2010 forecast because the product process cycle is significant, so there's many more production steps to go through yet. There's more quality testing to go through. There's more discussions with the agencies to go through. But I am cautiously optimistic due to the fact that, obviously, we've started production that is important. Now the second important aspect is, as Ken mentioned, is that we've started our focus on Durham, and we hope to have that, from a production standpoint, up and running in the second half of this year. And from a pediatric standpoint, with the relaunch of COMVAX, our HIB and Hepatitis B combination vaccines, all of Merck pediatric vaccines will be available in U.S. for the first time since mid-2007. So we are making that type of progress, but we'll keep our fingers crossed on ZOSTAVAX because we did start production again."

To look at China in a monolithic way as it relates to pricing or any other aspect of our commercial strategy, I think is not how we are going to approach it. So let's start with the robust growth that we anticipate in the middle class in the urban areas of China. For those people, healthcare is still likely to be a self-pay exercise, and so we will continue to look at those market segments in a way that we can price competitively with alternative therapies. But I will say that the pricing in China has allowed both broad access, while at the same time, also allowing strong profit margins in that country. I think the other aspect is through the government. And so there's an essential drug list, which is part of Chinese healthcare reform, and Merck participated in the Essential Drug List placing ZOCOR among other magazines on that drug list. And our experience there has been that while we had to provide substantial discounts to get entree to the Essential Drug List, the volumes have more than compensated for the pricing reductions that we have. So I think what we've seen with ZOCOR right now is an example of how, in that market, we have to price in a way that creates value for that market and there's still an opportunity to be profitable in that context."

So we really maintain the midpoint of our guidance range and EPS. Obviously, we have, as I commented and as you pointed out, we've taken into account some of the top line pressures we see in the balance of the year. Obviously, we do expect to see the pricing impact in the second half of the year. The way we look at it, it's about mid single-digit range impact on the European revenues. Translating that to the top line, it's probably in the neighborhood of, I'm guessing, it's about $300 million or so. And obviously, we have to fully annualize that next year. The other thing is, obviously, Forex. Now the impact of Forex for us is a little complex because obviously, you have the Forex impact around the world, not just euro but yen and other currencies. And you have to net that against our hedge program. We anticipate in the second half of the year currency being a slight negative on our top line, probably something in the 1%, 2% range kind of as you go through the second half of the year. Obviously, those rates still move around. So those are the primary factors in addition to the healthcare reform. So that said, going the other way, we have a lot of activity on the expense line in the second half that will actually be driving our business going forward. And as we go into 2011, we'll be launching DULERA, we have a lot of activity going on in Japan, launching products, having a lot of success. We will be, obviously, investing in the emerging markets as you've seen announcements, and we'll continue to grow there. And obviously, our pipeline, which is a big driver for us in the future, continues to move forward with very nice progress. So you can expect to see some spending in that in the second half, a little more in the first half. So all those points combine to lead us to our guidance. But the most important thing is we didn't change the midpoint of our guidance range. We just narrowed the range as we've gone through the first half of the year."

BRIDION is having a spectacular launch in Japan, and we look forward to DULERA. So I would just say that SAPHRIS and TREDAPTIVE has not yet become material.

But if you go back to why this is such an important merger to the company, it's far beyond the cost synergies. Cost synergies, in many cases, is an afterthought to why we did this merger and why we're still excited about it. First of all, the most important aspect of this merger that we continue to be excited upon is that it's a late-stage pipeline, and the research synergies from the standpoint that you're -- you have complementary franchises, and there's not much overlap and mechanism of actions, and there's great scientific and technological sharing out that is just so important for the future of the company. So the first and foremost reason why this makes sense moving forward is the scientific and research pipeline and the scientific and research technology that we're sharing across mutual franchises as we move forward. The second part to that is the product portfolio. The excitement that we see from our professional reps country-by-country when we visit there about having now a combined portfolio that can really come up with the right resolution for patients and physicians is just incredible. We're no longer a one trick pony when it comes to some franchises or to these states. We have a portfolio that can meet their needs, and I think that capability is extremely important. And then third, I think is the geographical footprint we have. The geographical footprint that we combined with the two companies, as you know, is critical to the future since we're not and will not be a U.S.-centric company. So when you look at all of those evaluations, to us, those are the most important. And obviously, REMICADE and SIMPONI are important as well, but even without those two, this makes a lot of sense to us."

So we have some really strong launches underway in Japan for key products, and we're very hopeful about ongoing launches as well as the future launches that are upcoming."

Before I turn the call over to Dick Clark, I want to point out a couple of things this morning. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as purchase accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses, restructuring costs. There's also a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. In those GAAP, we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results, and you could see a reconciliation table from the GAAP to non-GAAP figures in our press release. And that'll give you a better sense of the underlying performance. 
Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. There are three tables in the press release. The first table, Table 1, is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to non-GAAP for the third quarter and year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products as if the company have been combined for 2009, as well as 2010. During the call, we'll refer to Tables 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those available.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during the call today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings, as well as our earnings release are available on merck.com. And with that, I'd like to let you know that I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; by Ken Frazier, our President; and also I'm joined by Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.

First, let me say that I'm extremely pleased and proud of all that we have accomplished in such a short period of time. We had consistently focused on achieving the benefits of the combination for patients, customers, shareholders and employees. Most important is furthering the science that underpins Merck's ability to address many of the world's most serious, unmet medical needs.
Today, our company has greater geographic reach, one of the industry's broadest product portfolio, and has a tremendous late-stage pipeline that I believe is second to none. As we mark the anniversary of our merger, I want to thank many Merck colleagues who have helped us manage a significant combination so effectively. Throughout the past year, we have continued to drive revenue growth or key products, improve our cost structure and make the right strategic investments in our business. We've accomplished this while successfully taking on a challenging task of integrating our people, systems and cultures to form a powerful, unified organization. And while we still have work to do, Merck is well positioned now and for the future.
Our solid third quarter 2010 financial results illustrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy. We realized top line worldwide sales of $11.1 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter.
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE were each strong performers this quarter. It is Merck's ability to develop and offer these truly differentiated products that will position us to successfully navigate difficult economies, pricing pressures and challenging regulatory environments throughout the world. In a few moments, Ken will discuss our global product performance in more detail. Peter will then provide you with our full earnings outlook.
While our merger has always been about the science, synergies are also important. We are on track to achieve our previously announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of 2012. As we continue to integrate, there's exciting activity across all of Merck and the world, particularly R&D and commercial strengths at Merck. In coming months and into next year, we expect some important clinical data from promising candidates in our robust pipeline. You will hear more about these milestones in a few moments.
And this pipeline is coming through in other ways too. As we speak, we have 10 major product launches underway in important markets around the world. And just the last few weeks alone, we have received regulatory approval for BRINAVESS in Europe and signed an important partnership agreement to allow Lundbeck to distribute SYCREST in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan. 
Recently, we also marked our first major U.S. product launch as a combined company with the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the widest respiratory portfolio available in the United States. Lastly, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the lightest respiratory portfolio available in the United States. 
Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch meeting, along with our sales and marketing team. It was great to share first-hand the enthusiasm and excitement our sales representatives have to bring this new treatment to our customers. We made excellent progress in the integration of our commercial operations in our major markets throughout the world. Those integrated markets account for about 85% of our Global Human Health sales. It is exciting to see the benefits of our broader, more diversified product portfolio as we engage with physicians and customers. The team is doing an excellent job executing on our commercial sales model in the United States and in key markets in Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our overall goal is to outperform our peer pharmaceutical companies and become the clear industry leader in the eyes of our customers.
In fact, our customer survey for the U.S. market indicates that Merck continues to lead in trust and value metrics versus our peers. Our focus is on positioning Merck to become a leader in the key global growth market, and our broad portfolio of healthcare offerings will drive further growth in these emerging markets. We are currently the fifth-largest multinational pharmaceutical player in a fast-growing emerging markets, and we are aiming much higher. By 2013, we seek to drive at least 25% of our Global Human Health in vaccine sales from the emerging markets. We are making good progress and in the third quarter, that number was 18%. 
Over time, we will build further in these efforts by leveraging our advantage using our broad in-line portfolio. Many of these brands are former blockbusters with considerable brand equity such as ZOCOR. But we're also successful relaunching new products in these markets such as JANUVIA. Additionally, we are seeking to globalize the Vaccine business through growth in emerging markets through partnerships and through the introduction of low-cost manufacturing for some of our key products to expand affordable access.
Finally, we are working to tap the significant growth potential for many of our well-regarded consumer care brands by expanding our operations outside the U.S. In summary, we've made great progress, driving growth of key products, achieving our merger synergies, expanding our global reach, launching new products and advancing our late-stage R&D pipeline. One year post-merger, our results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefit of our merger, while ensuring that the company is well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity fo",1654,"Thank you, Dick, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity for COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our commercial performance this quarter was characterized by continuing strong performance of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE, which was complemented by strong growth in key geographic markets and new contributions from our ongoing product launches such as SIMPONI, BRIDION and AFLURIA. 
Before I review the sales performance, I'd like to refer you to Table 3, which provides the supplemental combined non-GAAP results and includes the impact of foreign exchange. As you review Table 3, you'll see that product sales were driven by the robust growth of our key brands, SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE and ISENTRESS. These brands grew a combined 17% year-over-year. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of some of these key brands starting with SINGULAIR, which grew 12% over the previous year. The increase in sales was driven by growth in most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S. and EU and continued class leadership in Japan. Additionally, SINGULAIR sales in the emerging markets grew 25% in the third quarter. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 28%. Sales this quarter were, again, driven by double-digit growth across most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S., and the franchise continues to grow in the EU due largely to new indications and the ongoing launches of JANUMET.
On a combined basis, JANUVIA and JANUMET are the leading branded oral anti-diabetic franchise in roughly 75% of the top 20 markets. We continue to focus on extending the value of this franchise, and we remain on track for filing a JANUMET once-daily formulation with the FDA next year. Actually, this year, I apologize.
REMICADE sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Despite the austerity measures across the EU, REMICADE continues to grow by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Even in markets where we've seen a good uptake of SIMPONI, REMICADE continues to grow. 
Turning next to ISENTRESS. After three years on the market, it continues to deliver outstanding performance, gaining market share across all indications. ISENTRESS' strong sales growth in the third quarter was driven by the growth in the  treatment-naïve indication and broad utilization of new treatment guidelines in the U.S. We remain on track to file the once-daily dosing regimen with the FDA in 2011.
For the VYTORIN and ZETIA franchise, sales decreased 3% in the third quarter as volume declines in the U.S. were only partially offset by higher sales outside the U.S. The sales growth outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the 30% growth of ZETIA in Japan and 13% growth of VYTORIN in the emerging markets. VYTORIN and ZETIA continue to be an important treatment option to help many patients lower their LDL cholesterol. We understand that researchers from Oxford plan to present the results of the SHARP study at the ASN [American Society of Nephrology] meeting in November. That study, as you know, focus on patients with chronic kidney disease.
Now let's shift to our Vaccine business where we're starting to see signs of progress, including more stable supply. GARDASIL sales grew 2%, benefiting from the timing of shipments to customers. Sales increased sequentially, largely due to the seasonality of the back-to-school period. Sales in PNEUMOVAX were down 15% as a result of the unfavorable seasonal comparison from the H1N1 pandemic last year. We launched our newest vaccine, AFLURIA for the seasonal flu, which posted sales of $35 million in the third quarter. 
We continue to work on the supply issues with ZOSTAVAX. We had limited shipments of the product in Q3, and we anticipate delivering additional shipments to U.S. customers by the end of this year. As you can see, our overall business continues to benefit from the diversity of our product mix and our portfolio of differentiated brands. In addition, our broad global presence is also an asset, providing us with the flexibility to leverage our portfolio in key markets around the world.
In the U.S., sales grew 1% if one excludes the impact of generic erosion for COZAAR and HYZAAR. When you look more closely at the business lines, you'll see that we had double-digit growth in our diabetes franchise, as well as strong growth in our women's health franchise, and we continue to gain market share for products such as ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR. In addition, as Dick mentioned, we are in the process of launching DULERA, our newest treatment for asthma in the U.S. We shipped to pharmacies in July, and we completed our full promotional launch last week. We are encouraged by the early feedback from the field as we focus on the unique attributes of DULERA compared to other combination products.
Now let's turn to the EU, where sales were lower this quarter due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as the impact of European austerity measures. We continue to believe these measures will have a mid-single digit impact on European sales in 2010. Despite those economic challenges, we continue to see strong growth in key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS and REMICADE. We're also launching many new products in the EU. SIMPONI, which has been launched in 18 countries, recorded sales of $27 million in the quarter. While we're still working to gain reimbursement in many markets, the early performance indicators are positive.
We also launched BRINAVESS and DAXAS into markets, and we'll have additional launches of those products in 2011. As I said earlier, we saw good performance in key growth markets. In Japan, sales increased 7%, largely driven by ZETIA and SINGULAIR and the strong launches of BRIDION, COSOPT and JANUVIA are also contributing to our growth in Japan. We continue to focus on our business in Japan as we get ready to file and launch many additional brands over the next three years. We also continue to make significant yet disciplined long-term investments in the emerging markets. 
Growth in the quarter was driven by our top six markets where we saw significant gained from countries such as China, which grew 21% in the quarter. We're approaching each emerging market as a separate opportunity to optimize our product mix as we focus on each local market and its specific customer needs, we've seen an ideal match with our diverse product portfolio. Whether it'd be vaccine, products for cardiometabolic disease or the offerings in our women's health franchise, we're seeing growing utilization of Merck products in the emerging markets.
Now people typically think of branded generics as the only key to success in the emerging markets. But JANUVIA is a great example of how an innovative and differentiated product with the right level of educational and promotional support can become a market leader in the Asia Pacific region. While there's a lot of focus on the emerging markets, one shouldn't forget that science and innovation remain at the core of our business in every part of the world. For us to be successful, we have to continue to discover, develop and launch differentiated products with clinical profiles that offer patients and payers proven benefits.
That's why our late-stage pipeline is so critical to our future. In the fourth quarter, we have data presentations for three of these key late-stage programs, which I'd like to discuss with you briefly now. Last week, at the ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research] meeting, we presented the four-year BMD [bone mineral density] data for odanacatib or selective Cat [Cathepsin] K Inhibitor for the treatment of osteoporosis. Patients on odanacatib continue to show increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip. Odanacatib is currently in Phase III and we will have a long-term fracture study with 16,000 patients, which is fully enrolled. We plan to file odanacatib with regulatory authorities bolstered by that outcome study in 2012.
Starting this weekend and continuing into next week, researchers will present final Phase III data for both boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor at the AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting in Boston. We previously announced the top line results of the Phase III program. In those studies, boceprevir added to the current standard of care, double the cure rate in treatment-experienced patients and nearly double the cure rate in treatment-naïve patients. With the use of response-guided therapy, we also showed that the addition of boceprevir has the potential to shorten the duration of therapy in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients compared to standard therapy. The data that will be presented at the upcoming liver meeting are compelling, and we look forward to sharing them with you.
We remain on track to complete the filing of boceprevir with regulatory authorities around the world this year. Later in November, we will present study result for anacetrapib, our CETP-Inhibitor for the treatment of atherosclerosis at the AHA [American Heart Association] meeting in Chicago. As expected, the results of this study confirmed our decision to move anacetrapib to the planned outcome study that will begin next year. As you can see, we will be presenting a lot of data in the fourth quarter and beyond as we move many of our late-stage research programs forward.
In summary, we've delivered another good quarter. We continue to be excited by the opportunities to grow our business through our current portfolio of products in key markets and through a robust late-stage pipeline, supported by outcome studies. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we are steadily executing on our strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company in the world. 
And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."
288502,113992770,83301,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and con",1395,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and continuing cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and markets performed, and now I'd like to cover our third quarter financial performance and our outlook. So let's begin with our results.
Our GAAP financial information can be found in Table 1 of our release. To make it easier to follow my remarks today, I will speak to the non-GAAP results in Table 2a, which exclude purchase accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges, a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. 
On this basis, we reported third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.1 billion, down 4% on the supplemental combined non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales were actually up about 2%. This is good performance. Despite the unfavorable impact of austerity measures in Europe and the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., and we are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. 
Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. Our Animal Health business grew 3%, 6% FX change to $687 million, reflecting growth in North and South America, as well as growth and poultry, swine and aquaculture. Consumer Care sales also increased 3% to $291 million due to the growth of foot care, respiratory and skin care products. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the impact of generic MiraLAX.
Now moving on to the P&L. You can see that we have done a very good job controlling our expenses again this quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making against our merger synergies, and we are doing so while launching new products and making great progress with the R&D pipeline. As you know, the costs of our combined company are represented in our current cost base. Whereas only the legacy Merck costs were included in the third quarter of 2009, which complicates analysis on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to the sequential trends on the cost line since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
First, materials and production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 74.9%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2010 when the gross margin was 76.5%. As you can see, our gross margin moves a bit quarter-to-quarter mostly due to product mix. This quarter, the mix changes came from a variety of factors, including lower sequential sales of products like NASONEX, CLARINEX and CLARITIN. Sequentially, the second quarter also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact, which did not recur in the third quarter.
Moving on to marketing and admin [administrative] expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $3 billion, which was about $100 million lower than the second quarter of 2010. And on a year-to-year basis, we drove significant cost savings in M&A due to the realization of merger synergies. This was partially tempered by increased promotional spending to support new launches like SIMPONI and DULERA. As you know, we are actively launching many new products, and we expect 2011 to be an exciting year for new product launches in the U.S. and around the world. I'll talk more about that later.
Research and development expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.9 billion, which was slightly lower than the first two quarters due to the continued work we are doing to further prioritize our R&D investments. As a result of the prioritization activities, we decided to stop investment in a few additional programs in the third quarter. We also previously announced the plan to rationalize our R&D network. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in our most promising, late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, boceprevir, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. And these key programs in our pipeline continue to move forward. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the third quarter, Merck recorded $236 million of equity income. As expected, this was sequentially higher than second quarter. Remember the income from the AZLP [AstraZeneca LP] joint venture in the second quarter was low due to the inherent variability in the timing of income from the AZLP joint venture.
Moving on to other expense. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $158 million was comparable to the second quarter of 2010. Our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a legal reserve of $950 million in connection with an anticipated resolution of a previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for District of Massachusetts related to VIOXX. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 22.2% for the third quarter, which was higher than the rate that we saw in the second quarter. As noted in the press release, we continue to expect full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned the cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making continued progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $300 million to repurchase roughly 8 million shares of our common stock. So far this year, we have repurchased about 47 million shares for $1.6 billion. 
So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since our merger. Now let's spend our remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond, and let's start with our 2010 outlook. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we are only making one change to our 2010 financial targets. We raised the lower end of our EPS target range, resulting in an increase in the midpoint of our EPS range. On a non-GAAP basis, Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 EPS range of $3.31 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Please see our press release for the GAAP guidance.
Factored into this EPS range are the top line pressures in the U.S. and the EU, including the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous estimates and the impact of European austerity measures. Recall that we had anticipated a mid-single digit unfavorable impact on European sales in the second half of 2010. We still believe that will be the case.
Our current year EPS range also assumes that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. On the expense side, as I mentioned earlier, we also anticipate increased promotional spending in the fourth quarter and in 2011 for new product launches like DULERA, DAXAS, BRINAVESS and additional launches of SIMPONI around the world, not to mention we are preparing for the prospect of launching boceprevir in 2011. And we continue to make new targeted commercial and R&D investments including those in the emerging markets.
These growth driving investments are a major reason why we expect our operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than they were in the third quarter of 2010. So while these top line pressures and operating investments put pressure on the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with our full year 2010 EPS guidance range. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about our future, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities are already well underway. We continue to target a high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 regardless of the outcome of the REMICADE arbitration. 
In addition, we are well on track to realize our $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. So in closing, we're pleased with the solid third quarter results we reported today. Operational growth in our business, our launch of new products and tight expense management each contributed to our results. We have had a strong performance during our first year of the combined operations, demonstrating that the merger is working, and we are right on track. Thank you.

We have new product launches throughout the world now and so we do sensitivity and scenario planning to be able to accomplish that.

And as I mentioned also that in this quarter, we had about $300 million of share repurchase but on a year-to-date basis, that's $1.3 billion. So I think from the free cash flow of the company, you can see that we're doing good job redeploying cash even this year in the first year of the merger. So that is important to us. That said though, we are very actively looking to make great value creating deals around the world, and I think our business development activity is very active in a number of areas. One is to make sure that we have the best pipeline in the industry. Secondly, looking for great combinations and opportunities to partner around the world on the commercial side. And thirdly, in the emerging markets space, we recognize that we're going to be broadening our footprint and we want to make sure that we work with good partners locally to help create that value. So the BD [ph] size is also active and that does come into play. The last thing I would say is relative to our debt, obviously, what we talked about at the time of the merger was we design the merger to make sure that we landed in about the same place that we were before the merger. And we targeted the credit ratings to allow us to have some flexibility, but to also reinforce the strength of Merck, so that we can handle any kind of issues that come up. But also, more importantly, that we can invest on the strategic opportunities that we have around the world and we intend to continue that. It is true, we are generating solid cash flow and we'll be -- that cash flow performance will be growing. And so we will keep an eye on that. We will be shareholder friendly. But obviously, we will also intend to maintain our credit rating.

We saw, I think, pretty strong revenue number from AZLP this quarter and just wondering what kind of contribution on the revenue, and then the equity income also was quite strong in the quarter. I know these payments are lumpy. But it looks like it brought something to the table here. Also, can you talk about the gross margin weakness in the quarter? What pushed it so low in the quarter? Was it really just kind of mix and seasonality with Schering? Was it the mix of AZLP revenues? And then just the final question really related to AZLP and your long-term guidance. What are the assumptions? Can you just remind us about the assumptions relative to AZLP and the PPI option that AstraZeneca holds for 2012? And I guess when would be the timing of the execution of that option should AstraZeneca actually choose to execute it?"

This is Peter. So first on the AZLP, you've got it right. Obviously, from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, that is an operation that does have inherent variability in the timing of payments and recognition of income, obviously. However, it's a business that continues to do nicely. We haven't really given guidance for these individual businesses and so forth, but there are timing of different seasonality of the products and so forth. On the -- related to that relationship, there is, as you know, in February, there was an option on the non-PPI products that was executed. And you saw a gain in our financials earlier this year from that and obviously, that gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results, it's included in our GAAP results and then some of our tables. The next option timing is two years later. That's for the PPI items, so that'll be roughly in the first part of 2012. And at this point, where we've always assumed that they will exercise that option that said it's their choice and we can't really predict exactly what will happen, but that's the way we thought about it anyway. And then moving to the product gross margins for the quarter, you're right. You put your finger on the two points. One is obviously -- there is some volatility in PGM just naturally because of the mix and some of that mix is because of products or to be -- divisional and so forth, so that does move around a little bit. The other factor that we had in the second and third quarter this year when you compare it in the second and to third quarter was in the same quarter, we did get some foreign exchange benefit and the third quarter that didn't recur. So that also kind of caused the third quarter to look a little weaker versus the second quarter. And obviously the mix also, so we kind of have two factors go against us in the third quarter. I think we have experienced a higher level of volatility in foreign exchange rates this year than normal. And so to that on some timing basis eventually does roll to the cost of goods."

But on a more strategic level, Tony, and I think that's a good question. I think one of the things that Merck will have from a competitive advantage standpoint is that when you look at either governments on an international basis, whether it's a nice type organization or whether we're moving to healthcare reform today and the government's going to play a larger role or whether you're looking to some of the larger managed care payers that exist in the United States. The important part is going to be health technology assessment and the ability to have clinical outcomes and be able to approve that whatever product you're thinking about from a regulatory approval and launch standpoint is above the standard of care that exists today. And I think where our competitive advantage is a company is our late-stage pipeline and how much of it has the ability to meet unmet medical needs and it is differentiated products, and we have the clinical outcome studies to prove it."

Before I turn the call over to Dick Clark, I want to point out a couple of things this morning. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as purchase accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses, restructuring costs. There's also a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. In those GAAP, we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results, and you could see a reconciliation table from the GAAP to non-GAAP figures in our press release. And that'll give you a better sense of the underlying performance. 
Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. There are three tables in the press release. The first table, Table 1, is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to non-GAAP for the third quarter and year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products as if the company have been combined for 2009, as well as 2010. During the call, we'll refer to Tables 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those available.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during the call today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings, as well as our earnings release are available on merck.com. And with that, I'd like to let you know that I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; by Ken Frazier, our President; and also I'm joined by Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.

First, let me say that I'm extremely pleased and proud of all that we have accomplished in such a short period of time. We had consistently focused on achieving the benefits of the combination for patients, customers, shareholders and employees. Most important is furthering the science that underpins Merck's ability to address many of the world's most serious, unmet medical needs.
Today, our company has greater geographic reach, one of the industry's broadest product portfolio, and has a tremendous late-stage pipeline that I believe is second to none. As we mark the anniversary of our merger, I want to thank many Merck colleagues who have helped us manage a significant combination so effectively. Throughout the past year, we have continued to drive revenue growth or key products, improve our cost structure and make the right strategic investments in our business. We've accomplished this while successfully taking on a challenging task of integrating our people, systems and cultures to form a powerful, unified organization. And while we still have work to do, Merck is well positioned now and for the future.
Our solid third quarter 2010 financial results illustrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy. We realized top line worldwide sales of $11.1 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter.
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE were each strong performers this quarter. It is Merck's ability to develop and offer these truly differentiated products that will position us to successfully navigate difficult economies, pricing pressures and challenging regulatory environments throughout the world. In a few moments, Ken will discuss our global product performance in more detail. Peter will then provide you with our full earnings outlook.
While our merger has always been about the science, synergies are also important. We are on track to achieve our previously announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of 2012. As we continue to integrate, there's exciting activity across all of Merck and the world, particularly R&D and commercial strengths at Merck. In coming months and into next year, we expect some important clinical data from promising candidates in our robust pipeline. You will hear more about these milestones in a few moments.
And this pipeline is coming through in other ways too. As we speak, we have 10 major product launches underway in important markets around the world. And just the last few weeks alone, we have received regulatory approval for BRINAVESS in Europe and signed an important partnership agreement to allow Lundbeck to distribute SYCREST in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan. 
Recently, we also marked our first major U.S. product launch as a combined company with the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the widest respiratory portfolio available in the United States. Lastly, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the lightest respiratory portfolio available in the United States. 
Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch meeting, along with our sales and marketing team. It was great to share first-hand the enthusiasm and excitement our sales representatives have to bring this new treatment to our customers. We made excellent progress in the integration of our commercial operations in our major markets throughout the world. Those integrated markets account for about 85% of our Global Human Health sales. It is exciting to see the benefits of our broader, more diversified product portfolio as we engage with physicians and customers. The team is doing an excellent job executing on our commercial sales model in the United States and in key markets in Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our overall goal is to outperform our peer pharmaceutical companies and become the clear industry leader in the eyes of our customers.
In fact, our customer survey for the U.S. market indicates that Merck continues to lead in trust and value metrics versus our peers. Our focus is on positioning Merck to become a leader in the key global growth market, and our broad portfolio of healthcare offerings will drive further growth in these emerging markets. We are currently the fifth-largest multinational pharmaceutical player in a fast-growing emerging markets, and we are aiming much higher. By 2013, we seek to drive at least 25% of our Global Human Health in vaccine sales from the emerging markets. We are making good progress and in the third quarter, that number was 18%. 
Over time, we will build further in these efforts by leveraging our advantage using our broad in-line portfolio. Many of these brands are former blockbusters with considerable brand equity such as ZOCOR. But we're also successful relaunching new products in these markets such as JANUVIA. Additionally, we are seeking to globalize the Vaccine business through growth in emerging markets through partnerships and through the introduction of low-cost manufacturing for some of our key products to expand affordable access.
Finally, we are working to tap the significant growth potential for many of our well-regarded consumer care brands by expanding our operations outside the U.S. In summary, we've made great progress, driving growth of key products, achieving our merger synergies, expanding our global reach, launching new products and advancing our late-stage R&D pipeline. One year post-merger, our results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefit of our merger, while ensuring that the company is well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken.

As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity for COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our commercial performance this quarter was characterized by continuing strong performance of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE, which was complemented by strong growth in key geographic markets and new contributions from our ongoing product launches such as SIMPONI, BRIDION and AFLURIA. 
Before I review the sales performance, I'd like to refer you to Table 3, which provides the supplemental combined non-GAAP results and includes the impact of foreign exchange. As you review Table 3, you'll see that product sales were driven by the robust growth of our key brands, SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE and ISENTRESS. These brands grew a combined 17% year-over-year. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of some of these key brands starting with SINGULAIR, which grew 12% over the previous year. The increase in sales was driven by growth in most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S. and EU and continued class leadership in Japan. Additionally, SINGULAIR sales in the emerging markets grew 25% in the third quarter. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 28%. Sales this quarter were, again, driven by double-digit growth across most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S., and the franchise continues to grow in the EU due largely to new indications and the ongoing launches of JANUMET.
On a combined basis, JANUVIA and JANUMET are the leading branded oral anti-diabetic franchise in roughly 75% of the top 20 markets. We continue to focus on extending the value of this franchise, and we remain on track for filing a JANUMET once-daily formulation with the FDA next year. Actually, this year, I apologize.
REMICADE sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Despite the austerity measures across the EU, REMICADE continues to grow by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Even in markets where we've seen a good uptake of SIMPONI, REMICADE continues to grow. 
Turning next to ISENTRESS. After three years on the market, it continues to deliver outstanding performance, gaining market share across all indications. ISENTRESS' strong sales growth in the third quarter was driven by the growth in the  treatment-naïve indication and broad utilization of new treatment guidelines in the U.S. We remain on track to file the once-daily dosing regimen with the FDA in 2011.
For the VYTORIN and ZETIA franchise, sales decreased 3% in the third quarter as volume declines in the U.S. were only partially offset by higher sales outside the U.S. The sales growth outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the 30% growth of ZETIA in Japan and 13% growth of VYTORIN in the emerging markets. VYTORIN and ZETIA continue to be an important treatment option to help many patients lower their LDL cholesterol. We understand that researchers from Oxford plan to present the results of the SHARP study at the ASN [American Society of Nephrology] meeting in November. That study, as you know, focus on patients with chronic kidney disease.
Now let's shift to our Vaccine business where we're starting to see signs of progress, including more stable supply. GARDASIL sales grew 2%, benefiting from the timing of shipments to customers. Sales increased sequentially, largely due to the seasonality of the back-to-school period. Sales in PNEUMOVAX were down 15% as a result of the unfavorable seasonal comparison from the H1N1 pandemic last year. We launched our newest vaccine, AFLURIA for the seasonal flu, which posted sales of $35 million in the third quarter. 
We continue to work on the supply issues with ZOSTAVAX. We had limited shipments of the product in Q3, and we anticipate delivering additional shipments to U.S. customers by the end of this year. As you can see, our overall business continues to benefit from the diversity of our product mix and our portfolio of differentiated brands. In addition, our broad global presence is also an asset, providing us with the flexibility to leverage our portfolio in key markets around the world.
In the U.S., sales grew 1% if one excludes the impact of generic erosion for COZAAR and HYZAAR. When you look more closely at the business lines, you'll see that we had double-digit growth in our diabetes franchise, as well as strong growth in our women's health franchise, and we continue to gain market share for products such as ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR. In addition, as Dick mentioned, we are in the process of launching DULERA, our newest treatment for asthma in the U.S. We shipped to pharmacies in July, and we completed our full promotional launch last week. We are encouraged by the early feedback from the field as we focus on the unique attributes of DULERA compared to other combination products.
Now let's turn to the EU, where sales were lower this quarter due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as the impact of European austerity measures. We continue to believe these measures will have a mid-single digit impact on European sales in 2010. Despite those economic challenges, we continue to see strong growth in key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS and REMICADE. We're also launching many new products in the EU. SIMPONI, which has been launched in 18 countries, recorded sales of $27 million in the quarter. While we're still working to gain reimbursement in many markets, the early performance indicators are positive.
We also launched BRINAVESS and DAXAS into markets, and we'll have additional launches of those products in 2011. As I said earlier, we saw good performance in key growth markets. In Japan, sales increased 7%, largely driven by ZETIA and SINGULAIR and the strong launches of BRIDION, COSOPT and JANUVIA are also contributing to our growth in Japan. We continue to focus on our business in Japan as we get ready to file and launch many additional brands over the next three years. We also continue to make significant yet disciplined long-term investments in the emerging markets. 
Growth in the quarter was driven by our top six markets where we saw significant gained from countries such as China, which grew 21% in the quarter. We're approaching each emerging market as a separate opportunity to optimize our product mix as we focus on each local market and its specific customer needs, we've seen an ideal match with our diverse product portfolio. Whether it'd be vaccine, products for cardiometabolic disease or the offerings in our women's health franchise, we're seeing growing utilization of Merck products in the emerging markets.
Now people typically think of branded generics as the only key to success in the emerging markets. But JANUVIA is a great example of how an innovative and differentiated product with the right level of educational and promotional support can become a market leader in the Asia Pacific region. While there's a lot of focus on the emerging markets, one shouldn't forget that science and innovation remain at the core of our business in every part of the world. For us to be successful, we have to continue to discover, develop and launch differentiated products with clinical profiles that offer patients and payers proven benefits.
That's why our late-stage pipeline is so critical to our future. In the fourth quarter, we have data presentations for three of these key late-stage programs, which I'd like to discuss with you briefly now. Last week, at the ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research] meeting, we presented the four-year BMD [bone mineral density] data for odanacatib or selective Cat [Cathepsin] K Inhibitor for the treatment of osteoporosis. Patients on odanacatib continue to show increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip. Odanacatib is currently in Phase III and we will have a long-term fracture study with 16,000 patients, which is fully enrolled. We plan to file odanacatib with regulatory authorities bolstered by that outcome study in 2012.
Starting this weekend and continuing into next week, researchers will present final Phase III data for both boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor at the AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting in Boston. We previously announced the top line results of the Phase III program. In those studies, boceprevir added to the current standard of care, double the cure rate in treatment-experienced patients and nearly double the cure rate in treatment-naïve patients. With the use of response-guided therapy, we also showed that the addition of boceprevir has the potential to shorten the duration of therapy in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients compared to standard therapy. The data that will be presented at the upcoming liver meeting are compelling, and we look forward to sharing them with you.
We remain on track to complete the filing of boceprevir with regulatory authorities around the world this year. Later in November, we will present study result for anacetrapib, our CETP-Inhibitor for the treatment of atherosclerosis at the AHA [American Heart Association] meeting in Chicago. As expected, the results of this study confirmed our decision to move anacetrapib to the planned outcome study that will begin next year. As you can see, we will be presenting a lot of data in the fourth quarter and beyond as we move many of our late-stage research programs forward.
In summary, we've delivered another good quarter. We continue to be excited by the opportunities to grow our business through our current portfolio of products in key markets and through a robust late-stage pipeline, supported by outcome studies. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we are steadily executing on our strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company in the world. 
And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.

288502,113992770,83308,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and con",1395,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and continuing cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and markets performed, and now I'd like to cover our third quarter financial performance and our outlook. So let's begin with our results.
Our GAAP financial information can be found in Table 1 of our release. To make it easier to follow my remarks today, I will speak to the non-GAAP results in Table 2a, which exclude purchase accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges, a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. 
On this basis, we reported third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.1 billion, down 4% on the supplemental combined non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales were actually up about 2%. This is good performance. Despite the unfavorable impact of austerity measures in Europe and the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., and we are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. 
Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. Our Animal Health business grew 3%, 6% FX change to $687 million, reflecting growth in North and South America, as well as growth and poultry, swine and aquaculture. Consumer Care sales also increased 3% to $291 million due to the growth of foot care, respiratory and skin care products. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the impact of generic MiraLAX.
Now moving on to the P&L. You can see that we have done a very good job controlling our expenses again this quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making against our merger synergies, and we are doing so while launching new products and making great progress with the R&D pipeline. As you know, the costs of our combined company are represented in our current cost base. Whereas only the legacy Merck costs were included in the third quarter of 2009, which complicates analysis on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to the sequential trends on the cost line since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
First, materials and production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 74.9%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2010 when the gross margin was 76.5%. As you can see, our gross margin moves a bit quarter-to-quarter mostly due to product mix. This quarter, the mix changes came from a variety of factors, including lower sequential sales of products like NASONEX, CLARINEX and CLARITIN. Sequentially, the second quarter also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact, which did not recur in the third quarter.
Moving on to marketing and admin [administrative] expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $3 billion, which was about $100 million lower than the second quarter of 2010. And on a year-to-year basis, we drove significant cost savings in M&A due to the realization of merger synergies. This was partially tempered by increased promotional spending to support new launches like SIMPONI and DULERA. As you know, we are actively launching many new products, and we expect 2011 to be an exciting year for new product launches in the U.S. and around the world. I'll talk more about that later.
Research and development expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.9 billion, which was slightly lower than the first two quarters due to the continued work we are doing to further prioritize our R&D investments. As a result of the prioritization activities, we decided to stop investment in a few additional programs in the third quarter. We also previously announced the plan to rationalize our R&D network. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in our most promising, late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, boceprevir, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. And these key programs in our pipeline continue to move forward. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the third quarter, Merck recorded $236 million of equity income. As expected, this was sequentially higher than second quarter. Remember the income from the AZLP [AstraZeneca LP] joint venture in the second quarter was low due to the inherent variability in the timing of income from the AZLP joint venture.
Moving on to other expense. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $158 million was comparable to the second quarter of 2010. Our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a legal reserve of $950 million in connection with an anticipated resolution of a previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for District of Massachusetts related to VIOXX. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 22.2% for the third quarter, which was higher than the rate that we saw in the second quarter. As noted in the press release, we continue to expect full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned the cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making continued progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $300 million to repurchase roughly 8 million shares of our common stock. So far this year, we have repurchased about 47 million shares for $1.6 billion. 
So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since our merger. Now let's spend our remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond, and let's start with our 2010 outlook. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we are only making one change to our 2010 financial targets. We raised the lower end of our EPS target range, resulting in an increase in the midpoint of our EPS range. On a non-GAAP basis, Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 EPS range of $3.31 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Please see our press release for the GAAP guidance.
Factored into this EPS range are the top line pressures in the U.S. and the EU, including the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous estimates and the impact of European austerity measures. Recall that we had anticipated a mid-single digit unfavorable impact on European sales in the second half of 2010. We still believe that will be the case.
Our current year EPS range also assumes that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. On the expense side, as I mentioned earlier, we also anticipate increased promotional spending in the fourth quarter and in 2011 for new product launches like DULERA, DAXAS, BRINAVESS and additional launches of SIMPONI around the world, not to mention we are preparing for the prospect of launching boceprevir in 2011. And we continue to make new targeted commercial and R&D investments including those in the emerging markets.
These growth driving investments are a major reason why we expect our operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than they were in the third quarter of 2010. So while these top line pressures and operating investments put pressure on the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with our full year 2010 EPS guidance range. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about our future, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities are already well underway. We continue to target a high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 regardless of the outcome of the REMICADE arbitration. 
In addition, we are well on track to realize our $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. So in closing, we're pleased with the solid third quarter results we reported today. Operational growth in our business, our launch of new products and tight expense management each contributed to our results. We have had a strong performance during our first year of the combined operations, demonstrating that the merger is working, and we are right on track. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex. Alex?

One is to make sure that we have the best pipeline in the industry. Secondly, looking for great combinations and opportunities to partner around the world on the commercial side.

The last thing I would say is relative to our debt, obviously, what we talked about at the time of the merger was we design the merger to make sure that we landed in about the same place that we were before the merger. And we targeted the credit ratings to allow us to have some flexibility, but to also reinforce the strength of Merck, so that we can handle any kind of issues that come up. But also, more importantly, that we can invest on the strategic opportunities that we have around the world and we intend to continue that. It is true, we are generating solid cash flow and we'll be -- that cash flow performance will be growing. And so we will keep an eye on that. We will be shareholder friendly. But obviously, we will also intend to maintain our credit rating.

And then a pipeline question on boceprevir. You deployed a strategy for certain assets such as JANUVIA, go-to-market strategy that was pretty quick and pretty rapid. Are you going to use a similar type of strategy on boceprevir? And can you confirm whether the product has been filed or completed the filing as of yet?

But as I've mentioned in my script and in one of the earlier questions, we do remain highly focused on returning cash to shareholders in an appropriate manner, while at the same time, making sure we have the cash to drive the science first mindset we have here. We're very proud of the pipeline in our international footprint. We think we're building a great growth surge of future, and we think that's also the priority for us. And so at this point, I think we are, as I've mentioned, we intend going forward to be very shareholder friendly.

This is Peter. So first on the AZLP, you've got it right. Obviously, from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, that is an operation that does have inherent variability in the timing of payments and recognition of income, obviously. However, it's a business that continues to do nicely. We haven't really given guidance for these individual businesses and so forth, but there are timing of different seasonality of the products and so forth. On the -- related to that relationship, there is, as you know, in February, there was an option on the non-PPI products that was executed. And you saw a gain in our financials earlier this year from that and obviously, that gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results, it's included in our GAAP results and then some of our tables. The next option timing is two years later. That's for the PPI items, so that'll be roughly in the first part of 2012. And at this point, where we've always assumed that they will exercise that option that said it's their choice and we can't really predict exactly what will happen, but that's the way we thought about it anyway. And then moving to the product gross margins for the quarter, you're right. You put your finger on the two points. One is obviously -- there is some volatility in PGM just naturally because of the mix and some of that mix is because of products or to be -- divisional and so forth, so that does move around a little bit. The other factor that we had in the second and third quarter this year when you compare it in the second and to third quarter was in the same quarter, we did get some foreign exchange benefit and the third quarter that didn't recur. So that also kind of caused the third quarter to look a little weaker versus the second quarter. And obviously the mix also, so we kind of have two factors go against us in the third quarter. I think we have experienced a higher level of volatility in foreign exchange rates this year than normal. And so to that on some timing basis eventually does roll to the cost of goods.

But on a more strategic level, Tony, and I think that's a good question. I think one of the things that Merck will have from a competitive advantage standpoint is that when you look at either governments on an international basis, whether it's a nice type organization or whether we're moving to healthcare reform today and the government's going to play a larger role or whether you're looking to some of the larger managed care payers that exist in the United States. The important part is going to be health technology assessment and the ability to have clinical outcomes and be able to approve that whatever product you're thinking about from a regulatory approval and launch standpoint is above the standard of care that exists today. And I think where our competitive advantage is a company is our late-stage pipeline and how much of it has the ability to meet unmet medical needs and it is differentiated products, and we have the clinical outcome studies to prove it.

Before I turn the call over to Dick Clark, I wanted to point out a couple of things this morning. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as purchase accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses, restructuring costs. There's also a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. In those GAAP, we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results, and you could see a reconciliation table from the GAAP to non-GAAP figures in our press release. And that'll give you a better sense of the underlying performance. 
Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. There are three tables in the press release. The first table, Table 1, is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to non-GAAP for the third quarter and year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products as if the company have been combined for 2009, as well as 2010. During the call, we'll refer to Tables 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those available.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during the call today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings, as well as our earnings release are available on merck.com. And with that, I'd like to let you know that I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; by Ken Frazier, our President; and also I'm joined by Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.

First, let me say that I'm extremely pleased and proud of all that we have accomplished in such a short period of time. We have consistently focused on achieving the benefits of the combination for patients, customers, shareholders and employees. Most important is furthering the science that underpins Merck's ability to address many of the world's most serious, unmet medical needs.
Today, our company has greater geographic reach, one of the industry's broadest product portfolio, and has a tremendous late-stage pipeline that I believe is second to none. As we mark the anniversary of our merger, I want to thank many Merck colleagues who have helped us manage this significant combination so effectively. Throughout the past year, we have continued to drive revenue growth for key products, improve our cost structure and make the right strategic investments in our business. We've accomplished this while successfully taking on the challenging task of integrating our people, systems and cultures to form a powerful, unified organization. And while we still have work to do, Merck is well positioned now and for the future.
Our solid third quarter 2010 financial results illustrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy. We realized top line worldwide sales of $11.1 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter.
Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE were each strong performers this quarter. It is Merck's ability to develop and offer these truly differentiated products that will position us to successfully navigate difficult economies, pricing pressures and challenging regulatory environments throughout the world. In a few moments, Ken will discuss our global product performance in more detail. Peter will then provide you with our full earnings outlook.
While our merger has always been about the science, synergies are also important. We are on track to achieve our previously announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of 2012. As we continue to integrate, there's exciting activity across all of Merck and the world, particularly R&D and commercial strengths at Merck. In coming months and into next year, we expect some important clinical data from promising candidates in our robust pipeline. You will hear more about these milestones in a few moments.
And this pipeline is coming through in other ways too. As we speak, we have 10 major product launches underway in important markets around the world. In just the last few weeks alone, we have received regulatory approval for BRINAVESS in Europe and signed an important partnership agreement to allow Lundbeck to distribute SYCREST in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan. 
Recently, we also marked our first major U.S. product launch as a combined company with the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the widest respiratory portfolio available in the United States.  Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch meeting, along with our sales and marketing team. It was great to share first-hand the enthusiasm and excitement our sales representatives have to bring this new treatment to our customers. We made excellent progress in the integration of our commercial operations in our major markets throughout the world. Those integrated markets account for about 85% of our Global Human Health sales. It is exciting to see the benefits of our broader, more diversified product portfolio as we engage with physicians and customers. The team is doing an excellent job executing on our commercial sales model in the United States and in key markets in Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our overall goal is to outperform our peer pharmaceutical companies and become the clear industry leader in the eyes of our customers.
In fact, our customer survey for the U.S. market indicates that Merck continues to lead in trust and value metrics versus our peers. Our focus is on positioning Merck to become a leader in the key global growth markets, and our broad portfolio of healthcare offerings will drive further growth in these emerging markets. We are currently the fifth-largest multinational pharmaceutical player in a fast-growing emerging markets, and we are aiming much higher. By 2013, we seek to derive at least 25% of our Global Human Health in vaccine sales from the emerging markets. We are making good progress and in the third quarter, that number was 18%. 
Over time, we will build further in these efforts by leveraging our advantage using our broad in-line portfolio. Many of these brands are former blockbusters with considerable brand equity such as ZOCOR. But we were also successful relaunching new products in these markets such as JANUVIA. Additionally, we are seeking to globalize the Vaccine business through growth in emerging markets through partnerships and through the introduction of low-cost manufacturing for some of our key products to expand affordable access.
Finally, we are working to tap the significant growth potential for many of our well-regarded consumer care brands by expanding our operations outside the U.S. In summary, we've made great progress, driving growth of key products, achieving our merger synergies, expanding our global reach, launching new products and advancing our late-stage R&D pipeline. One year post-merger, our results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefit of our merger, while ensuring that the company is well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity for COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our commercial performance this quarter was characterized by continuing strong performance of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE, which was complemented by strong growth in key geographic markets and new contributions from our ongoing product launches such as SIMPONI, BRIDION and AFLURIA. 
Before I review the sales performance, I'd like to refer you to Table 3, which provides the supplemental combined non-GAAP results and includes the impact of foreign exchange. As you review Table 3, you'll see that product sales were driven by the robust growth of our key brands, SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE and ISENTRESS. These brands grew a combined 17% year-over-year. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of some of these key brands starting with SINGULAIR, which grew 12% over the previous year. The increase in sales was driven by growth in most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S. and EU and continued class leadership in Japan. Additionally, SINGULAIR sales in the emerging markets grew 25% in the third quarter. 
Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 28%. Sales this quarter were, again, driven by double-digit growth across most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S., and the franchise continues to grow in the EU due largely to new indications and the ongoing launches of JANUMET.
On a combined basis, JANUVIA and JANUMET are the leading branded oral anti-diabetic franchise in roughly 75% of the top 20 markets. We continue to focus on extending the value of this franchise, and we remain on track for filing a JANUMET once-daily formulation with the FDA next year. Actually, this year, I apologize.
REMICADE sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Despite the austerity measures across the EU, REMICADE continues to grow by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Even in markets where we've seen a good uptake of SIMPONI, REMICADE continues to grow. 
Turning next to ISENTRESS. After three years on the market, it continues to deliver outstanding performance, gaining market share across all indications. ISENTRESS' strong sales growth in the third quarter was driven by the growth in the treatment-naïve indication and broad utilization of new treatment guidelines in the U.S. We remain on track to file the once-daily dosing regimen with the FDA in 2011.
For the VYTORIN and ZETIA franchise, sales decreased 3% in the third quarter as volume declines in the U.S. were only partially offset by higher sales outside the U.S. The sales growth outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the 30% growth of ZETIA in Japan and 13% growth of VYTORIN in the emerging markets. VYTORIN and ZETIA continue to be an important treatment option to help many patients lower their LDL cholesterol. We understand that researchers from Oxford plan to present the results of the SHARP study at the ASN [American Society of Nephrology] meeting in November. That study, as you know, focused on patients with chronic kidney disease.
Now let's shift to our Vaccine business where we're starting to see signs of progress, including more stable supply. GARDASIL sales grew 2%, benefiting from the timing of shipments to customers. Sales increased sequentially, largely due to the seasonality of the back-to-school period. Sales in PNEUMOVAX were down 15% as a result of the unfavorable seasonal comparison from the H1N1 pandemic last year. We launched our newest vaccine, AFLURIA for the seasonal flu, which posted sales of $35 million in the third quarter. 
We continue to work on the supply issues for ZOSTAVAX. We had limited shipment for the product in Q3, and we anticipate delivering additional shipments to U.S. customers by the end of this year. As you can see, our overall business continues to benefit from the diversity of our product mix and our portfolio of differentiated brands. In addition, our broad global presence is also an asset, providing us with the flexibility to leverage our portfolio in key markets around the world.
In the U.S., sales grew 1% if one excludes the impact of generic erosion for COZAAR and HYZAAR. When you look more closely at the business lines, you'll see that we had double-digit growth in our diabetes franchise, as well as strong growth in our women's health franchise, and we continue to gain market share for products such as ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR. In addition, as Dick mentioned, we are in the process of launching DULERA, our newest treatment for asthma in the U.S. We shipped to pharmacies in July, and we completed our full promotional launch last week. We are encouraged by the early feedback from the field as we focus on the unique attributes of DULERA compared to other combination products.
Now let's turn to the EU, where sales were lower this quarter due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as the impact of European austerity measures. We continue to believe these measures will have a mid-single digit impact on European sales in 2010. Despite those economic challenges, we continue to see strong growth in key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS and REMICADE. We're also launching many new products in the EU. SIMPONI, which has been launched in 18 countries, recorded sales of $27 million in the quarter. While we're still working to gain reimbursement in many markets, the early performance indicators are positive.
We also launched BRINAVESS and DAXAS in two markets, and we'll have additional launches of those products in 2011. As I said earlier, we saw good performance in key growth markets. In Japan, sales increased 7%, largely driven by ZETIA and SINGULAIR and the strong launches of BRIDION, COSOPT and JANUVIA are also contributing to our growth in Japan. We continue to focus on our business in Japan as we get ready to file and launch many additional brands over the next three years. We also continue to make significant yet disciplined long-term investments in the emerging markets. 
Growth in the quarter was driven by our top six markets where we saw significant gains from countries such as China, which grew 21% in the quarter. We're approaching each emerging market as a separate opportunity to optimize our product mix.  As we focused on each local market and its specific customer needs, we've seen an ideal match with our diverse product portfolio. Whether it'd be vaccines, products for cardiometabolic disease or the offerings in our women's health franchise, we're seeing growing utilization of Merck products in the emerging markets.
Now people typically think of branded generics as the only key to success in the emerging markets. But JANUVIA is a great example of how an innovative and differentiated product with the right level of educational and promotional support can become a market leader in the Asia Pacific region. While there's a lot of focus on the emerging markets, one shouldn't forget that science and innovation remain at the core of our business in every part of the world. For us to be successful, we have to continue to discover, develop and launch differentiated products with clinical profiles that offer patients and payers proven benefits.
That's why our late-stage pipeline is so critical to our future. In the fourth quarter, we have data presentations for three of these key late-stage programs, which I'd like to discuss with you briefly now. Last week, at the ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research] meeting, we presented the four-year BMD [bone mineral density] data for odanacatib or selective Cat [Cathepsin] K Inhibitor for the treatment of osteoporosis. Patients on odanacatib continue to show increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip. Odanacatib is currently in Phase III and we will have a long-term fracture study with 16,000 patients, which is fully enrolled. We plan to file odanacatib with regulatory authorities bolstered by that outcome study in 2012.
Starting this weekend and continuing into next week, researchers will present final Phase III data for boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor at the AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting in Boston. We previously announced the top line results of the Phase III program. In those studies, boceprevir added to the current standard of care, double the cure rate in treatment-experienced patients and nearly double the cure rate in treatment-naïve patients. With the use of response-guided therapy, we also showed that the addition of boceprevir has the potential to shorten the duration of therapy in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients compared to standard therapy. The data that will be presented at the upcoming liver meeting are compelling, and we look forward to sharing them with you.
We remain on track to complete the filing of boceprevir with regulatory authorities around the world this year. Later in November, we will present study results for anacetrapib, our CETP-Inhibitor for the treatment of atherosclerosis at the AHA [American Heart Association] meeting in Chicago. As expected, the results of this study confirmed our decision to move anacetrapib to the planned outcome study that will begin next year. As you can see, we will be presenting a lot of data in the fourth quarter and beyond as we move many of our late-stage research programs forward.
In summary, we've delivered another good quarter. We continue to be excited by the opportunities to grow our business through our current portfolio of products in key markets and through our robust late-stage pipeline, supported by outcome studies. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we are steadily executing on our strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company in the world. 
And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg."

As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and con",1395,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and continuing cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and markets performed, and now I'd like to cover our third quarter financial performance and our outlook. So let's begin with our results.
Our GAAP financial information can be found in Table 1 of our release. To make it easier to follow my remarks today, I will speak to the non-GAAP results in Table 2a, which exclude purchase accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges, a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. 
On this basis, we reported third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.1 billion, down 4% on the supplemental combined non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales were actually up about 2%. This is good performance. Despite the unfavorable impact of austerity measures in Europe and the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., and we are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. 
Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. Our Animal Health business grew 3%, 6% FX change to $687 million, reflecting growth in North and South America, as well as growth in poultry, swine and aquaculture. Consumer Care sales also increased 3% to $291 million due to the growth of foot care, respiratory and skin care products. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the impact of generic MiraLAX.
Now moving on to the P&L. You can see that we have done a very good job controlling our expenses again this quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making against our merger synergies, and we are doing so while launching new products and making great progress with the R&D pipeline. As you know, the costs of our combined company are represented in our current cost base. Whereas only the legacy Merck costs were included in the third quarter of 2009, which complicates analysis on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to the sequential trends on the cost line since those comparisons are more meaningful. 
First, materials and production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 74.9%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2010 when the gross margin was 76.5%. As you can see, our gross margin moves a bit quarter-to-quarter mostly due to product mix. This quarter, the mix changes came from a variety of factors, including lower sequential sales of products like NASONEX, CLARINEX and CLARITIN. Sequentially, the second quarter also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact, which did not recur in the third quarter.
Moving on to marketing and admin [administrative] expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $3 billion, which was about $100 million lower than the second quarter of 2010. And on a year-to-year basis, we drove significant cost savings in M&A due to the realization of merger synergies. This was partially tempered by increased promotional spending to support new launches like SIMPONI and DULERA. As you know, we are actively launching many new products, and we expect 2011 to be an exciting year for new product launches in the U.S. and around the world. I'll talk more about that later.
Research and development expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.9 billion, which was slightly lower than the first two quarters due to the continued work we are doing to further prioritize our R&D investments. As a result of the prioritization activities, we decided to stop investment in a few additional programs in the third quarter. We also previously announced the plan to rationalize our R&D network. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in our most promising, late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, boceprevir, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. And these key programs in our pipeline continue to move forward. 
Now let's move to equity income. In the third quarter, Merck recorded $236 million of equity income. As expected, this was sequentially higher than second quarter. Remember the income from the AZLP [AstraZeneca LP] joint venture in the second quarter was low due to the inherent variability in the timing of income from the AZLP joint venture.
Moving on to other expense. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $158 million was comparable to the second quarter of 2010. Our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a legal reserve of $950 million in connection with an anticipated resolution of the previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for District of Massachusetts related to VIOXX. 
Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 22.2% for the third quarter, which was higher than the rate that we saw in the second quarter. As noted in the press release, we continue to expect full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned the cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making continued progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $300 million to repurchase roughly 8 million shares of our common stock. So far this year, we have repurchased about 47 million shares for $1.6 billion. 
So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since our merger. Now let's spend our remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond, and let's start with our 2010 outlook. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we are only making one change to our 2010 financial targets. We raised the lower end of our EPS target range, resulting in an increase in the midpoint of our EPS range. On a non-GAAP basis, Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 EPS range of $3.31 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Please see our press release for the GAAP guidance.
Factored into this EPS range are the top line pressures in the U.S. and the EU, including the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous estimates and the impact of European austerity measures. Recall that we had anticipated a mid-single digit unfavorable impact on European sales in the second half of 2010. We still believe that will be the case.
Our current year EPS range also assumes that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. On the expense side, as I mentioned earlier, we also anticipate increased promotional spending in the fourth quarter and in 2011 for new product launches like DULERA, DAXAS, BRINAVESS and additional launches of SIMPONI around the world, not to mention we are preparing for the prospect of launching boceprevir in 2011. And we continue to make new targeted commercial and R&D investments including those in the emerging markets.
These growth driving investments are a major reason why we expect our operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than they were in the third quarter of 2010. So while these top line pressures and operating investments put pressure on the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with our full year 2010 EPS guidance range. 
Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about our future, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities are already well underway. We continue to target a high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 regardless of the outcome of the REMICADE arbitration. 
In addition, we are well on track to realize our $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. So in closing, we're pleased with the solid third quarter results we reported today. Operational growth in our business, our launch of new products and tight expense management each contributed to our results. We have had a strong performance during our first year of the combined operations, demonstrating that the merger is working, and we are right on track. Thank you.

So I think from the free cash flow of the company, you can see that we're doing a good job redeploying cash even this year in the first year of the merger. So that is important to us. That said though, we are very actively looking to make great value creating deals around the world, and I think our business development activity is very active in a number of areas. One is to make sure that we have the best pipeline in the industry. Secondly, looking for great combinations and opportunities to partner around the world on the commercial side. And thirdly, in the emerging markets space, we recognize that we're going to be broadening our footprint and we want to make sure that we work with good partners locally to help create that value. So the BD [ph] size is also active and that does come into play. The last thing I would say is relative to our debt, obviously, what we talked about at the time of the merger was that we designed the merger to make sure that we landed in about the same place that we were before the merger. And we targeted the credit ratings to allow us to have some flexibility, but to also reinforce the strength of Merck, so that we can handle any kind of issues that come up. But also, more importantly, that we can invest on the strategic opportunities that we have around the world and we intend to continue that. It is true, we are generating solid cash flow and we'll be -- that cash flow performance will be growing. And so we will keep an eye on that and we will be shareholder friendly. But obviously, we will also intend to maintain our credit rating.

This is Peter. So first on the AZLP, you've got it right. Obviously, from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, that is an operation that does have inherent variability in the timing of payments and recognition of income, obviously. However, it's a business that continues to do nicely. We haven't really given guidance for these individual businesses and so forth, but there are timing of different seasonality of the products and so forth. On the -- related to that relationship, there is, as you know, in February, there was an option on the non-PPI products that was executed. And you saw a gain in our financials earlier this year from that and obviously, that gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results, but you can see it in our GAAP results and in some of our tables. The next option timing is two years later. That's for the PPI items, so that would be roughly in the first part of 2012. And at this point, where we've always assumed that they would exercise that option that said it's their choice and we can't really predict exactly what will happen, but that's the way we've always thought about it anyway. And then moving to the product gross margins for the quarter, you're right. You put your finger on the two points. One is obviously -- there is some volatility in PGM just naturally because of the mix and some of that mix is because of products or it could be divisional and so forth, so that does move around a little bit. The other factor that we had in the second and third quarter this year when you compare it from the second and to third quarter was in the second quarter, we did get some foreign exchange benefit and the third quarter that didn't recur. So that also kind of caused the third quarter to look a little weaker versus the second quarter. And obviously the mix also, so we kind of have two factors go against us in the third quarter. I think we have experienced a higher level of volatility in foreign exchange rates this year than normal. And so as to that on some timing basis eventually does roll to the cost of goods."

But on a more strategic level, Tony, and I think that's a good question. I think one of the things that Merck will have from a competitive advantage standpoint is that when you look at either governments on an international basis, whether it's a nice type organization or whether we're moving to healthcare reform today and the government's going to play a larger role or whether you're looking to some of the larger managed care payers that exist in the United States. The important part is going to be health technology assessment and the ability to have clinical outcomes and be able to approve that whatever product you're thinking about from a regulatory approval and launch standpoint is above the standard of care that exists today. And I think where our competitive advantage is as a company is our late-stage pipeline and how much of it has the ability to meet unmet medical needs and it is differentiated products, and we have the clinical outcome studies to prove it."

Before I turn the call over to Dick Clark, I want to point out a couple of things this morning. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as purchase accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses, restructuring costs. There's also a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve. In those GAAP, we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results, and you could see a reconciliation table from the GAAP to non-GAAP figures in our press release. And that'll give you a better sense of the underlying performance.
 Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. There are three tables in the press release. The first table, Table 1, is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to non-GAAP for the third quarter and year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for the company, the business units and the products as if the company have been combined for 2009, as well as 2010. During the call, we'll refer to Tables 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 for the revenue performance. So you may want to have those available.
 Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during the call today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
 Our SEC filings, as well as our earnings release are available on merck.com. And with that, I'd like to let you know that I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; by Ken Frazier, our President; and also I'm joined by Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.
 Now I'd like to introduce Dick Clark.

First, let me say that I'm extremely pleased and proud of all that we have accomplished in such a short period of time. We had consistently focused on achieving the benefits of the combination for patients, customers, shareholders and employees. Most important is furthering the science that underpins Merck's ability to address many of the world's most serious, unmet medical needs.
 Today, our company has greater geographic reach, one of the industry's broadest product portfolio, and has a tremendous late-stage pipeline that I believe is second to none. As we mark the anniversary of our merger, I want to thank many Merck colleagues who have helped us manage a significant combination so effectively. Throughout the past year, we have continued to drive revenue growth or key products, improve our cost structure and make the right strategic investments in our business. We've accomplished this while successfully taking on a challenging task of integrating our people, systems and cultures to form a powerful, unified organization. And while we still have work to do, Merck is well positioned now and for the future.
 Our solid third quarter 2010 financial results illustrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy. We realized top line worldwide sales of $11.1 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 and GAAP earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter.
 Key brands including JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE were each strong performers this quarter. It is Merck's ability to develop and offer these truly differentiated products that will position us to successfully navigate difficult economies, pricing pressures and challenging regulatory environments throughout the world. In a few moments, Ken will discuss our global product performance in more detail. Peter will then provide you with our full earnings outlook.
 While our merger has always been about the science, synergies are also important. We are on track to achieve our previously announced synergy target of $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of 2012. As we continue to integrate, there's exciting activity across all of Merck and the world, particularly R&D and commercial strengths at Merck. In coming months and into next year, we expect some important clinical data from promising candidates in our robust pipeline. You will hear more about these milestones in a few moments.
 And this pipeline is coming through in other ways too. As we speak, we have 10 major product launches underway in important markets around the world. And just the last few weeks alone, we have received regulatory approval for BRINAVESS in Europe and signed an important partnership agreement to allow Lundbeck to distribute SYCREST in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan.
 Recently, we also marked our first major U.S. product launch as a combined company with the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the widest respiratory portfolio available in the United States. Lastly, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch. With the addition of this exciting new asthma product, Merck now has the lightest respiratory portfolio available in the United States.
 Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in the DULERA launch meeting, along with our sales and marketing team. It was great to share first-hand the enthusiasm and excitement our sales representatives have to bring this new treatment to our customers. We made excellent progress in the integration of our commercial operations in our major markets throughout the world. Those integrated markets account for about 85% of our Global Human Health sales. It is exciting to see the benefits of our broader, more diversified product portfolio as we engage with physicians and customers. The team is doing an excellent job executing on our commercial sales model in the United States and in key markets in Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our overall goal is to outperform our peer pharmaceutical companies and become the clear industry leader in the eyes of our customers.
 In fact, our customer survey for the U.S. market indicates that Merck continues to lead in trust and value metrics versus our peers. Our focus is on positioning Merck to become a leader in the key global growth market, and our broad portfolio of healthcare offerings will drive further growth in these emerging markets. We are currently the fifth-largest multinational pharmaceutical player in a fast-growing emerging markets, and we are aiming much higher. By 2013, we seek to drive at least 25% of our Global Human Health in vaccine sales from the emerging markets. We are making good progress and in the third quarter, that number was 18%.
 Over time, we will build further in these efforts by leveraging our advantage using our broad in-line portfolio. Many of these brands are former blockbusters with considerable brand equity such as ZOCOR. But we're also successful relaunching new products in these markets such as JANUVIA. Additionally, we are seeking to globalize the Vaccine business through growth in emerging markets through partnerships and through the introduction of low-cost manufacturing for some of our key products to expand affordable access.
 Finally, we are working to tap the significant growth potential for many of our well-regarded consumer care brands by expanding our operations outside the U.S. In summary, we've made great progress, driving growth of key products, achieving our merger synergies, expanding our global reach, launching new products and advancing our late-stage R&D pipeline. One year post-merger, our results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefit of our merger, while ensuring that the company is well positioned for the future.
 Now I'll turn it over to Ken.

288502,113992770,86619,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives"," Thank you, Dick, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity f",1654," Thank you, Dick, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. As Dick mentioned, we had another successful quarter with Global Human Health reporting sales of $9.7 billion despite the economic challenges in many markets and the loss of exclusivity for COZAAR and HYZAAR. Our commercial performance this quarter was characterized by continuing strong performance of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS and REMICADE, which was complemented by strong growth in key geographic markets and new contributions from our ongoing product launches such as SIMPONI, BRIDION and AFLURIA.
 Before I review the sales performance, I'd like to refer you to Table 3, which provides the supplemental combined non-GAAP results and includes the impact of foreign exchange. As you review Table 3, you'll see that product sales were driven by the robust growth of our key brands, SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE and ISENTRESS. These brands grew a combined 17% year-over-year.
 Now let's take a closer look at the performance of some of these key brands starting with SINGULAIR, which grew 12% over the previous year. The increase in sales was driven by growth in most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S. and EU and continued class leadership in Japan. Additionally, SINGULAIR sales in the emerging markets grew 25% in the third quarter.
 Moving on to JANUVIA and JANUMET. Global revenue grew 28%. Sales this quarter were, again, driven by double-digit growth across most regions. We continue to see volume growth in the U.S., and the franchise continues to grow in the EU due largely to new indications and the ongoing launches of JANUMET.
 On a combined basis, JANUVIA and JANUMET are the leading branded oral anti-diabetic franchise in roughly 75% of the top 20 markets. We continue to focus on extending the value of this franchise, and we remain on track for filing a JANUMET once-daily formulation with the FDA next year. Actually, this year, I apologize.
 REMICADE sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Despite the austerity measures across the EU, REMICADE continues to grow by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Even in markets where we've seen a good uptake of SIMPONI, REMICADE continues to grow.
 Turning next to ISENTRESS. After three years on the market, it continues to deliver outstanding performance, gaining market share across all indications. ISENTRESS' strong sales growth in the third quarter was driven by the growth in the  treatment-naïve indication and broad utilization of new treatment guidelines in the U.S. We remain on track to file the once-daily dosing regimen with the FDA in 2011.
 For the VYTORIN and ZETIA franchise, sales decreased 3% in the third quarter as volume declines in the U.S. were only partially offset by higher sales outside the U.S. The sales growth outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the 30% growth of ZETIA in Japan and 13% growth of VYTORIN in the emerging markets. VYTORIN and ZETIA continue to be an important treatment option to help many patients lower their LDL cholesterol. We understand that researchers from Oxford plan to present the results of the SHARP study at the ASN [American Society of Nephrology] meeting in November. That study, as you know, focus on patients with chronic kidney disease.
 Now let's shift to our Vaccine business where we're starting to see signs of progress, including more stable supply. GARDASIL sales grew 2%, benefiting from the timing of shipments to customers. Sales increased sequentially, largely due to the seasonality of the back-to-school period. Sales in PNEUMOVAX were down 15% as a result of the unfavorable seasonal comparison from the H1N1 pandemic last year. We launched our newest vaccine, AFLURIA for the seasonal flu, which posted sales of $35 million in the third quarter.
 We continue to work on the supply issues with ZOSTAVAX. We had limited shipments of the product in Q3, and we anticipate delivering additional shipments to U.S. customers by the end of this year. As you can see, our overall business continues to benefit from the diversity of our product mix and our portfolio of differentiated brands. In addition, our broad global presence is also an asset, providing us with the flexibility to leverage our portfolio in key markets around the world.
 In the U.S., sales grew 1% if one excludes the impact of generic erosion for COZAAR and HYZAAR. When you look more closely at the business lines, you'll see that we had double-digit growth in our diabetes franchise, as well as strong growth in our women's health franchise, and we continue to gain market share for products such as ISENTRESS and SINGULAIR. In addition, as Dick mentioned, we are in the process of launching DULERA, our newest treatment for asthma in the U.S. We shipped to pharmacies in July, and we completed our full promotional launch last week. We are encouraged by the early feedback from the field as we focus on the unique attributes of DULERA compared to other combination products.
 Now let's turn to the EU, where sales were lower this quarter due to the loss of exclusivity of COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as the impact of European austerity measures. We continue to believe these measures will have a mid-single digit impact on European sales in 2010. Despite those economic challenges, we continue to see strong growth in key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS and REMICADE. We're also launching many new products in the EU. SIMPONI, which has been launched in 18 countries, recorded sales of $27 million in the quarter. While we're still working to gain reimbursement in many markets, the early performance indicators are positive.
 We also launched BRINAVESS and DAXAS into markets, and we'll have additional launches of those products in 2011. As I said earlier, we saw good performance in key growth markets. In Japan, sales increased 7%, largely driven by ZETIA and SINGULAIR and the strong launches of BRIDION, COSOPT and JANUVIA are also contributing to our growth in Japan. We continue to focus on our business in Japan as we get ready to file and launch many additional brands over the next three years. We also continue to make significant yet disciplined long-term investments in the emerging markets.
 Growth in the quarter was driven by our top six markets where we saw significant gained from countries such as China, which grew 21% in the quarter. We're approaching each emerging market as a separate opportunity to optimize our product mix as we focus on each local market and its specific customer needs, we've seen an ideal match with our diverse product portfolio. Whether it'd be vaccine, products for cardiometabolic disease or the offerings in our women's health franchise, we're seeing growing utilization of Merck products in the emerging markets.
 Now people typically think of branded generics as the only key to success in the emerging markets. But JANUVIA is a great example of how an innovative and differentiated product with the right level of educational and promotional support can become a market leader in the Asia Pacific region. While there's a lot of focus on the emerging markets, one shouldn't forget that science and innovation remain at the core of our business in every part of the world. For us to be successful, we have to continue to discover, develop and launch differentiated products with clinical profiles that offer patients and payers proven benefits.
 That's why our late-stage pipeline is so critical to our future. In the fourth quarter, we have data presentations for three of these key late-stage programs, which I'd like to discuss with you briefly now. Last week, at the ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research] meeting, we presented the four-year BMD [bone mineral density] data for odanacatib or selective Cat [Cathepsin] K Inhibitor for the treatment of osteoporosis. Patients on odanacatib continue to show increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip. Odanacatib is currently in Phase III and we will have a long-term fracture study with 16,000 patients, which is fully enrolled. We plan to file odanacatib with regulatory authorities bolstered by that outcome study in 2012.
 Starting this weekend and continuing into next week, researchers will present final Phase III data for both boceprevir, our hepatitis C protease inhibitor at the AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting in Boston. We previously announced the top line results of the Phase III program. In those studies, boceprevir added to the current standard of care, double the cure rate in treatment-experienced patients and nearly double the cure rate in treatment-naïve patients. With the use of response-guided therapy, we also showed that the addition of boceprevir has the potential to shorten the duration of therapy in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients compared to standard therapy. The data that will be presented at the upcoming liver meeting are compelling, and we look forward to sharing them with you.
 We remain on track to complete the filing of boceprevir with regulatory authorities around the world this year. Later in November, we will present study result for anacetrapib, our CETP-Inhibitor for the treatment of atherosclerosis at the AHA [American Heart Association] meeting in Chicago. As expected, the results of this study confirmed our decision to move anacetrapib to the planned outcome study that will begin next year. As you can see, we will be presenting a lot of data in the fourth quarter and beyond as we move many of our late-stage research programs forward.
 In summary, we've delivered another good quarter. We continue to be excited by the opportunities to grow our business through our current portfolio of products in key markets and through a robust late-stage pipeline, supported by outcome studies. While the operating environment is constantly changing, we are steadily executing on our strategic goals to create the leading healthcare company in the world.
 And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.

288502,113992770,86619,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives"," Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and co",1395," Thank you, Ken, and good morning. As you've heard from Dick and Ken, our performance this quarter was, once again, characterized by solid operating performance in our business, which continues to help offset the impact of generic COZAAR and HYZAAR and continuing cost management and benefits of merger synergies in our cost base. Ken discussed how our key brands and markets performed, and now I'd like to cover our third quarter financial performance and our outlook. So let's begin with our results.
 Our GAAP financial information can be found in Table 1 of our release. To make it easier to follow my remarks today, I will speak to the non-GAAP results in Table 2a, which exclude purchase accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, restructuring charges, a $380 million tax benefit and a $950 million legal reserve.
 On this basis, we reported third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85. Total revenue for the quarter was $11.1 billion, down 4% on the supplemental combined non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of generic COZAAR/HYZAAR and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales were actually up about 2%. This is good performance. Despite the unfavorable impact of austerity measures in Europe and the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., and we are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses.
 Ken discussed our Global Human Health sales, so let me just comment on our Animal Health and Consumer businesses. Our Animal Health business grew 3%, 6% FX change to $687 million, reflecting growth in North and South America, as well as growth and poultry, swine and aquaculture. Consumer Care sales also increased 3% to $291 million due to the growth of foot care, respiratory and skin care products. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the impact of generic MiraLAX.
 Now moving on to the P&L. You can see that we have done a very good job controlling our expenses again this quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making against our merger synergies, and we are doing so while launching new products and making great progress with the R&D pipeline. As you know, the costs of our combined company are represented in our current cost base. Whereas only the legacy Merck costs were included in the third quarter of 2009, which complicates analysis on a year-over-year basis. As a result, I will speak to the sequential trends on the cost line since those comparisons are more meaningful.
 First, materials and production. The non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 74.9%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2010 when the gross margin was 76.5%. As you can see, our gross margin moves a bit quarter-to-quarter mostly due to product mix. This quarter, the mix changes came from a variety of factors, including lower sequential sales of products like NASONEX, CLARINEX and CLARITIN. Sequentially, the second quarter also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact, which did not recur in the third quarter.
 Moving on to marketing and admin [administrative] expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $3 billion, which was about $100 million lower than the second quarter of 2010. And on a year-to-year basis, we drove significant cost savings in M&A due to the realization of merger synergies. This was partially tempered by increased promotional spending to support new launches like SIMPONI and DULERA. As you know, we are actively launching many new products, and we expect 2011 to be an exciting year for new product launches in the U.S. and around the world. I'll talk more about that later.
 Research and development expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.9 billion, which was slightly lower than the first two quarters due to the continued work we are doing to further prioritize our R&D investments. As a result of the prioritization activities, we decided to stop investment in a few additional programs in the third quarter. We also previously announced the plan to rationalize our R&D network. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in our most promising, late-stage projects such as vorapaxar, boceprevir, telcagepant, odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE. And these key programs in our pipeline continue to move forward.
 Now let's move to equity income. In the third quarter, Merck recorded $236 million of equity income. As expected, this was sequentially higher than second quarter. Remember the income from the AZLP [AstraZeneca LP] joint venture in the second quarter was low due to the inherent variability in the timing of income from the AZLP joint venture.
 Moving on to other expense. On a non-GAAP basis, other expense of $158 million was comparable to the second quarter of 2010. Our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a legal reserve of $950 million in connection with an anticipated resolution of a previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for District of Massachusetts related to VIOXX.
 Moving to tax. The Merck non-GAAP tax rate was 22.2% for the third quarter, which was higher than the rate that we saw in the second quarter. As noted in the press release, we continue to expect full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition to the solid operational performance this quarter, we also returned the cash to shareholders through our dividend and by making continued progress on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and spent approximately $300 million to repurchase roughly 8 million shares of our common stock. So far this year, we have repurchased about 47 million shares for $1.6 billion.
 So in summary, we continue on a strong trajectory since our merger. Now let's spend our remaining time reviewing our outlook for 2010 and beyond, and let's start with our 2010 outlook. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we are only making one change to our 2010 financial targets. We raised the lower end of our EPS target range, resulting in an increase in the midpoint of our EPS range. On a non-GAAP basis, Merck is now targeting a full year 2010 EPS range of $3.31 to $3.39, excluding certain items. Please see our press release for the GAAP guidance.
 Factored into this EPS range are the top line pressures in the U.S. and the EU, including the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S., which is unchanged from our previous estimates and the impact of European austerity measures. Recall that we had anticipated a mid-single digit unfavorable impact on European sales in the second half of 2010. We still believe that will be the case.
 Our current year EPS range also assumes that Merck retains full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in our markets. On the expense side, as I mentioned earlier, we also anticipate increased promotional spending in the fourth quarter and in 2011 for new product launches like DULERA, DAXAS, BRINAVESS and additional launches of SIMPONI around the world, not to mention we are preparing for the prospect of launching boceprevir in 2011. And we continue to make new targeted commercial and R&D investments including those in the emerging markets.
 These growth driving investments are a major reason why we expect our operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than they were in the third quarter of 2010. So while these top line pressures and operating investments put pressure on the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with our full year 2010 EPS guidance range.
 Finally, let me touch on our long-term outlook. We remain excited about our future, and we have many opportunities between our commercial launches, our R&D pipeline and the merger restructuring activities are already well underway. We continue to target a high single digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 regardless of the outcome of the REMICADE arbitration.
 In addition, we are well on track to realize our $3.5 billion synergy target by the end of 2012. So in closing, we're pleased with the solid third quarter results we reported today. Operational growth in our business, our launch of new products and tight expense management each contributed to our results. We have had a strong performance during our first year of the combined operations, demonstrating that the merger is working, and we are right on track. Thank you.
 Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex. Alex?

In terms of the SG&A performance, I think your question was are we achieving the first year synergies that we anticipated? I would say, in fact, that's probably one of the areas that we're very proud of so far. The commercial team, speaking for them, if I can, had done a great job actually in beginning of this year rapidly integrating the organizations and finding the right synergies, leveraging the new commercial model around the world. I believe we've commented in the past that at this point, we've got, Ken, I'll turn it over to you, but about 17 of our top 20 markets around the world. Ken, do you want to add any other comments?

And as I mentioned also that in this quarter, we had about $300 million of share repurchase but on a year-to-date basis, that's $1.3 billion. So I think from the free cash flow of the company, you can see that we're doing good job redeploying cash even this year in the first year of the merger. So that is important to us. That said though, we are very actively looking to make great value creating deals around the world, and I think our business development activity is very active in a number of areas. One is to make sure that we have the best pipeline in the industry. Secondly, looking for great combinations and opportunities to partner around the world on the commercial side. And thirdly, in the emerging markets space, we recognize that we're going to be broadening our footprint and we want to make sure that we work with good partners locally to help create that value. So the BD [ph] size is also active and that does come into play. The last thing I would say is relative to our debt, obviously, what we talked about at the time of the merger was we design the merger to make sure that we landed in about the same place that we were before the merger. And we targeted the credit ratings to allow us to have some flexibility, but to also reinforce the strength of Merck, so that we can handle any kind of issues that come up. But also, more importantly, that we can invest on the strategic opportunities that we have around the world and we intend to continue that. It is true, we are generating solid cash flow and we'll be -- that cash flow performance will be growing. And so we will keep an eye on that. We will be shareholder friendly. But obviously, we will also intend to maintain our credit rating. We work closely with the credit agencies to make sure we're in the right place, and I think we're in about the right place right now.

Obviously, from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, that is an operation that does have inherent variability in the timing of payments and recognition of income, obviously. However, it's a business that continues to do nicely. We haven't really given guidance for these individual businesses and so forth, but there are timing of different seasonality of the products and so forth. On the -- related to that relationship, there is, as you know, in February, there was an option on the non-PPI products that was executed. And you saw a gain in our financials earlier this year from that and obviously, that gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results, it's included in our GAAP results and then some of our tables. The next option timing is two years later. That's for the PPI items, so that'll be roughly in the first part of 2012. And at this point, where we've always assumed that they will exercise that option that said it's their choice and we can't really predict exactly what will happen, but that's the way we thought about it anyway. And then moving to the product gross margins for the quarter, you're right. You put your finger on the two points. One is obviously -- there is some volatility in PGM just naturally because of the mix and some of that mix is because of products or to be -- divisional and so forth, so that does move around a little bit. The other factor that we had in the second and third quarter this year when you compare it in the second and to third quarter was in the same quarter, we did get some foreign exchange benefit and the third quarter that didn't recur. So that also kind of caused the third quarter to look a little weaker versus the second quarter. And obviously the mix also, so we kind of have two factors go against us in the third quarter. I think we have experienced a higher level of volatility in foreign exchange rates this year than normal. And so to that on some timing basis eventually does roll to the cost of goods.

But on a more strategic level, Tony, and I think that's a good question. I think one of the things that Merck will have from a competitive advantage standpoint is that when you look at either governments on an international basis, whether it's a nice type organization or whether we're moving to healthcare reform today and the government's going to play a larger role or whether you're looking to some of the larger managed care payers that exist in the United States. The important part is going to be health technology assessment and the ability to have clinical outcomes and be able to approve that whatever product you're thinking about from a regulatory approval and launch standpoint is above the standard of care that exists today. And I think where our competitive advantage is a company is our late-stage pipeline and how much of it has the ability to meet unmet medical needs and it is differentiated products, and we have the clinical outcome studies to prove it.
