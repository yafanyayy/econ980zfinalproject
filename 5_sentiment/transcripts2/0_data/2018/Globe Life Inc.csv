In the fourth quarter, net income was $1,027,000,000, or $8.71 per share, compared to $135 million or $1.12 per share a year ago. The increase is due primarily to the reduction of the parity contacts liabilities, resulting from the tax legislation passed late in 2017. While we view tax form as a very beneficial with Torchmark and its shareholders in the long run, the positive impact of the new lower tax rates on current taxes paid will be largely offset by expanded tax base over the next several years. Frank will discuss this in more details in his comments. Without the impact of tax reform, net income for the fourth quarter would've been $153 million or $1.36 per share. 
Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $147 million or $1.24 per share, a per share increase of 8% from the year-ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 28.2% and book value per share was $52.95. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and the impact of tax reform, return on equity was 14.4%, and book value per share was $34.68, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 6% to $581 million, and life underwriting margin was $160 million, up 12% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due primarily to favorable results in direct response and, to a lesser extent, American income. In 2018, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $246 million, while health underwriting margin was up 4% to $55 million. In 2018, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%. 
Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 9% from the year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $211 million or 6.4% of premium. In 2018, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to remain around 6.5% of premium.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $258 million, and life underwriting margin was up 14% to $86 million. Net life sales were $56 million, up 7% due primarily to higher agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,959, up 1% from a year ago, and down 3% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,880. Life sales for the full year 2017 grew 6%. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $6 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count and worksite activity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,112, up 19% from a year ago, and down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. 
Life net sales for the full year 2017 grew 17%. Health net sales for the full year 2017 grew 5%. 
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 4% to $199 million. Net life sales were down 15% to $29 million. For the full year of 2017, life sales declined 10%. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is intentional. We've made operational changes designed to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We are pleased with the increase in profit margins. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $65 million, and health underwriting margin increased 9% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 12% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,026, up 8% from a year ago, and approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,076. Health sales for the full year 2017 grew 10%. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $92 million. Net health sales were $28 million, up 17% compared to the year-ago quarter, reaching increases in both the group and individual manager supplement units. 
To complete my discussion for the market operations, I will now provide some forward-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,000 to 7,400; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,125 to 1,185. 
Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 11% to 15% growth; Direct Response, 1% to 9% decline. 
Health net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 1% to 5% growth; Family Heritage, 3% to 7% growth; United American Individual Medicare supplement, 4% to 8% growth.

First, excess investment income.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we defined as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrease over the year-ago quarter. The decrease is due in part to the negative carry from the earlier refinancing of the debt issue. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. In 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow around 3%. However, on a per share basis, we expect the increase to be around 6% to 7%. 
In our investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.8 billion, including $15 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Out of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion, our investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $702 million compared to $751 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.7%, compared to 5.3% a year ago. And with the portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 15%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as in the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $2 billion, approximately $916 million higher than a year ago. 
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $262 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.36%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.61%, down 14 basis points from the 5.75% yield in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.60%. 
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.75% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospects of higher long-term interest rates. Higher money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest-rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require for us to write-off the AC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would definitely benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial investment income and that extended low interest rate environment. 
Now, I'll turn the call to Frank."

In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.1 million shares at an average price of $78.67. So far in 2018, we have spent $26.8 million to purchase 292,000 shares. These purchases are being made from the parents companies excess cash flow. The parent at the end of the year as liquid assets are $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2017 statutory earnings had not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $378 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of the year in 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Next, a few comments on the new tax legislation. As you know, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, and makes other changes affecting the Tax Law. Overall, the legislation will provide a significant long-term benefits to Torchmark, since the future profits of the business will be taxed at a lower rate, benefiting our long-term shareholders. The tax rate reduction required the company to make a onetime adjustment to reduce the deferred income tax liability carried on the GAAP financial statements. This adjustment, along with other onetime adjustments, resulted in a nonrecurring GAAP tax benefit of $874 million recorded in the fourth quarter, approximately $275 million of which related to unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments. The entire $874 million adjustment was treated as a nonoperating item. But, as noted earlier by Gary, increased the GAAP net income per share significantly. The task adjustments also increased our book value per share in December 31, 2017, by $5.09, or approximately 15%. Looking forward, we expect our 2018 operating income effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, resulting in an expected increase in net operating income of approximately 17%. 
While the new tax rate will result in a lower GAAP tax expense, cash taxes paid will not show a similar reduction in the near- or intermediate-term. On a cash tax basis, the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by provisions of the new deal legislation that limit the tax deduction for policy reserves and acquisition costs. As such, we do not expect a significant increase in statutory earnings from the lower tax rates. In addition, the lower tax rate will have a negative impact on our insurance company statutory capital by reducing their deferred tax assets. Although we have not completed the statutory filings for insurance subsidiaries, we expect the reduction in total statutory capital to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million as of December 31, 2017. Thus, in short, the GAAP tax rate will decline by 12 to 13 basis points, but in the intermediate-term, cash taxes will only be slightly lower, and we may be required to reduce capital and insurance subsidiaries over time to make up for the lower deferred tax assets. 
In the coming months, we will evaluate further the short- and long-term effects of the new tax legislation on our operations. 
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at a level necessary to return -- to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. While our 2017 statutory financial statements are not finalized, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be in the range of 300% to 310% of company-action-level RBC, reflecting roughly a 30 basis point reduction in the ratio as a result of the reduction in deferred tax assets as previously discussed. Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as is expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect the further reduction of approximately 45 basis points in our RBC ratio for the year end at December 31, 2018. We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018, in light of the tax legislation, and we'll need to have discussions with our rating agencies and regulators on the topic. Should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can find any required amounts without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the fourth quarter, we again slight growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 18.4%, up from 15.1% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher-than-normal policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to lower policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the lower policy obligations were generally expected due to seasonality, the overall underwriting margin percentage for the fourth quarter was at the high-end of our expectations. 
The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2017 was 15.6%, toward the higher end of the range provided on previous calls. For 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2017, in the 14.5% to 16.5% range. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally low in the first half of the year and then higher in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income from the continuing operations per share will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 per share midpoint of this guidance reflects a 24% increase over the 2017 earnings per share of $4.82. The increase is primarily attributable to the lower tax rate in 2018, offset by a higher after-tax compensation expense due to the lower tax benefits. We now estimate that our stock compensation expense will be in the range of $18 million to $22 million, as compared to approximately $5 million, absent tax reform.

Short-term interest rates, affecting our short-term debt, those costs will have a bit of our higher interest expense as well and, of course, for some of the higher share price, a little bit of a drag with respect to the impact of the buyback program. And then we really look at the option expense. And I think one of the items that really looked at is while the increase -- or the decrease in overall tax rates gave us about $1 of additional earnings per share from just a change in the rate, the excess tax benefits that we've had is an offset against our stock option expense. Of course, we have, with respect to the stock option expense, you have a lower tax benefit plus we have lower excess tax benefits.

In the fourth quarter, net income was $1,027,000,000, or $8.71 per share, compared to $135 million or $1.12 per share a year ago. The increase is due primarily to the reduction of the parity contacts liabilities, resulting from the tax legislation passed late in 2017. While we view tax reform as being very beneficial to Torchmark and its shareholders in the long run, the positive impact of the new lower tax rates on current taxes paid will be largely offset by the expanded tax base over the next several years. Frank will discuss this in more detail in his comments. Without the impact of tax reform, net income for the fourth quarter would've been $153 million or $1.30 per share. 
Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $147 million or $1.24 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 28.2% and book value per share was $52.95. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and the impact of tax reform, return on equity was 14.4%, and book value per share was $34.68, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 6% to $581 million, and life underwriting margin was $160 million, up 12% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due primarily to favorable results in direct response and to a lesser extent, American Income. In 2018, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $246 million, while health underwriting margin was up 4% to $55 million. In 2018, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%. 
Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $211 million or 6.4% of premium. In 2018, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to remain around 6.5% of premium.

As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is intentional. We have made operational changes designed to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We are pleased with the increase in profit margins.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrease over the year-ago quarter. The decrease is due in part to the negative carry from the earlier refinancing of a debt issue. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. In 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow around 3%. However, on a per share basis, we expect the increase to be around 6% to 7%. 
In our investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.8 billion, including $15 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade, with an with average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $702 million compared to $751 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.7%, compared to 5.3% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 15%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, approximately $916 million higher than a year ago. 
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $262 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.36%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.61%, down 14 basis points from the 5.75% yield in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.60%. 
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.75% for the full year. We were encouraged by the prospect of higher long-term interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest-rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would definitely benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 mill",1191,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.1 million shares at an average price of $78.67. So far in 2018, we have spent $26.8 million to purchase 292,000 shares. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2017 statutory earnings had not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $378 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of the year, end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Next, a few comments on the new tax legislation. As you know, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, and makes other changes affecting the Tax Law. Overall, the legislation will provide significant long-term benefits to Torchmark, since the future profits of the business will be taxed at the lower rate, benefiting our long-term shareholders. The tax rate reduction required the company to make a onetime adjustment to reduce the deferred income tax liability carried on the GAAP financial statements. This adjustment, along with other onetime adjustments, resulted in a nonrecurring GAAP tax benefit of $874 million recorded in the fourth quarter, approximately $275 million of which related to unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments. The entire $874 million adjustment was treated as a nonoperating item. But as noted earlier by Gary, increased the GAAP net income per share significantly. The task adjustment also increased our book value per share in December 31, 2017 by $5.09, or approximately 15%. Looking forward, we expect our 2018 operating income effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, resulting in an expected increase in net operating income of approximately 17%. 
While the new tax rate will result in a lower GAAP tax expense, cash taxes paid will not show a similar reduction in the near- or intermediate-term. On a cash tax basis, the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by provisions of the new legislation that limit the tax deduction for policy reserves and acquisition costs. As such, we do not expect a significant increase in statutory earnings from the lower tax rates. In addition, the lower tax rate will have a negative impact on our insurance company statutory capital by reducing their deferred tax assets. Although we have not completed the statutory filings for our insurance subsidiaries, we expect the reduction in total statutory capital to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million as of December 31, 2017. Thus, in short, the GAAP tax rate will decline by 12 to 13 basis points, but in the intermediate-term, cash taxes will only be slightly lower, and we may be required to infuse capital into our insurance subsidiaries over time, to make up for the lower deferred tax assets. 
In the coming months, we will evaluate further the short- and long-term effects of the new tax legislation on our operations. 
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to return -- to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. While our 2017 statutory financial statements are not finalized, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be in the range of 300% to 310% of company-action-level RBC, reflecting roughly a 30 basis point reduction in the ratio as a result of the reduction in deferred tax assets previously discussed. Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as is expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect a further reduction of approximately 45 basis points in our RBC ratio for the year end in December 31, 2018. We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018, in light of the tax legislation, and we'll need to have discussions with our rating agencies and regulators on the topic. Should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any required amounts without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 18.4%, up from 15.1% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher-than-normal policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to lower policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the lower policy obligations were generally expected due to seasonality, the overall underwriting margin percentage for the fourth quarter was at the high-end of our expectations. 
The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2017 was 15.6%, toward the higher end of the range provided on previous calls. For 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2017, in the 14.5% to 16.5% range. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally low in the first half of the year and then higher in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share, will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 per share midpoint of this guidance reflects a 24% increase over the 2017 earnings per share of $4.82. The increase is primarily attributable to the lower tax rate in 2018, offset by higher after-tax compensation expense due to the lower tax benefits. We now estimate that our stock compensation expense will be in the range of $18 million to $22 million, as compared to approximately $5 million, absent tax reform. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

But then that uptick, maybe offset a little bit, due to some higher administrative expenses. We're looking -- our pension expense is going to be going up a little bit again in 2018, so that will be a little bit of a headwind. Short-term interest rates, affecting our short-term debt, those costs, that will have a bit of our higher interest expense as well, and then of course, for some of the higher share price, a little bit of a drag with respect to the impact of the buyback program. And then we really look at the option expense. And I think one of the items that really looked at is, while the increase in the -- or the decrease in overall tax rates gave us about $1 of additional earnings per share, from just a change in the rate, the excess tax benefits that we've had, that's an offset against our stock option expense.

While we view tax reform as being very beneficial to Torchmark and its shareholders in the long run, the positive impact of the new lower tax rates on current taxes paid will be largely offset by the expanded tax base over the next several years. Frank will discuss this in more detail in his comments. Without the impact of tax reform, net income for the fourth quarter would've been $153 million or $1.30 per share. 
Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $147 million or $1.24 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 28.2% and book value per share was $52.95. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and the impact of tax reform, return on equity was 14.4%, and book value per share was $34.68, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 6% to $581 million, and life underwriting margin was $160 million, up 12% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due primarily to favorable results in direct response and to a lesser extent, American Income. In 2018, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $246 million, while health underwriting margin was up 4% to $55 million. In 2018, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%. 
Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $211 million or 6.4% of premium. In 2018, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to remain around 6.5% of premium. 
I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations."

Net life sales were $56 million, up 7% due primarily to higher agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,959, up 1% from a year ago, and down 3% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,880. Life sales for the full year 2017 grew 6%. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $6 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count and worksite activity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,112, up 19% from a year ago, but down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. 
Life net sales for the full year 2017 grew 17%. Health net sales for the full year 2017 grew 5%. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $199 million. Net life sales were down 15% to $29 million. For the full year of 2017, life sales declined 10%. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is intentional. We have made operational changes designed to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We are pleased with the increase in profit margins. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $65 million, and health underwriting margin increased 9% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 12% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,026, up 8% from a year ago, and approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,076. Health sales for the full year 2017 grew 10%. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $92 million. Net health sales were $28 million, up 17% compared to the year-ago quarter, due to increases in both the group and individual Medicare supplement units. 
To complete my discussion for the market operations, I will now provide some forward-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,000 to 7,400; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,125 to 1,185. 
Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 11% to 15% growth; Direct Response, 1% to 9% decline.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrea",502,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrease over the year-ago quarter. The decrease is due in part to the negative carry from the earlier refinancing of a debt issue. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. In 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow around 3%. However, on a per share basis, we expect the increase to be around 6% to 7%. 
In our investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.8 billion, including $15 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade, with an with average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $702 million compared to $751 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.7%, compared to 5.3% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 15%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, approximately $916 million higher than a year ago. 
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $262 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.36%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.61%, down 14 basis points from the 5.75% yield in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.60%. 
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.75% for the full year. We were encouraged by the prospect of higher long-term interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest-rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more important, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would definitely benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now, I will turn the call over to Frank."

For the full year 2017, we spent $325 mill",1192,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.1 million shares at an average price of $78.67. So far in 2018, we have spent $26.8 million to purchase 292,000 shares. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2017 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of the year, end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Next, a few comments on the new tax legislation. As you know, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, and makes other changes affecting the Tax Law. Overall, the legislation will provide significant long-term benefits to Torchmark, since future profits of the business will be taxed at the lower rate, benefiting our long-term shareholders. The tax rate reduction required the company to make a onetime adjustment to reduce the deferred income tax liability carried on the GAAP financial statements. This adjustment, along with other onetime adjustments, resulted in a nonrecurring GAAP tax benefit of $874 million recorded in the fourth quarter, approximately $275 million of which related to unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments. The entire $874 million adjustment was treated as a nonoperating item. But as noted earlier by Gary, increased the GAAP net income per share significantly. The task adjustment also increased our book value per share in December 31, 2017, by $5.09, or approximately 15%. Looking forward, we expect our 2018 operating income effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, resulting in an expected increase in net operating income of approximately 17%. 
While the new tax rate will result in a lower GAAP tax expense, cash taxes paid will not show a similar reduction in the near or intermediate term. On a cash tax basis, the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by provisions of the new legislation that limit the tax deduction for policy reserves and acquisition costs. As such, we do not expect a significant increase in statutory earnings from the lower tax rate. In addition, the lower tax rate will have a negative impact on our insurance company statutory capital by reducing their deferred tax assets. Although we have not completed the statutory filings for our insurance subsidiaries, we expect the reduction in total statutory capital to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million as of December 31, 2017. Thus, in short, the GAAP tax rate will decline by 12 to 13 basis points, but in the intermediate term, cash taxes will only be slightly lower, and we may be required to infuse capital into our insurance subsidiaries over time, to make up for the lower deferred tax assets. 
In the coming months, we will evaluate further the short- and long-term effects of the new tax legislation on our operations. 
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to return -- to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. While our 2017 statutory financial statements are not finalized, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be in the range of 300% to 310% of company-action-level RBC, reflecting roughly a 30 basis point reduction in the ratio as a result of the reduction in deferred tax assets previously discussed. Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as is expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect a further reduction of approximately 45 basis points in our RBC ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018. We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018, in light of the tax legislation, and we'll need to have discussions with our rating agencies and regulators on the topic. Should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any required amounts without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 18.4%, up from 15.1% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher-than-normal policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to lower policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the lower policy obligations were generally expected due to seasonality, the overall underwriting margin percentage for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our expectations. 
The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2017 was 15.6%, toward the higher end of the range provided on previous calls. For 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2017, in the 14.5% to 16.5% range. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally low in the first half of the year and then higher in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share, will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 per share midpoint of this guidance reflects a 24% increase over the 2017 earnings per share of $4.82. The increase is primarily attributable to the lower tax rate in 2018, offset by higher after-tax compensation expense due to the lower tax benefits. We now estimate that our stock compensation expense will be in the range of $18 million to $22 million, as compared to approximately $5 million, absent tax reform.

That was actually a little bit of an improvement from what we had anticipated back in October. So the experience that we saw in the fourth quarter kind of helped us with that. But then that uptick, maybe offset a little bit, due to some higher administrative expenses. We're looking -- our pension expense is going to be going up a little bit again in 2018, so that will be a little bit of a headwind. Short-term interest rates, affecting our short-term debt, those costs, that will have a bit of higher interest expense as well, and then of course, for some of the higher share price, a little bit of a drag with respect to the impact of the buyback program. And then we really look at the option expense. And I think one of the items that really looked at is, while the increase in the -- or the decrease in overall tax rate gave us about $1 of additional earnings per share, from just a change in the rate, the excess tax benefits that we've had, that's an offset against our stock option expense. Of course, we have, with respect to the stock option expense, you have a lower tax benefit, plus we have lower excess tax benefits.

In the fourth quarter, net income was $1,027,000,000, or $8.71 per share, compared to $135 million or $1.12 per share a year ago. The increase is due primarily to the reduction of deferred income tax liabilities, resulting from the tax legislation passed late in 2017. While we view tax reform as being very beneficial to Torchmark and its shareholders in the long run, the positive impact of the new lower tax rates on current taxes paid will be largely offset by the expanded tax base over the next several years. Frank will discuss this in more detail in his comments. Without the impact of tax reform, net income for the fourth quarter would've been $153 million or $1.30 per share. 
Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $147 million or $1.24 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 28.2% and book value per share was $52.95. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and the impact of tax reform, return on equity was 14.4%, and book value per share was $34.68, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 6% to $581 million, and life underwriting margin was $160 million, up 12% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due primarily to favorable results in direct response and to a lesser extent, American Income. In 2018, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $246 million, while health underwriting margin was up 4% to $55 million. In 2018, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%. 
Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $211 million or 6.4% of premium. In 2018, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to remain around 6.5% of premium.

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $6 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count and worksite activity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,112, up 19% from a year ago, but down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. 
Life net sales for the full year 2017 grew 17%. Health net sales for the full year 2017 grew 5%. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $199 million. Net life sales were down 15% to $29 million. For the full year of 2017, life sales declined 10%. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is intentional. We have made operational changes designed to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We are pleased with the increase in profit margins. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $65 million, and health underwriting margin increased 9% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 12% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,026, up 8% from a year ago, and approximately the same as the third quarter.

At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $92 million. Net health sales were $28 million, up 17% compared to the year-ago quarter, due to increases in both the group and individual Medicare supplement units.

We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,000 to 7,400; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,125 to 1,185. 
Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 11% to 15% growth; Direct Response, 1% to 9% decline.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrease over the year-ago quarter. The decrease is due in part to the negative carry from the earlier refinancing of a debt issue. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. In 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow around 3%. However, on a per share basis, we expect the increase to be around 6% to 7%. 
In our investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.8 billion, including $15 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade, with an with average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $702 million compared to $751 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.7%, compared to 5.3% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 15%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, approximately $916 million higher than a year ago. 
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $262 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.36%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.61%, down 14 basis points from the 5.75% yield in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.60%. 
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.75% for the full year. We were encouraged by the prospect of higher long-term interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest-rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more important, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would definitely benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now, I will turn the call over to Frank."

For the full year 2017, we spent $325 mill",1192,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.1 million shares at an average price of $78.67. So far in 2018, we have spent $26.8 million to purchase 292,000 shares. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2017 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of the year, end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Next, a few comments on the new tax legislation. As you know, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, and makes other changes affecting the Tax Law. Overall, the legislation will provide significant long-term benefits to Torchmark, since future profits of the business will be taxed at the lower rate, benefiting our long-term shareholders. The tax rate reduction required the company to make a onetime adjustment to reduce the deferred income tax liability carried on the GAAP financial statements. This adjustment, along with other onetime adjustments, resulted in a nonrecurring GAAP tax benefit of $874 million recorded in the fourth quarter, approximately $275 million of which related to unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments. The entire $874 million adjustment was treated as a nonoperating item. But as noted earlier by Gary, increased the GAAP net income per share significantly. The task adjustment also increased our book value per share in December 31, 2017, by $5.09, or approximately 15%. Looking forward, we expect our 2018 operating income effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, resulting in an expected increase in net operating income of approximately 17%. 
While the new tax rate will result in a lower GAAP tax expense, cash taxes paid will not show a similar reduction in the near or intermediate term. On a cash tax basis, the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by provisions of the new legislation that limit the tax deduction for policy reserves and acquisition costs. As such, we do not expect a significant increase in statutory earnings from the lower tax rate. In addition, the lower tax rate will have a negative impact on our insurance company statutory capital by reducing their deferred tax assets. Although we have not completed the statutory filings for our insurance subsidiaries, we expect the reduction in total statutory capital to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million as of December 31, 2017. Thus, in short, the GAAP tax rate will decline by 12 to 13 basis points, but in the intermediate term, cash taxes will only be slightly lower, and we may be required to infuse capital into our insurance subsidiaries over time, to make up for the lower deferred tax assets. 
In the coming months, we will evaluate further the short- and long-term effects of the new tax legislation on our operations. 
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to return -- to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. While our 2017 statutory financial statements are not finalized, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be in the range of 300% to 310% of company-action-level RBC, reflecting roughly a 30 basis point reduction in the ratio as a result of the reduction in deferred tax assets previously discussed. Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as is expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect a further reduction of approximately 45 basis points in our RBC ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018. We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018, in light of the tax legislation, and we'll need to have discussions with our rating agencies and regulators on the topic. Should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any required amounts without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 18.4%, up from 15.1% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher-than-normal policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to lower policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the lower policy obligations were generally expected due to seasonality, the overall underwriting margin percentage for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our expectations. 
The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2017 was 15.6%, toward the higher end of the range provided on previous calls. For 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2017, in the 14.5% to 16.5% range. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally low in the first half of the year and then higher in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share, will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 per share midpoint of this guidance reflects a 24% increase over the 2017 earnings per share of $4.82. The increase is primarily attributable to the lower tax rate in 2018, offset by higher after-tax compensation expense due to the lower tax benefits.

We're looking -- our pension expense is going to be going up a little bit again in 2018, so that will be a little bit of a headwind. Short-term interest rates, affecting our short-term debt, those costs, that will have a bit of higher interest expense as well, and then of course, for some of the higher share price, a little bit of a drag with respect to the impact of the buyback program. And then we really look at the option expense. And I think one of the items that really looked at is, while the increase in the -- or the decrease in overall tax rate gave us about $1 of additional earnings per share, from just a change in the rate, the excess tax benefits that we've had, that's an offset against our stock option expense.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $252 million end health underwriting margin was up 9% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins and Family Heritage and American Income.

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was down 12% to $16 million. Net life sales was an increase 4% to $100 million and net health sales were $5 million, up 11% from the year ago quarter. 
The sales increase is driven primarily by growth and agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,087, up 15% from a year ago, but down 1% compared to the fourth quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,224. 
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 14% to $34 million. Net life sales were down 17% to $32 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. If you need to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitably of new seals. 
At Family Heritage, health premium increased 8% to $66 million and health underwriting margin increased 41% to $16 million. Health net sales were up 1% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 988, up 11% from a year ago, but down 14% from the fourth quarter. 
The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,026.
In United American General Agency, health premiums increased 2% to $94 million. Net health sales were $14 million, up 24% compared to the year ago quarter due to increases in both the group and individual Medicare settlement units. 
To complete my discussion of marketing operations, I will now provide some forward-looking information.
Approximate life and sales transfer to full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 5% to 9% growth; liberty National, 9% to 13% growth; direct Response, 6% to 10% decline. Approximate health trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 2% to 6% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; and United American Individual Medicare settlement, 5% to 9% growth. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,555905919,1432251,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, our excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income lines, acquired interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 4% i",438,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, our excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income lines, acquired interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 4% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 8%. 
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 3%. However, on a per share basis, which should see an increase of about 6%. 
And so our investment portfolio, invested assets are $16 million, including $15.3 million of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the 6 maturities, $14.6 million are investment-grade with an average rating of 8 minus and below investment-grade bonds were $688 million compared to $711 million a year ago. In the percentage of low investment grade bonds, fixed maturities was 4.5% compared to 4.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains or fixed maturities is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, the same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion, approximately $90 million higher than the year ago. 
Regarding investment yields. In the first quarter, we invested $359 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial and tax immunities. We invested in average yield of 4.46%, an average rating at an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.58%, down 12 basis points from the 5.7% yield in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.57%. 
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.75% for the full year. We would like to see higher interest rates going forward, higher new rates would have a positive impact on operating income by driving excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we were not expected to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. 
However, as rates all rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the GAAP for statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest protection products accounted for under FAS 60. 
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue in substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Frank."
308916,555905919,1432251,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The",854,"Thanks, Gary. First I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. Please cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. 
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $375 million to $385 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
In the first quarter, we spent $87 million to buy $1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.32. So far in April, we have spent $18 million to purchase 220,000 shares. Thus, for the full year through today, we spent $105 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.2 million shares at an average price of $85.40. These purchases were made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of fund. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital level at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital levels necessary to support our current rate. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2017, our consolidated RBC ratio was 314%, a decrease from the prior year due to the reduction in deferred tax assets that resulted from the passage of the tax reform legislation at the end of last year. Even though lower than the 325% target, this capital level is 6.3x the amount of capital required by our regulators.
We are still on the early stages of determining the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018. We will have discussions with our rating agency and insurance regulators in the coming months. It remains unclear what changes the NAIC will make to the existing required capital factors or if such changes will be effective from 2018 or delayed until 2019. Thus, we are unsure at this time how our targeted capital levels will be impacted.
In any instance, should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any amount without a significant impact on our excess cash flow.
Next, a few comments on our underwriting results. In the first quarter, we saw a decrease in the life underwriting margin percentage of Liberty National. The underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 24%, down from 27% in the year ago quarter. This reflects higher policy obligations in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2017, which were lower than expected. While higher obligations in the first quarter of the year are generally expected, the claims in the first quarter this year were higher than we've experienced in the past couple of years and higher than anticipated.
At this time, we believe the higher claims with the fluctuations and that for the full year 2018, the underwriting margin percentage will be in the range of 24% to 26% of premium. 
With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 16% as compared to 14% in the year ago quarter. This is primarily attributable to favorable claims in the first quarter of this year as compared to higher-than-normal claims in the first quarter of 2017. While the underwriting margin percentage was in line with our previous guidance, it was higher than we anticipated for the quarter. 
For the last 4 quarters, the underwriting margin has averaged 16% of premium. For the full year 2018, we are now estimating the underwriting margin for a Direct Response to be in the range of 15% to 17%, up slightly from our prior guidance.
Finally, stock compensation expense net of tax increased substantially from the year ago quarter. As noted on our last call, this is primarily attributable to lower tax benefits resulting from the new tax law. The net expense in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We anticipate the net expense for 2018 to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million.
Now with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $5.93 to $6.07 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance. Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $598 million, and life underwriting margin was $155 million, up 7% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. 
For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $252 million and health underwriting margin was up 9% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income.

The sales increase is driven primarily by growth and agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,087, up 15% from a year ago, but down 1% compared to the fourth quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,224.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 14% to $34 million. Net life sales were down 17% to $32 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design we do to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitably of new sales.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $66 million, and health underwriting margin increased 41% to $16 million. Health net sales were up 1% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 988, up 11% from a year ago, but down 14% from the fourth quarter.

First, our excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 4% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 8%.
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 3%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 6%.
And so our investment portfolio, invested assets are $16 billion, including $15.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the 6 maturities, $14.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $711 million a year ago. In the percentage of low investment grade bonds, the fixed maturity is 4.5% compared to 4.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains with fixed maturities, is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, the same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion, approximately $90 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yields. In the first quarter, we invested $359 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrials and tax immunities. We invested in an average yield of 4.46%, an average rating of A, and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.58%, down 12 basis points from the 5.7% yield in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.57%.
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.75% for the full year. We would like to see higher interest rates going forward, higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expected to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.
However, if rates all rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the GAAP for statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-assisted rate protection products accounted for or under FAS 60.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call back to Frank."
308916,555905919,1432453,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. T",857,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. Please expect the cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million.
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $375 million to $385 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
In the first quarter, we spent $87 million to buy $1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.32. So far in April, we have spent $18 million to purchase 220,000 shares. Thus, for the full year through today, we spent $105 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.2 million shares at an average price of $85.40. These purchases were made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the fund. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital level at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital levels necessary to support our current rate. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2017, our consolidated RBC ratio was 314%, a decrease from the prior year due to the reduction in deferred tax assets that resulted from the passage of the tax reform legislation at the end of last year. Even though lower than the 325% target, this capital level is 6.3x the amount of capital required by our regulators.
We are still on the early stages of determining the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018. We will have discussions with our rating agency and insurance regulators in the coming months. It remains unclear what changes the NAIC will make to the existing required capital factors or if such changes will be effective from 2018 or delayed until 2019. Thus, we are unsure at this time how our targeted capital levels will be impacted.
In any instance, should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any amount without a significant impact on our excess cash flow.
Next, a few comments on our underwriting results. In the first quarter, we saw a decrease in the life underwriting margin percentage of Liberty National. The underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 24%, down from 27% in the year ago quarter. This reflects higher policy obligations in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2017, which were lower than expected. While higher obligations in the first quarter of the year are generally expected, the claims in the first quarter this year were higher than we've experienced in the past couple of years and higher than anticipated.
At this time, we believe the higher claims was a fluctuation and that for the full year 2018, the underwriting margin percentage will be in the range of 24% to 26% of premium.
With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 16% as compared to 14% in the year ago quarter. This is primarily attributable to favorable claims in the first quarter of this year as compared to higher-than-normal claims in the first quarter of 2017. While the underwriting margin percentage was in line with our previous guidance, it was higher than we anticipated for the quarter.
For the last 4 quarters, the underwriting margin has averaged 16% of premium. For the full year 2018, we are now estimating the underwriting margin for Direct Response to be in the range of 15% to 17%, up slightly from our prior guidance.
Finally, stock compensation expense net of tax increased substantially from the year ago quarter. As noted on our last call, this is primarily attributable to lower tax benefits resulting from the new tax law. The net expense in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We anticipate the net expense for 2018 to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million.
Now with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $5.93 to $6.07 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

Without the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 9%.
On a GAAP-reported basis, return on equity as of March 31 was 11.5% and book value per share was $50.13. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 25% from a year ago to $40.94.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $598 million, and life underwriting margin was $155 million, up 7% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $252 million and health underwriting margin was up 9% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
Administrative expenses were $55 million, up 7% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.3% a year ago. For the year, we expect administrative expenses to be around 6.4% of premium.

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was down 12% to $16 million. Net life sales have increased 4% to $11 million, and net health sales were $5 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.
The sales increase is driven primarily by growth and agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,087, up 15% from a year ago but down 1% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,224.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 14% to $34 million. Net life sales were down 17% to $32 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitably of new sales.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $66 million, and health underwriting margin increased 41% to $16 million. Health net sales grew 1% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 988, up 11% from a year ago but down 14% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,026.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 2% to $94 million. Net health sales were $14 million, up 24% compared to the year-ago quarter due to increases at both the group and individual Medicare settlement units.

First, our excess investment income.

First, our excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 8%.
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 3%. However, on a per-share basis, we should see an increase of about 6%. 
And so our investment portfolio, invested assets are $16 billion, including $15.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the 6 maturities, $14.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $711 million a year ago. In the percentage of low investment grade bonds, the fixed maturity is 4.5% compared to 4.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains or fixed maturities, is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, the same as the year-ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion, approximately $90 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yields. In the first quarter, we invested $359 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in industrials and tax immunities. We invested in an average yield of 4.46%, an average rating of A, and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.58%, down 12 basis points from the 5.7% yield in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.57%.
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.75% for the full year. We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.
However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call back to Frank."
308916,555905919,1432653,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. T",851,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. [indiscernible] cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million.
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $375 million to $385 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
In the first quarter, we spent $87 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.32. So far in April, we have spent $18 million to purchase 220,000 shares. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $105 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.2 million shares at an average price of $85.40. These purchases were made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rate. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2017, our consolidated RBC ratio was 314%, a decrease from the prior year due to the reduction in deferred tax assets that resulted from the passage of the tax reform legislation at the end of last year. Even though lower than the 325% target, this capital level is 6.3x the amount of capital required by our regulators.
We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018. We will have discussions with our rating agency and insurance regulators in the coming months. It remains unclear what changes the NAIC will make to the existing required capital factors or if such changes will be effective from 2018 or delayed until 2019. Thus, we are unsure at this time how our targeted capital levels will be impacted. In any instance, should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any amount without a significant impact on our excess cash flow.
Next, a few comments on our underwriting result. In the first quarter, we saw a decrease in the life underwriting margin percentage at Liberty National. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 24%, down from 27% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher policy obligations in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to those in the first quarter of 2017, which were lower than expected. While higher obligations in the first quarter of the year are generally expected, the claims in the first quarter this year were higher than we've experienced in the past couple of years and higher than anticipated. At this time, we believe the higher claims was a fluctuation and that, for the full year 2018, the underwriting margin percentage will be in the range of 24% to 26% of premium.
With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 16% as compared to 14% in the year-ago quarter. This is primarily attributable to favorable claims in the first quarter of this year as compared to higher-than-normal claims in the first quarter of 2017. While the underwriting margin percentage was in line with our previous guidance, it was higher than we anticipated for the quarter.
For the last 4 quarters, the underwriting margin has averaged 16% of premium. For the full year 2018, we're now estimating the underwriting margin for Direct Response to be in the range of 15% to 17%, up slightly from our prior guidance.
Finally, stock compensation expense net of tax increased substantially from the year-ago quarter. As noted on our last call, this is primarily attributable to lower tax benefits resulting from the new tax law. The net expense in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We anticipate the net expense for 2018 to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million.
Now with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we're projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $5.93 to $6.07 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

For the last 5 years, we've had policy obligations percentage that's in the 39% range we had this quarter. The real difference was last year. It was low. It was at 37%. We expected a higher first quarter for it to lower as the year goes on, and we expect to be at the 37% ratio for the year. So it wasn't that much of a surprise, but it was a little bit higher than what we expected. Again, we expect it to level out the rest of the year, and it will -- the policy obligation ratio for the full year will be around 37%, which is what it has been the last few years."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $598 million, and life underwriting margin was $155 million, up 7% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $252 million and health underwriting margin was up 9% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.

The sales increase is driven primarily by growth and agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,087, up 15% from a year ago but down 1% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,224.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 14% to $34 million. Net life sales were down 17% to $32 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitably of new sales.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $66 million, and health underwriting margin increased 41% to $16 million. Health net sales grew 1% to $13 million.

First, our excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 8%.
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 3%. However, on a per-share basis, we should see an increase of about 6%. 
And so our investment portfolio, invested assets are $16 billion, including $15.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the 6 maturities, $14.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $711 million a year ago. In the percentage of low investment grade bonds, the fixed maturity is 4.5% compared to 4.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains or fixed maturities, is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, the same as the year-ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion, approximately $90 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yields. In the first quarter, we invested $359 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in industrials and tax immunities. We invested in an average yield of 4.46%, an average rating of A, and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.58%, down 12 basis points from the 5.7% yield in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.57%.
For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.75% for the full year. We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.
However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call back to Frank."
308916,555905919,1432950,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. T",851,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. [indiscernible] cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million.
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $375 million to $385 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
In the first quarter, we spent $87 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.32. So far in April, we have spent $18 million to purchase 220,000 shares. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $105 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.2 million shares at an average price of $85.40. These purchases were made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rate. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2017, our consolidated RBC ratio was 314%, a decrease from the prior year due to the reduction in deferred tax assets that resulted from the passage of the tax reform legislation at the end of last year. Even though lower than the 325% target, this capital level is 6.3x the amount of capital required by our regulators.
We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018. We will have discussions with our rating agency and insurance regulators in the coming months. It remains unclear what changes the NAIC will make to the existing required capital factors or if such changes will be effective from 2018 or delayed until 2019. Thus, we are unsure at this time how our targeted capital levels will be impacted. In any instance, should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any amount without a significant impact on our excess cash flow.
Next, a few comments on our underwriting result. In the first quarter, we saw a decrease in the life underwriting margin percentage at Liberty National. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 24%, down from 27% in the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher policy obligations in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to those in the first quarter of 2017, which were lower than expected. While higher obligations in the first quarter of the year are generally expected, the claims in the first quarter this year were higher than we've experienced in the past couple of years and higher than anticipated. At this time, we believe the higher claims was a fluctuation and that, for the full year 2018, the underwriting margin percentage will be in the range of 24% to 26% of premium.
With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 16% as compared to 14% in the year-ago quarter. This is primarily attributable to favorable claims in the first quarter of this year as compared to higher-than-normal claims in the first quarter of 2017. While the underwriting margin percentage was in line with our previous guidance, it was higher than we anticipated for the quarter.
For the last 4 quarters, the underwriting margin has averaged 16% of premium. For the full year 2018, we're now estimating the underwriting margin for Direct Response to be in the range of 15% to 17%, up slightly from our prior guidance.
Finally, stock compensation expense net of tax increased substantially from the year-ago quarter. As noted on our last call, this is primarily attributable to lower tax benefits resulting from the new tax law. The net expense in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We anticipate the net expense for 2018 to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million.
Now with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we're projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $5.93 to $6.07 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $603 million, and life underwriting margin was $161 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 5% to 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 4% to $251 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins and Family Heritage. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 6% to 8%.

First, excess investments income. Excess investment income, which we define, as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.  Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 1% in dollars, and 4% per share. For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow by around 2%, would result in a per-share increase of 4% to 5%.
Now regarding the portfolio. Invested assets are $16.1 billion, including $15.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14.7 billion are investment-grade, with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $688 million compared to $672 million a year ago. The percentage of the low investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.5%, compared to 4.6% a year ago. 
With the low portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding the unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, the same as the year-ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains of fixed maturity portfolio of $935 million, approximately $732 million lower than the year ago due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
In the second quarter, we invested $182 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.16%, and average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 18 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.57%, but down 11 basis points from the 5.68% yield in the second quarter of 2017. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 5% for the remainder of the year. We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we have would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.
However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets, since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for on under FAS 60.  While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $325 million, thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, of $48 million. We currently expect to have around $375 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
In the second quarter, we spent $88 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares, at an average price of $84.54. So far in July, we have spent $20 million to purchase 243,000 shares, at an average price of $83. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $195 million of parent company cash, to acquire approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $85.16. These purchases are being made for the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our recurrent rating. For the past several years, that level has been around at NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation and proposed adjustments to the NAIC RBC factors, we are having discussions with the rating agencies to determine the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries going forward. We will continue our dialogue with them over the next several months before making any final decisions.
In June, the NAIC should adjustments to certain RBC factors to reflect the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, from 35% to 21%. These new factors will be effective for 2018. Taking into account these new factors, we have roughly estimated that our company action level RBC ratio, for our year-end 2018, could be in the range of 275% to 285%. As previously noted, we have not yet finalized our target RBC ratio. However, if we were to set a target ratio of 300% to 325%, it would require approximately $100 million to $225 million of additional capital.
We understand that we may not be required to meet the appropriate target RBC ratio immediately, and that we would be allowed, could be lot to reach the target over a period of time. Given the fact that tax reform increase our GAAP equity substantially, and thus, lower our debt-to-capital ratio, we have additional borrowing capacity. But thus, we are confident that we can provide any amounts to be contributed without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. Furthermore, any additional borrowings should not adversely impact earnings, as the additional capital will be invested by the insurance companies in the long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, in the quarter was 17% compared to 15% in the year-ago quarter. This is primarily attributable to favorable claims in the second quarter of this year, compared to higher than normal winter claims in the second quarter of 2017. On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 15% to 17%.  Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response, to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17%. We are obviously pleased to see the underwriting income from Direct Response increasingly.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we saw an increase during the quarter, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We are anticipating the expense for the whole year 2018, to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.02 to $6.12 for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The $6.07 midpoint of this guidance reflects the $0.07 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6, primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response channel.

In the second quarter, net income was $184 million or $1.59 per share compared to $140 million or $1.18 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $175 million or $1.51 per share, a per share increase of 27% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of a tax reform, we estimate that this growth would have been approximately 8%.
On a GAAP-reported basis, return on equity was 12.2%, and book value per share was $48.44. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6%, and book value per share grew 26% from a year ago to $42.08.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $603 million, and life underwriting margin was $161 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 5% to 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 4% to $251 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 6% to 8%.
Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.3% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up 5% to 6% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.

The producing agent count for the second quarter was 7,064, up 1% from a year ago and up 4% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,143.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 7% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $13 million, and net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from a year ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth and agent count.
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,185, up 9% from a year ago and up 5% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,198.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% to $209 million, and life underwriting margin increased 21% to $36 million. Net life sales were down 5% to $35 million. As we've discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new sales.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $68 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $16 million. Health net sales grew 10% to $16 million.

At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $94 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 3% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,000 to 7,300; Liberty National, 2,200 to 2,400; Family Heritage, 1,160 to 1,210. Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 8% to 12% growth; Direct Response, 7% to 10% decline.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease",458,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.  Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 1% in dollars and 4% per share.
For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow by around 2%, which results in a per share increase of 4% to 5%.
Now regarding the portfolio. Invested assets are $16.1 billion, including $15.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $672 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.5% compared to 4.6% a year ago. With a low portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding the unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains on fixed maturity portfolio of $935 million, approximately $732 million lower than the year ago due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
In the second quarter, we invested $182 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.16%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 18 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.57%, down 11 basis points from the 5.68% yield in the second quarter of 2017. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new money rate of around 5% for the remainder of the year.
We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets, since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $325 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year of $48 million, we currently expect to have around $375 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
In the second quarter, we spent $88 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $84.54. So far in July, we have spent $20 million to purchase 243,000 shares at an average price of $83. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $195 million of parent company cash to acquire approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $85.16. These purchases are being made for the parent company's excess cash flow.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rating. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation and proposed adjustments to the NAIC RBC factors, we are having discussions with the rating agencies to determine the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries going forward. We will continue our dialogue with them over the next several months before making any final decisions.
In June, the NAIC issued adjustments to certain RBC factors to reflect the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These new factors will be effective for 2018. Taking into account these new factors, we have roughly estimated that our company action level RBC ratio for year-end 2018 could be in the range of 275% to 285%. As previously noted, we have not yet finalized our target RBC ratio. However, if we were to set a target ratio of 300% to 325%, it would require approximately $100 million to $225 million of additional capital.
We understand that we may not be required to meet the appropriate target RBC ratio immediately, and that we would be allowed -- could be allowed to reach the target over a period of time. Given the fact that tax reform increase our GAAP equity substantially and, thus, lower our debt-to-capital ratio, we have additional borrowing capacity. Thus, we are confident that we can find any amounts to be contributed without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. Furthermore, any additional borrowings should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital will be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 17% compared to 15% in the year ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the second quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal winter claims in the second quarter of 2017. On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 15% to 17%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17%. We are obviously pleased to see the underwriting income from Direct Response increasing here.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we saw an increase during the quarter, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We are anticipating the expense for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.02 to $6.12 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.07 midpoint of this guidance reflects the $0.07 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6 primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response channel.

  In the second quarter, net income was $184 million or $1.59 per share compared to $140 million or $1.18 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $175 million or $1.51 per share, a per share increase of 27% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of a tax reform, we estimate that this growth would have been approximately 8%.
  
  On a GAAP-reported basis, return on equity was 12.2%, and book value per share was $48.44. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6%, and book value per share grew 26% from a year ago to $42.08.
  
  In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $603 million, and life underwriting margin was $161 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 5% to 7%.
  
  On the health side, premium revenue grew 4% to $251 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 6% to 8%.
  
  Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.3% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up 5% to 6% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.

  At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $270 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $89 million. Net life sales were $60 million, up 5%.
  
  The producing agent count for the second quarter was 7,064, up 1% from a year ago and up 4% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,143.
  
  At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 7% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $13 million, and net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from a year ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth and agent count.
  
  The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,185, up 9% from a year ago and up 5% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,198.
  
  Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% to $209 million, and life underwriting margin increased 21% to $36 million. Net life sales were down 5% to $35 million. As we've discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new sales.
  
  At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $68 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $16 million. Health net sales grew 10% to $16 million.
  
  The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,052, up 2% from a year ago and up 6% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,090.
  
  At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $94 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 3% compared to the year ago quarter.
  
  To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,000 to 7,300; Liberty National, 2,200 to 2,400; Family Heritage, 1,160 to 1,210. Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 8% to 12% growth; Direct Response, 7% to 10% decline. Total net sales trends for the full year of 2018 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American individual Medicare Supplement, 10% to 20% growth.

308916,573916088,1512776,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease",458,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.  Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 1% in dollars and 4% per share.
  
  For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow by around 2%, which results in a per share increase of 4% to 5%.
  
  Now regarding the portfolio. Invested assets are $16.1 billion, including $15.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $672 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.5% compared to 4.6% a year ago. With a low portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding the unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 14%.
  
  Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains on fixed maturity portfolio of $935 million, approximately $732 million lower than the year ago due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
  
  In the second quarter, we invested $182 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.16%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 18 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.57%, down 11 basis points from the 5.68% yield in the second quarter of 2017. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%.
  
  At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new money rate of around 5% for the remainder of the year.
  
  We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets, since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60.
  
  While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
  
  Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,573916088,1512776,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $325 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year of $48 million, we currently expect to have around $375 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
  
  In the second quarter, we spent $88 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $84.54. So far in July, we have spent $20 million to purchase 243,000 shares at an average price of $83. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $195 million of parent company cash to acquire approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $85.16. These purchases are being made for the parent company's excess cash flow.
  
  As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
  
  Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rating. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation and proposed adjustments to the NAIC RBC factors, we are having discussions with the rating agencies to determine the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries going forward. We will continue our dialogue with them over the next several months before making any final decisions.
  
  In June, the NAIC issued adjustments to certain RBC factors to reflect the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These new factors will be effective for 2018. Taking into account these new factors, we have roughly estimated that our company action level RBC ratio for year-end 2018 could be in the range of 275% to 285%. As previously noted, we have not yet finalized our target RBC ratio. However, if we were to set a target ratio of 300% to 325%, it would require approximately $100 million to $225 million of additional capital.
  
  We understand that we may not be required to meet the appropriate target RBC ratio immediately, and that we would be allowed -- could be allowed to reach the target over a period of time. Given the fact that tax reform increase our GAAP equity substantially and, thus, lower our debt-to-capital ratio, we have additional borrowing capacity. Thus, we are confident that we can find any amounts to be contributed without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. Furthermore, any additional borrowings should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital will be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
  
  Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 17% compared to 15% in the year ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the second quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal winter claims in the second quarter of 2017. On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 15% to 17%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17%. We are obviously pleased to see the underwriting income from Direct Response increasing here.
  
  With respect to our stock compensation expense, we saw an increase during the quarter, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We are anticipating the expense for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million.
  
  Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.02 to $6.12 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.07 midpoint of this guidance reflects the $0.07 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6 primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response channel.

  In the second quarter, net income was $184 million or $1.59 per share compared to $140 million or $1.18 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $175 million or $1.51 per share, a per share increase of 27% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of a tax reform, we estimate that this growth would have been approximately 8%.
  
  On a GAAP-reported basis, return on equity was 12.2%, and book value per share was $48.44. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6%, and book value per share grew 26% from a year ago to $42.08.
  
  In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $603 million, and life underwriting margin was $161 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 5% to 7%.
  
  On the health side, premium revenue grew 4% to $251 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 6% to 8%.
  
  Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.3% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up 5% to 6% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.

Net life sales increased 9% to $13 million, and net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from a year ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth and agent count.

As we've discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new sales.
  
  At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $68 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $16 million. Health net sales grew 10% to $16 million.

Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 8% to 12% growth; Direct Response, 7% to 10% decline. Total net sales trends for the full year of 2018 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American individual Medicare Supplement, 10% to 20% growth.
  
  I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,573916088,1512951,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease",458,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 3% decrease over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.  Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 1% in dollars and 4% per share.
  
  For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow by around 2%, which results in a per share increase of 4% to 5%.
  
  Now regarding the portfolio. Invested assets are $16.1 billion, including $15.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $688 million compared to $672 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.5% compared to 4.6% a year ago. With a low portfolio leverage of 3.2x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding the unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 14%.
  
  Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains on fixed maturity portfolio of $935 million, approximately $732 million lower than the year ago due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
  
  In the second quarter, we invested $182 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.16%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 18 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.57%, down 11 basis points from the 5.68% yield in the second quarter of 2017. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%.
  
  At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new money rate of around 5% for the remainder of the year.
  
  We would like to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets, since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60.
  
  While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
  
  Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,573916088,1512951,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the in",826,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $325 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year of $48 million, we currently expect to have around $375 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.
  
  In the second quarter, we spent $88 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $84.54. So far in July, we have spent $20 million to purchase 243,000 shares at an average price of $83. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $195 million of parent company cash to acquire approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $85.16. These purchases are being made for the parent company's excess cash flow.
  
  As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
  
  Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rating. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation and proposed adjustments to the NAIC RBC factors, we are having discussions with the rating agencies to determine the appropriate target consolidated RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries going forward. We will continue our dialogue with them over the next several months before making any final decisions.
  
  In June, the NAIC issued adjustments to certain RBC factors to reflect the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These new factors will be effective for 2018. Taking into account these new factors, we have roughly estimated that our company action level RBC ratio for year-end 2018 could be in the range of 275% to 285%. As previously noted, we have not yet finalized our target RBC ratio. However, if we were to set a target ratio of 300% to 325%, it would require approximately $100 million to $225 million of additional capital.
  
  We understand that we may not be required to meet the appropriate target RBC ratio immediately, and that we would be allowed -- could be allowed to reach the target over a period of time. Given the fact that tax reform increase our GAAP equity substantially and, thus, lower our debt-to-capital ratio, we have additional borrowing capacity. Thus, we are confident that we can find any amounts to be contributed without a significant impact on our excess cash flow. Furthermore, any additional borrowings should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital will be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
  
  Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 17% compared to 15% in the year ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the second quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal winter claims in the second quarter of 2017. On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 15% to 17%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17%. We are obviously pleased to see the underwriting income from Direct Response increasing here.
  
  With respect to our stock compensation expense, we saw an increase during the quarter, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We are anticipating the expense for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million.
  
  Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.02 to $6.12 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.07 midpoint of this guidance reflects the $0.07 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6 primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response channel.
  
  Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $606 million, and life underwriting margin was $169 million, up 10% from a year ago.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $255 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 8%.

At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%.The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% fro",806,"Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%.
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from a year ago but up 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7066.
Although we're still optimistic about American Income's growth potential, we do have some challenges. First, we have opened 10 new offices this year. While this is great news because it supports sustainable, long-term growth, it does impact production in the near term as top middle managers leave existing offices to become agency owners in new offices.
In addition, our economic conditions have historically have impact on agent growth in American Income. Unemployment is currently at a 50-year low. This has resulted in an uptick in new agent termination of the rates due to the abundance of career opportunities.
There is 1 issue, however, that we do not consider to be a challenge. There have been reports of discussion recently regarding the potential impact of the Supreme Court ruling that prohibits public unions from assessing collective bargaining fees from nonunion members. As we said on the last call, we do not believe this will have a significant impact in American Income. We expect to see a reduction of only about 2% in American Income's overall lead production as a result of the ruling. In addition, we do not expect an impact as a consistency of our enforced business. These policies or individual policies not tied to union membership but premium collected directly from the individual policyholders. As we have discussed previously, the great majority of our new business leads are not union leads. Furthermore, our union leads have been more weighted towards private unions. Our American Income's labor advisory board has significant representation from public unions. Our penetration in the public union membership has historically been low. There is no correlation between the makeup of an advisory board and our mix of business or leads Actually, we believe the court's ruling rates an opportunity to improve relationships with public unions as same for ways to incorporate programs that add value to union memberships.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $70 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 11% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 1% to $12 million, and net health sales were $5 million, up 4% from a year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2180, up 2% from a year ago and approximately the same as the second quarter. The tradition agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2221.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $208 million, and life underwriting margin increased 27% to $39 million. Net life sales were down 4% to $30 million. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $69 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $17 million. Health net sales grew 13% to $16 million.
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1086, up 6% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1143.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $96 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 40% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be as follows: American Income, at the end of 2018, around 7000; for 2019, 1% to 7% growth; Liberty National, at the end of 2018, around 2250, for 2019, flat to 7% growth; Family Heritage, at the end of 2018, around 1185, for 2019, 1% to 5% growth.
Approximate life net sales are expected to be as follows: American Income, for the full year 2018, flat to 1% growth. For 2019, 3% to 7% growth; Liberty National, for the full year 2018, 6% to 7% growth. For 2019, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response, for the full year 2018, 6% to 9% decline. For 2019, flat to 4% growth. Total net sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, for the full year 2018, 5% to 6% growth, for 2019, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, for the full year 2018, 7% to 9% growth. For 2019, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement, for the full year 2018, 20% to 22% growth. For 2019, 6% to 10% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 1% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 6%. For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow about 2%, which would result in a per share increase of about 5%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.8 billion, including $15.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds or $682 million compared to $661 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds and fixed maturities is 4.4%, same as the year-ago quarter. With a portfolio leverage of 3.1x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 14%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year-ago quarter. We have net unrealized gains with fixed maturity portfolio of $769 million, approximately $165 million lower than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Asset investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $206 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.14% and an average rating of BBB+ in an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.56%, down 8 basis points from the 5.64% yield in the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average fixed maturity annuity rate of 5.2% in the fourth grade and a weighted average rate of 5.4% in 2019.
We were encouraged by the recent increase in interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses or interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the attempt and, more impotently, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy by 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 million to purchase 403,000 shares at an average price of $85.28.
Thus for the full year through today, we have spent $284 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $85.51. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $340 million. With $284 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $56 million available to the parent for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flows plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these bonds to support our insurance company operations.
Looking forward to 2019, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $345 million to $365 million.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. For the past several years, that level have been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In line with the current tax reform legislation, which change the NAIC RBC factors, and following discussions with our rating agencies, we are reducing the targeted consolidated RBC ratio to be in the range of 300% to 320%. This is not representative tend to hold lower statutory capital within the regular good subsidiaries but simply reflect the fact that the amount of required capital which represents the denominator in that ratio has increased. In fact, the overall quality of statutory capital maintained with our insurance of securities post-tax reform will be greater as deferred tax assets would have been replaced with invested assets.
On September 27, 2018, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.55% senior notes due in 2028. The company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $543 million to redeem on October 29 for approximately $304 million the 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2019, including a medical premium as well as define approximately $150 million of additional capital in the insurance company.
The company also intends to utilize the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including approximately $75 million for the repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper.
Following the redemption of the 9.25% senior notes, Torchmark's debt-to-capital ratio should be below 25%, less than the 26% ratio carried prior to tax reform and less than a 30% ratio that supports our current ratings.
With the additional capital in the insurance companies, our statutory capital will not only exceed previous levels. But as previously noted, the quality of the capital maintained will be greater.
In conjunction with the new senior debt issuance, each of our rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch, affirmed their existing rates. Moody's also indicated that they were with this threshold RBC level for our current rating from 325% to 300%. While A.M. Best affirmed its A- rating on our new debt issue, it is our understanding that their not normal practice is to not formally review the negative outlook placed on our rating until their next regularly scheduled review in 2019.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 16% in the year ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the third quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal claims in the third quarter of 2017. While the 19% margin percentage for the quarter was higher than anticipated, it was within the overall range we expected.
On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 16% to 18%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17.6%. While very early, we think the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 17% to 18% range in 2019.
With respect our stock compensation expense, consistent with previous quarters, we saw an increase in the expense during the quarter compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We still anticipate the expense for 2018 to be approximately $22 million. For 2019, we expect the expense to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million. As Gary noted, our net operating earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.59, $0.04 higher than our internal estimate of $1.55 per share for the quarter. The excess earnings were primarily attributable to better-than-expected results, not only in our Direct Response operations but also in our American Income and Family Heritage channels. The underwriting margin percentage for each of these channel that the high end of our expectations and the results for American Income and Family Heritage were at 5-year highs. As such, we believe this favorable experience with a fluctuation and that underwriting margin percentages will revert to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2018 and 2019, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.08 to $6.14 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.11 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.07, primarily attributable to the positive results in underwriting income especially for our Direct Response and American Income channels.
For 2019, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.45 to $6.75 an 8% increase at the midpoint from 2018. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

So part of this an unfavorable comparison. However, the -- we were expecting a lower policy obligation ratio in the third quarter this year because that's the normal seasonal pattern and that pattern didn't occur. So we expect -- we do expect that that's just fluctuation and it will return back or of a normal pattern. But still, because we had the higher order, we're going to be at the higher ratio this year than we were in 2017. So that's about a point difference in the margin. The other main difference in the Liberty National margin is in the non-deferred commissions and amortization expenses. We're running about a percentage point higher, running around 38% versus 37% last year. And the reason for that is because the amortization on the business and the previous few years is higher, the amortization rate on the overall in force block of business that's running off. So and that will probably then will continue. Looking forward, for the year, we're about 24% underwriting margin. We expect to end up around that for the year. And we're also, the 2019, we're expecting the amortization percentage to creep up a little bit, but we also expect that the policy obligations will revert back to more of the 36% range as opposed to 37%. So to sum that up for 2019, we're looking for the margins to stay around that 24% level."

We saw around $500 million of capacity there, and we would have access to that just through our bank line. But even if they didn't have the bank line for some reason and access to take public markets, we know that we have free cash flow coming up in that $340 million, $360 million range. Next year, we would anticipate it for the year after that, and so that's just creates that added amount of liquidity for us. So take all those together, it gives us a good confidence that if we do have some downgrades, if we do have some impairments, there will be other deal with that when the time comes."

As the changes include we're going to increase our new agent for commission and new monthly bonuses for agents to encourage attention. We're increasing bonus of our managers to train new agents.

And really at this point in time, we're still reviewing the amendments in determining what changes will ultimately need to make to our systems and process to be able to comply, so it will be a lot of work between now and then. I think at a very high level, you have a couple of things that are changing and set of changes and assumptions with respect to your future cash flows, changes of assumptions, will have to flow through net income and at least you have the potential for some of that to get unlocked. And then kind of the way the bigger change is going to be revalued reserves were only using internal market rate but at least -- but those adjustments to the interest rate will flow through OCI, so the impact overall current operations. So I think in general comment, it looks like that the companies that may be right policies that have some of these margin risk benefits that I talked about in the guidance may tend to have a volatility because it's just a little bit harder to nail down those future assumptions on those future cash flows.

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of September 30 was 12.4%, and book value per share was $48.35. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7% and book value per share grew 26% to $43.10.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $606 million, and life underwriting margin was $169 million, up 10% from a year ago. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $255 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 8%.
Administrative expenses were $56 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.

At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from",806,"Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from a year ago but up 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,066.
Although we're still optimistic about American Income's growth potential, we do have some current challenges. First, we have opened 10 new offices this year. While this is great news because it supports sustainable long-term growth, it does impact production in the near term as top middle managers leave existing offices to become agency owners in new offices.
In addition, while economic conditions have historically have little impact on agent growth in American Income, unemployment is currently at a 50-year low. This has resulted in an uptick in new agent terminational rates due to the abundance of other career opportunities.
There is one issue, however, that we do not consider to be a challenge. There have been reports and discussion recently regarding the potential impact of a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits public unions from assessing collective bargaining fees to nonunion members. As we said on the last call, we do not believe this will have a significant impact at American Income. We expect to see a reduction of only about 2% in American Income's overall lead production as a result of the ruling. In addition, we do not expect an impact to the persistency of our in-forced business. These policies or individual policies not tied to union membership. The premiums are collected directly from the individual policyholders. 
As we have discussed previously, the great majority of our new business leads are not union leads. Furthermore, our union leads are more weighted towards private unions. While American Income's labor advisory board has significant representation from public unions, our penetration into public union membership has historically been low. There is no correlation between the makeup of our advisory board and our mix of business or leads. 
Actually, we believe the court's ruling creates an opportunity to improve relationships with public unions as they look for ways to incorporate programs that add value to union membership.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was down 11% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 1% to $12 million; and net health sales were $5 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,180, up 2% from a year ago and approximately the same as the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,221.
Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $208 million, and life underwriting margin increased 27% to $39 million. Net life sales were down 4% to $30 million. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $69 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $17 million. Health net sales grew 13% to $16 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,086, up 6% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,143.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $96 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 40% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be as follows. American Income at the end of 2018, around 7,000; for 2019, 1% to 7% growth. Liberty National at the end of 2018, around 2,250; for 2019, flat to 7% growth. Family Heritage at the end of 2018, around 1,185; for 2019, 1% to 5% growth.
Approximate life net sales are expected to be as follows. American Income for the full year 2018, flat to 1% growth; for 2019, 3% to 7% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 6% to 7% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2018, 6% to 9% decline; for 2019, flat to 4% growth. 
Health net sales are expected to be as follows. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 5% to 6% growth; for 2019, 4% to 8% growth. Family Heritage for the full year of 2018, 7% to 9% growth; for 2019, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement for the full year 2018, 20% to 22% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 1% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 6%. For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow about 2%, which would result in a per share increase of about 5%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.8 billion, including $15.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $682 million compared to $661 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.4%, same as the year-ago quarter. With a portfolio leverage of 3.1x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains with fixed maturities, is 14%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year-ago quarter. 
We have net unrealized gains with the fixed maturity portfolio of $769 million, approximately $165 million lower than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
As to investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $206 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.14% and an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.56%, down 8 basis points from the 5.64% yield in the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average fixed maturity new money rate of 5.2% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 5.4% in 2019.
We were encouraged by the recent increase in interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses or interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more impotently, the ability, to hold our investments to maturity.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank."

So far in October, we have spent $34 millio",1142,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 million to purchase 403,000 shares at an average price of $85.28. Thus for the full year through today, we have spent $284 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $85.51. 
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $340 million. With $284 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $56 million available to the parent for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flows, plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. Looking forward to 2019, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $345 million to $365 million.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain at capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. For the past several years, that level had been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation, which changed the NAIC RBC factors, and following discussions with our rating agencies, we are reducing the targeted consolidated RBC ratio to be in the range of 300% to 320%. This is not represent an intent to hold lower statutory capital within the regulated subsidiaries, but simply reflects the fact that the amount of required capital, which represents the denominator in that ratio, has increased. In fact, the overall quality of statutory capital maintained with our insurance subsidiaries post-tax reform will be greater as deferred tax assets will have been replaced with invested assets.
On September 27, 2018, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.55% senior notes due in 2028. The company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $543 million to redeem, on October 29 for approximately $304 million, the 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2019, including a make whole premium; as well as to fund approximately $150 million of additional capital in the insurance company. The company also intends to utilize the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including approximately $75 million for the repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper.
Following the redemption of the 9.25% senior notes, Torchmark's debt-to-capital ratio should be below 25%, less than the 26% ratio carried prior to tax reform and less than the 30% ratio that supports our current ratings. With the additional capital in the insurance companies, our statutory capital will not only exceed previous levels. But as previously noted, the quality of the capital maintained will be greater.
In conjunction with the new senior debt issuance, each of our rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch, affirmed their existing ratings. Moody's also indicated that they were with the threshold RBC level for our current rating from 325% to 300%. While A.M. Best affirmed its A- rating on our new debt issue, it is our understanding that their normal practice is to not formally review the negative outlook placed on our rating until their next regularly scheduled review in 2019.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operation, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 16% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the third quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal claims in the third quarter of 2017. While the 19% margin percentage for the quarter was higher than we anticipated, it was within the overall range we expected.
On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 16% to 18%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17.6%. While very early, we think the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 17% to 18% range in 2019.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, consistent with previous quarters, we saw an increase in the expense during the quarter compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We still anticipate the expense for 2018 to be approximately $22 million. For 2019, we expect the expense to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million. 
As Gary noted, our net operating earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.59, $0.04 higher than our internal estimate of $1.55 per share for the quarter. The excess earnings were primarily attributable to better-than-expected results, not only in our Direct Response operations, but also in our American Income and Family Heritage channels. The underwriting margin percentage for each of these channels is at the high end of our expectations, and the results for American Income and Family Heritage were at 5-year highs. As such, we believe this favorable experience was a fluctuation and that underwriting margin percentages will revert to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2018 and 2019, we are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.08 to $6.14 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.11 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.07, primarily attributable to the positive results in underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response and American Income channels.
For 2019, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.45 to $6.75, an 8% increase at the midpoint from 2018. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

So part of it's an unfavorable comparison. However, the -- we were expecting a lower policy obligation ratio in third quarter this year because that's the normal seasonal pattern, and that pattern didn't occur. So we expect -- we do expect that that's just fluctuation and it will return back in more of a normal pattern. But still, because we had the higher order, we're going to be able to get a higher ratio this year than we were in 2017. So that's about a point difference in the margin. The other main difference in the Liberty National margins is in the non-deferred commissions and amortization expenses. We're running about a percentage point higher, running around 38% versus 37% last year. And the reason for that is because as the amortization on the business in the previous few years is higher than the amortization rate on the older in-force block of business that's running off. So -- and that will probably -- that will continue. Looking forward, for the year, we're about 24% underwriting margin. We expect to end up around that for the year. And we're also, to 2019, we're expecting the amortization percentage to creep up a little bit, but we also expect that the policy obligations will revert back to more of the 36% range as opposed to 37%. So to sum that up for 2019, we're looking for the margins to stay around that 24% level."

At around -- our debt-to-cap ratio at the end of the year will probably be a little less than 25% once the 9.25% is actually redeemed, so just kind of fall within that 30% ratio that our rating agencies like to see as a maximum. We still have around $500 million of capacity there. And we really have access to that just through our bank line.

And really at this point in time, we're still reviewing the amendments in determining what changes we'll ultimately need to make to our systems and processes to be able to comply.

And at least you have the potential for some of that to get unlocked. And then the kind of the -- really, the bigger change is going to be that you'll revalue reserves quarterly using internal market rate. But at least -- but those adjustments to the interest rate will flow through OCI, so won't impact overall current operations. So I think, in general, looks like that the companies that may be right, policies that have some of these margin risk benefits that are talked about in the guidance may tend to have a volatility because it's just a little bit harder to nail down those -- the future assumptions on those future cash flows. With the nature of our products, again, there's a lot of work, and we really haven't been able to see exactly what impact it's going to have on us.

Net operating income for the quarter was $183 million or $1.59 per share, a per share increase of 29% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 10%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of September 30 was 12.4%, and book value per share was $48.35. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7% and book value per share grew 26% to $43.10.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $606 million, and life underwriting margin was $169 million, up 10% from a year ago. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $255 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 8%.
Administrative expenses were $56 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up around 5% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.

At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from",807,"Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from a year ago but up 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,066.
Although we're still optimistic about American Income's growth potential, we do have some current challenges. First, we have opened 10 new offices this year. While this is great news because it supports sustainable long-term growth, it does impact production in the near term as top middle managers leave existing offices to become agency owners in new offices.
In addition, while economic conditions have historically have little impact on agent growth in American Income, unemployment is currently at a 50-year low. This has resulted in an uptick in new agent termination rates due to the abundance of other career opportunities.
There is one issue, however, that we do not consider to be a challenge. There have been reports and discussion recently regarding the potential impact of a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits public unions from assessing collective bargaining fees to nonunion members. As we said on the last call, we do not believe this will have a significant impact at American Income. We expect to see a reduction of only about 2% in American Income's overall lead production as a result of the ruling. In addition, we do not expect an impact to the persistency of our in-forced business. These policies are individual policies not tied to union membership. The premiums are collected directly from the individual policyholders. 
As we have discussed previously, the great majority of our new business leads are not union leads. Furthermore, our union leads are more weighted towards private unions. While American Income's labor advisory board has significant representation from public unions, our penetration into public union membership has historically been low. There is no correlation between the makeup of our advisory board and our mix of business or leads. 
Actually, we believe the court's ruling creates an opportunity to improve relationships with public unions as they look for ways to incorporate programs that add value to union membership.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was down 11% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 1% to $12 million; and net health sales were $5 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,180, up 2% from a year ago and approximately the same as the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,221.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $208 million, and life underwriting margin increased 27% to $39 million. Net life sales were down 4% to $30 million. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $69 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $17 million. Health net sales grew 13% to $16 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,086, up 6% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,143.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $96 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 40% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be as follows. American Income at the end of 2018, around 7,000; for 2019, 1% to 7% growth. Liberty National at the end of 2018, around 2,250; for 2019, flat to 7% growth. Family Heritage at the end of 2018, around 1,185; for 2019, 1% to 5% growth.
Approximate life net sales are expected to be as follows. American Income for the full year 2018, flat to 1% growth; for 2019, 3% to 7% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 6% to 7% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2018, 6% to 9% decline; for 2019, flat to 4% growth. 
Health net sales are expected to be as follows. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 5% to 6% growth; for 2019, 4% to 8% growth. Family Heritage for the full year of 2018, 7% to 9% growth; for 2019, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement for the full year 2018, 20% to 22% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth.
I'll now turn the call back to Gary."

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 1% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 6%. For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow about 2%, which would result in a per share increase of about 5%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.8 billion, including $15.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $682 million compared to $661 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.4%, same as the year-ago quarter. With a portfolio leverage of 3.1x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains with fixed maturities, is 14%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year-ago quarter. 
We have net unrealized gains with the fixed maturity portfolio of $769 million, approximately $165 million lower than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
As to investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $206 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.14% and an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.56%, down 8 basis points from the 5.64% yield in the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average fixed maturity new money rate of 5.2% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 5.4% in 2019.
We were encouraged by the recent increase in interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses or interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability, to hold our investments to maturity.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 millio",1142,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 million to purchase 403,000 shares at an average price of $85.28. Thus for the full year through today, we have spent $284 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $85.51. 
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $340 million. With $284 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $56 million available to the parent for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flows, plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. Looking forward to 2019, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $345 million to $365 million.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For the past several years, that level had been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation, which changed the NAIC RBC factors, and following discussions with our rating agencies, we are reducing the targeted consolidated RBC ratio to be in the range of 300% to 320%. This does not represent an intent to hold lower statutory capital within the regulated subsidiaries, but simply reflects the fact that the amount of required capital, which represents the denominator in that ratio, has increased. In fact, the overall quality of statutory capital maintained with our insurance subsidiaries post-tax reform will be greater as deferred tax assets will have been replaced with invested assets.
On September 27, 2018, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.55% senior notes due in 2028. The company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $543 million to redeem, on October 29 for approximately $304 million, the 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2019, including a make whole premium; as well as to fund approximately $150 million of additional capital in the insurance company. The company also intends to utilize the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including approximately $75 million for the repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper.
Following the redemption of the 9.25% senior notes, Torchmark's debt-to-capital ratio should be below 25%, less than the 26% ratio carried prior to tax reform and less than the 30% ratio that supports our current ratings. With the additional capital in the insurance companies, our statutory capital will not only exceed previous levels. But as previously noted, the quality of the capital maintained will be greater.
In conjunction with the new senior debt issuance, each of our rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch, affirmed their existing ratings. Moody's also indicated that they were with the threshold RBC level for our current rating from 325% to 300%. While A.M. Best affirmed its A- rating on our new debt issue, it is our understanding that their normal practice is to not formally review the negative outlook placed on our rating until their next regularly scheduled review in 2019.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operation, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 16% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the third quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal claims in the third quarter of 2017. While the 19% margin percentage for the quarter was higher than we anticipated, it was within the overall range we expected.
On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 16% to 18%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17.6%. While very early, we think the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 17% to 18% range in 2019.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, consistent with previous quarters, we saw an increase in the expense during the quarter compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We still anticipate the expense for 2018 to be approximately $22 million. For 2019, we expect the expense to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million. 
As Gary noted, our net operating earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.59, $0.04 higher than our internal estimate of $1.55 per share for the quarter. The excess earnings were primarily attributable to better-than-expected results, not only in our Direct Response operations, but also in our American Income and Family Heritage channels. The underwriting margin percentage for each of these channels is at the high end of our expectations, and the results for American Income and Family Heritage were at 5-year highs. As such, we believe this favorable experience was a fluctuation and that underwriting margin percentages will revert to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2018 and 2019, we are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.08 to $6.14 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.11 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.07, primarily attributable to the positive results in underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response and American Income channels.
For 2019, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.45 to $6.75, an 8% increase at the midpoint from 2018. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

So part of it's an unfavorable comparison. However, the -- we were expecting a lower policy obligation ratio in third quarter this year because that's the normal seasonal pattern, and that pattern didn't occur. So we expect -- we do expect that that's just fluctuation and it will return back to more of a normal pattern. But still, because we had the higher order, we're going to be able to get a higher ratio this year than we were in 2017. So that's about a point difference in the margin. The other main difference in the Liberty National margins is in the non-deferred commissions and amortization expenses. We're running about a percentage point higher, running around 38% versus 37% last year. And the reason for that is because as the amortization on the business in the previous few years is higher than the amortization rate on the older in-force block of business that's running off. So -- and that will probably -- that will continue. Looking forward, for the year, we're about 24% underwriting margin. We expect to end up around that for the year. And we're also, to 2019, we're expecting the amortization percentage to creep up a little bit, but we also expect that the policy obligations will revert back to more of the 36% range as opposed to 37%. So to sum that up for 2019, we're looking for the margins to stay around that 24% level."

At around -- our debt-to-cap ratio at the end of the year will probably be a little less than 25% once the 9.25% is actually redeemed, so just kind of fall within that 30% ratio that our rating agencies like to see as a maximum.

And really at this point in time, we're still reviewing the amendments in determining what changes we'll ultimately need to make to our systems and processes to be able to comply.

And at least you have the potential for some of that to get unlocked. And then the kind of the -- really, the bigger change is going to be that you'll revalue reserves quarterly using internal market rate. But at least -- but those adjustments to the interest rate will flow through OCI, so won't impact overall current operations. So I think, in general, looks like that the companies that may be right, policies that have some of these margin risk benefits that are talked about in the guidance may tend to have a little bit more volatility because it's just a little bit harder to nail down those -- the future assumptions on those future cash flows. With the nature of our products, again, there's a lot of work, and we really haven't been able to see exactly what impact it's going to have on us.

Net operating income for the quarter was $183 million or $1.59 per share, a per share increase of 29% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 10%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of September 30 was 12.4%, and book value per share was $48.35. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7% and book value per share grew 26% to $43.10.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $606 million, and life underwriting margin was $169 million, up 10% from a year ago. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in American Income and Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $255 million, and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 8%.
Administrative expenses were $56 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up around 5% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.

At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from",807,"Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7105, down 1% from a year ago but up 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,066.
Although we're still optimistic about American Income's growth potential, we do have some current challenges. First, we have opened 10 new offices this year. While this is great news because it supports sustainable long-term growth, it does impact production in the near term as top middle managers leave existing offices to become agency owners in new offices.
In addition, while economic conditions have historically have little impact on agent growth in American Income, unemployment is currently at a 50-year low. This has resulted in an uptick in new agent termination rates due to the abundance of other career opportunities.
There is one issue, however, that we do not consider to be a challenge. There have been reports and discussion recently regarding the potential impact of a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits public unions from assessing collective bargaining fees to nonunion members. As we said on the last call, we do not believe this will have a significant impact at American Income. We expect to see a reduction of only about 2% in American Income's overall lead production as a result of the ruling. In addition, we do not expect an impact to the persistency of our in-forced business. These policies are individual policies not tied to union membership. The premiums are collected directly from the individual policyholders. 
As we have discussed previously, the great majority of our new business leads are not union leads. Furthermore, our union leads are more weighted towards private unions. While American Income's labor advisory board has significant representation from public unions, our penetration into public union membership has historically been low. There is no correlation between the makeup of our advisory board and our mix of business or leads. 
Actually, we believe the court's ruling creates an opportunity to improve relationships with public unions as they look for ways to incorporate programs that add value to union membership.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was down 11% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 1% to $12 million; and net health sales were $5 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,180, up 2% from a year ago and approximately the same as the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,221.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $208 million, and life underwriting margin increased 27% to $39 million. Net life sales were down 4% to $30 million. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $69 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $17 million. Health net sales grew 13% to $16 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,086, up 6% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,143.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $96 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 40% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be as follows. American Income at the end of 2018, around 7,000; for 2019, 1% to 7% growth. Liberty National at the end of 2018, around 2,250; for 2019, flat to 7% growth. Family Heritage at the end of 2018, around 1,185; for 2019, 1% to 5% growth.
Approximate life net sales are expected to be as follows. American Income for the full year 2018, flat to 1% growth; for 2019, 3% to 7% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 6% to 7% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2018, 6% to 9% decline; for 2019, flat to 4% growth. 
Health net sales are expected to be as follows. Liberty National for the full year 2018, 5% to 6% growth; for 2019, 4% to 8% growth. Family Heritage for the full year of 2018, 7% to 9% growth; for 2019, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement for the full year 2018, 20% to 22% growth; for 2019, 6% to 10% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 1% increa",394,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 1% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 6%. For the full year 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow about 2%, which would result in a per share increase of about 5%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.8 billion, including $15.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $682 million compared to $661 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.4%, same as the year-ago quarter. With a portfolio leverage of 3.1x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains with fixed maturities, is 14%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year-ago quarter. 
We have net unrealized gains with the fixed maturity portfolio of $769 million, approximately $165 million lower than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
As to investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $206 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.14% and an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.56%, down 8 basis points from the 5.64% yield in the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.56%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average fixed maturity new money rate of 5.2% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 5.4% in 2019.
We were encouraged by the recent increase in interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses or interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability, to hold our investments to maturity.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 millio",1142,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $75 million to buy 877,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $85.84. So far in October, we have spent $34 million to purchase 403,000 shares at an average price of $85.28. Thus for the full year through today, we have spent $284 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $85.51. 
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be around $340 million. With $284 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $56 million available to the parent for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flows, plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. Looking forward to 2019, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $345 million to $365 million.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For the past several years, that level had been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. In light of the current tax reform legislation, which changed the NAIC RBC factors, and following discussions with our rating agencies, we are reducing the targeted consolidated RBC ratio to be in the range of 300% to 320%. This does not represent an intent to hold lower statutory capital within the regulated subsidiaries, but simply reflects the fact that the amount of required capital, which represents the denominator in that ratio, has increased. In fact, the overall quality of statutory capital maintained with our insurance subsidiaries post-tax reform will be greater as deferred tax assets will have been replaced with invested assets.
On September 27, 2018, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.55% senior notes due in 2028. The company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $543 million to redeem, on October 29 for approximately $304 million, the 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2019, including a make whole premium; as well as to fund approximately $150 million of additional capital in the insurance company. The company also intends to utilize the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including approximately $75 million for the repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper.
Following the redemption of the 9.25% senior notes, Torchmark's debt-to-capital ratio should be below 25%, less than the 26% ratio carried prior to tax reform and less than the 30% ratio that supports our current ratings. With the additional capital in the insurance companies, our statutory capital will not only exceed previous levels. But as previously noted, the quality of the capital maintained will be greater.
In conjunction with the new senior debt issuance, each of our rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch, affirmed their existing ratings. Moody's also indicated that they were with the threshold RBC level for our current rating from 325% to 300%. While A.M. Best affirmed its A- rating on our new debt issue, it is our understanding that their normal practice is to not formally review the negative outlook placed on our rating until their next regularly scheduled review in 2019.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operation, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 16% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily attributable to favorable claims in the third quarter of this year compared to higher-than-normal claims in the third quarter of 2017. While the 19% margin percentage for the quarter was higher than we anticipated, it was within the overall range we expected.
On our last call, we estimated that the underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 would be in the range of 16% to 18%. Now for the full year 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We are encouraged by the improved claims experience and the fact that the underwriting margin percentage for the last 4 quarters has averaged 17.6%. While very early, we think the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 17% to 18% range in 2019.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, consistent with previous quarters, we saw an increase in the expense during the quarter compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018 as a result of the tax reform legislation. We still anticipate the expense for 2018 to be approximately $22 million. For 2019, we expect the expense to be in the range of $19 million to $23 million. 
As Gary noted, our net operating earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.59, $0.04 higher than our internal estimate of $1.55 per share for the quarter. The excess earnings were primarily attributable to better-than-expected results, not only in our Direct Response operations, but also in our American Income and Family Heritage channels. The underwriting margin percentage for each of these channels is at the high end of our expectations, and the results for American Income and Family Heritage were at 5-year highs. As such, we believe this favorable experience was a fluctuation and that underwriting margin percentages will revert to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2018 and 2019, we are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.08 to $6.14 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6.11 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.07, primarily attributable to the positive results in underwriting income, especially for our Direct Response and American Income channels.
For 2019, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.45 to $6.75, an 8% increase at the midpoint from 2018. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

However, the -- we were expecting a lower policy obligation ratio in third quarter this year because that's the normal seasonal pattern, and that pattern didn't occur. So we expect -- we do expect that that's just fluctuation and it will return back to more of a normal pattern. But still, because we had the higher order, we're going to be able to get a higher ratio this year than we were in 2017. So that's about a point difference in the margin. The other main difference in the Liberty National margins is in the non-deferred commissions and amortization expenses. We're running about a percentage point higher, running around 38% versus 37% last year. And the reason for that is because as the amortization on the business in the previous few years is higher than the amortization rate on the older in-force block of business that's running off. So -- and that will probably -- that will continue. Looking forward, for the year, we're about 24% underwriting margin. We expect to end up around that for the year. And we're also, to 2019, we're expecting the amortization percentage to creep up a little bit, but we also expect that the policy obligations will revert back to more of the 36% range as opposed to 37%. So to sum that up for 2019, we're looking for the margins to stay around that 24% level."
