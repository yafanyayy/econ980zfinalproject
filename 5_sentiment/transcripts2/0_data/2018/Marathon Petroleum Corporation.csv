We issued 2 press releases yesterday, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions. This morning, we repo",1391,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We issued 2 press releases yesterday, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions. This morning, we reported strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved record full year performance along with substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will ask Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results shortly. 
Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 significant 5-year milestones for our company. February marks the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishments since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence, all while achieving lower operating expenses. For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%; achieved numerous processing records, including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone; and cut unplanned downtime in half. We have also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%. 
It has also been 5 years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders, representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation. The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into the midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced the strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors, which we completed today.
As part of these strategic actions, we execute drop-downs through MPLX assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA, adding high-quality fee-based revenue streams to MPLX and further diversifying the partnership's earnings. Following the drop-downs, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear evaluation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This, combined with the elimination of the partnership's IDR burden, creates mutual benefits and positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all its unitholders, including MPC.
Earlier this week, we were very pleased to see standard important to recognize MPLX transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rating to [ BBB+ ]. 
Looking forward, this morning, we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin-enhancing projects, as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses, especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018, excluding MPLX, is $1.6 billion. This planned spending includes $950 million for Refining & Marketing, $530 million for Speedway and $100 million to support corporate activities and other investments. The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately $400 million of growth capital, focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher value products, maximizing distillate production and expanding life product placement flexibility including exports. With the investments we've made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low [ soft ] international bunker fuels requirement in 2020, commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has deep conversion capacity as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low diesel and recede upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments, which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery, which we referred to as the STAR project; the diesel maximization project at Garyville; and the Garyville [ corkage ] expansion. We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build upon its industry-leading position. This significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations.
MPLX also announced its capital investment plan for 2018, including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately $190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes the addition of 8 processing plants, representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental process capacity, as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins. 
The remaining growth capital the partnership has planned for the development of various crude oil and refined products infrastructure, including export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery. As we start the new year, I also want to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018.
From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by more a balance supply and demand environment, which should be supportive of crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think this creates a very productive backdrop for refining margins, in addition to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. Inventories from our balance that they have been for several years. On the days of supply basis, including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006. And U.S. distillate inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone. 
From a crude differential perspective, we expect the Brent-WTI spread to be volatile, but to generally trade a couple of dollars of either side of $5 per barrel. This is based on our view that pipelines are pushing to the Gulf will be relatively full and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials, although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events.
We also expect favorable Canadian crude oil differentials, both heavy and light, over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines in the U.S. will be full and incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have to clear by rail. This should keep heavy differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017. 
We also believe that global and U.S. macro picture remains solid and expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continued to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities at both Galveston Bay and Garyville.
In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is the recent tax reform legislation. The reduction in the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in cash burden on MPC and our high confidence to the long-term cash generation of the business help support our board's decision to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week.
During the quarter, we returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from the drop-down transactions completed during the year. 
Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, $3.7 billion of that $13 billion was in the form of regularly -- of regular quarterly dividends, which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company. Return of capital to shareholders intended to long-term investments in the business and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors. 
As I wrap up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of report called prospectus on climate-related scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate-related strategies, risk and opportunities using the framework recommended by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The report has been very well received by investors and is appointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and the welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?"

We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform. The Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record-setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization.
After the closing of today's drop-down and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector, with a very competitive cost of capital going forward. Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for its unitholders, including MPC. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear additional color on the partnership's performance and opportunities.
Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same-store merchandise sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA, reinforcing the strategic value of this high-performing, stable cash flow business.
Turning to Refining & Marketing. We delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system.
Additionally, we achieved numerous monthly process unit and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017, including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distillate production. As a result, we are now the second largest refiner in the U.S. on a crude throughput basis and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second and third largest refineries, respectively. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year."
118315802,548808304,1378085,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both [ absolute ] and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $2",2119,"Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both [ absolute ] and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share. For the full year, earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016. As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, as a result of remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate. 
The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform, the walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and high utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product gross realizations versus [ spot ] prices using the benchmark crack spread.
Speedway's fourth quarter results were generally comparable to last year. The increase in [ live ] product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin in the quarter. The $47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record, gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Early results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the negative variance of noncontrolling interest. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread [ had ] a $586 million favorable impact of the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.08 -- to $11.08 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread's to $9.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year. 
The light [indiscernible] and sweet -- and Texas intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up of from $1.30 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the WTI link crudes in our slate. This benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there's an offset in the product portion of other margin. 
As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor, which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the strong cracks was $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter driven, primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot price used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in our Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations was [ at ] $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an ex-RIN basis with higher LLS crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blended crack spreads for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017. 
The LLS-WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by 3 factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance in other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and nontransportation fuel product price realizations versus spot prices used in LLS-based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery volumetric gain due to higher refined products price environment and increased throughput volumes in 2017. 
A narrowing contango effect shown in the market chart resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the book used in the benchmark actually could acquisition cost. This will also reflect on a favorable $345 million due to the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016. 
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year results are affected by the transfer Speedway's travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter 2016, Speedway share of the results of operations is reflected as income from the equity method investments and as shown in the other column of this walk, while prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin in other categories. 
Speedway segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. This impacts were partially offset by higher light product margin, which increased to [ $17.02 ] per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from [ $16.17 ] per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the RCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase full year segment income, excluding the LCM benefit, was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year. 
In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedway same-store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices have moved higher and impact from severe winter matter. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid, and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018. 
Slide 10 provides changes in the Midstream segment income, highlighting the [ $47 million ] quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to an increase in contributions from MPLX. MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage asset in 2017. As Don referenced earlier, more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the MPLX earnings call in at 11, and we encourage you to listen in. 
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes and consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash  at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase of approximately $923 million for the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow, before changes of working capital, was an approximately $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net debt was a $73 million source of cash, which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter. 
Return of capital to shareholders by way of share repurchase and dividends totaled $945 million in the quarter, including $750 million of share purchases at a weighted average share price of [ $57.90 ]. As Gary mentioned, that Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividends since becoming an independent company 6 years ago. This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long-term cash generation of the business. 
Since the beginning of the year, we returned over $3 billion of capital MPC shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from drop-down transactions during the year. Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after-tax proceeds from today's drop-down transaction, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. With nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represents 2.2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.4x excluding MPLX. This same metrics including distributions to MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA was 1.3x. We believe the addition of the distributions for MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities, given the importance of stability to MPLX distributions MPC going forward. 
Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. 
On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous drop-downs, the inter-segment earnings associated with the dropdown will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results and as such, prior period results will remain in the interim segment. Importantly, the drop-down of earnings into the midstream segment will not cause any change to RNM margin. Direct operating cost will no longer include costs related to the refining logistics assets and the MPLX [indiscernible] to refining logistics assets as well as to provide fuels distribution services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses. We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expense of approximately $1 billion, with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment. 
For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volume statistics related to the fuels distribution services, although volume risk in partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-service discussion that underlies the arrangement. 
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day, with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total operating costs are expected to be [ $7.90 ] per barrel. As I mentioned in the prior slide, direct operating cost will exclude the costs related to the refiner logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here is adjusted for the drop-down completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance adjusted for the drop impacts on the going-forward basis. While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter we expect a net increase of approximately $230 million resulting from today's drop-down, which includes the fees paid to MPLX for 2 of the 3 months of the first quarter. 
Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017 as we expect sour crude rents to be impacted by planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast. The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items, which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increases in unallocated corporate costs and employee-related expenses, are projected to be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee-related expenses specific to the first quarter. 
Additionally, we've updated MPC's R&M segment price margin sensitivities in the appendix on Slide 21. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?"

Your question about positioning for IMO [ ahead of 2020 ], probably the biggest thing that we have as Gary talked about resid destruction as we have a moderate expansion of our Garyville coker, both coker units we're putting in larger coke crumbs and doing some debottlenecking. That work will be primarily completed on 1 coker Q4 2019 and the other coker, Q1 2020, so right in time there. At our Galveston Bay refinery, we talked over the years about the STAR project, which fits right in with IMO. It's a resid destruction, it's a diesel maximization project. That project has actually stage implementation going back to couple of years and we'll have stage implementation going forward, all the way out to when it finally complete, so it will be Q1 2022. But ahead at IMO, there will be some more implementation there. To follow-up with your other comment about additional projects, in addition to the CapEx for R&M, we always have the backlog of projects that we are doing some level of engineering, and we have some very attractive projects in queue that we'll continue to reevaluate given the current market look and potentially bring some more of those projects forward."

If you look at this week's inventory numbers in the building crude oil, it's just illustrative of refineries not being able to run full out, a number of refineries having temporary blips mostly due to power outage. But all this kind of works together. So I think it is a very temporary thing. And other things that Tony can speak to is we've had a very swift rising crude price. And it has to be able to get the price through the Street. So Tony, you want to talk about how many restoration you've seen so far this year?"

Well, from a macro standpoint, Neil, if you look at the crude inventories, very much in line and looking at just over the last 3 years, a significant, I would say, rebalancing of crude oil across the answer system. So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year. And since your conference, I'm even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the corn producers are continuing to, I think, be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market. And I think on U.S. production side, there's a very strong view that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you're going to see probably we'll get north of 70 this year on the crude price, which I think bodes well for the total utilization of refineries, it bodes well for the drillbit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price you have to get that price to the street. You have to get to the wholesale level as well as the retail level. However, the inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think you're going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and or without some that are scheduled here in PADD II earlier in the year that you would anticipate. I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system. Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market."

As you know, it's always been historically that they push the sell diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline. The other thing is, our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports, Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios, and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are, I only speak for MPC. We are very, very well-positioned for this IMO change is coming. And if gasoline continues to pick up, that's why we're investing in further distribution capabilities, both at the Galveston Bay and Garyville to be able to take bigger cargoes of gasoline."

First of all, let me remind you, the comps you're looking at when you mentioned the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember, we formed this joint venture with Pilot. So we moved sales, margin, expenses out of the detail categories into an equity earnings components. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point is correct, there is some softness in what we look at as transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those overall -- and actually the prior to see some of the growth areas in some of the store that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier will be around some high-growth areas like food service, for example, in convenience stores. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about. As far as the newbuilds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be and we've consistently said this, we're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean, that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years, and we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC's supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our Eastern markets, those are really good MPC supplier and, therefore, we want to take advantage of those synergies are by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply. And the last point on acquisitions, we don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole, my observation would be is at that this consolidated their needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenience store industry. So think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint."

We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.This morning, we reported",1384,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.
This morning, we reported strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved record full year performance along with the substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will ask Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results shortly.
Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 significant 5-year milestones for our company. February marks the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishments since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence, all while achieving lower operating expenses. For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%; achieved numerous processing records, including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone; and cut unplanned downtime in half. We have also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%.
It has also been 5 years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders, representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation. The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into the Midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced the strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors, which we completed today.
As part of the strategic actions, we executed dropdowns through MPLX of assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA, adding high-quality fee-based revenue streams to MPLX and further diversifying the partnership's earnings. Following the dropdowns, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear evaluation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This, combined with elimination of the partnership's IDR burden, creates mutual benefits and positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all its unitholders, including MPC.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to see Standard & Poor's recognize MPLX's transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rating to BBB+.
Looking forward, this morning, we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin-enhancing projects, as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses, especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018, excluding MPLX, is $1.6 billion. This planned spending includes $950 million for Refining & Marketing, $530 million for Speedway and $100 million to support corporate activities and other investments. The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately $400 million of growth capital, focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher-value products, maximizing distillate production and expanding life product placement flexibility, including exports.
With the investments we've made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low-sulfur international bunker fuels requirement in 2020, commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has deep conversion capacity as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low-sulfur diesel and resid upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments, which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery, which we referred to as the STAR project; the diesel maximization project at Garyville; and the Garyville coker expansion.
We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build upon its industry-leading position. This significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations.
MPLX also announced its capital investment plan for 2018, including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately $190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes the addition of 8 processing plants, representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity, as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins.
The remaining growth capital of the partnership is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined products infrastructure, including export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery. As we start the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018.
From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by a more balanced supply-and-demand environment, which should be supportive of crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think this creates a very productive backdrop for refining margins, in addition to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. 
Inventories were more balanced than they have been for several years. On the days of supply basis, including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006. And U.S. distillate inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone.
From a crude-differential perspective, we expect the Brent-WTI spread to be volatile, but to generally trade a couple of dollars on either side of $5 per barrel. This is based on our view that pipelines from Cushing to the Gulf will be relatively full and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials, although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events.
We also expect favorable Canadian crude-oil differentials, both heavy and light, over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines in the U.S. will be full, and incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have to clear by rail. This should keep heavy differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017.
We also believe that global and U.S. macro picture remains solid, and expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continues to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities at both Galveston Bay and Garyville.
In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is the recent tax reform legislation. The reduction in the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in cash burden on MPC and our high confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business help support our board's decision to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week.
During the quarter, we returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including the $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from the dropdown transactions completed during the year.
Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, $3.7 billion of that $13 billion was in the form of regularly -- of regular quarterly dividends, which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company. Return of capital to shareholders and attending long-term investments in the business and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors.
As I wrap up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of report -- of a report, called Perspectives, on climate-related scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate-related strategies, risk and opportunities, using the framework recommended by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The report has been very well-received by investors and is pointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and the welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC.
With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?"

We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform.
The Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record-setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization.
After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector, with a very competitive cost of capital going forward. Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well-positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for its unitholders, including MPC. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear additional color on the partnership's performance and opportunities.
Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same-store merchandise sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA, reinforcing the strategic value of this high-performing, stable cash flow business.
Turning to Refining & Marketing. We delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year, and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system.
Additionally, we achieved numerous monthly process unit and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017, including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distillate production. As a result, we are now the second largest refiner in the U.S. on a crude-throughput basis, and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second- and third-largest refineries, respectively.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year."

For the full year, earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016. As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, as a result of remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform, the walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and high utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices using the benchmark crack spread.
Speedway's fourth quarter results were generally comparable to last year. The increase in life product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin in the quarter. The $47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Earlier results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the negative variance of noncontrolling interest.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $586 million favorable impact to the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.08 -- to $11.08 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread to $9.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year.
The Light Louisiana Sweet and Texas intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up from $1.30 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. These benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there is an offset in the product portion of other margin. As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor, which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the strong cracks was $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations was at $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an ex-RIN basis, with higher LLS crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blended crack spreads for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017.
The LLS-WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by 3 factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance in other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and nontransportation fuel product price realizations versus spot prices used in the LLS-based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery volumetric gain due to higher refined products price environment and increased crude-throughput volumes in 2017.
A narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the prompt crude prices used in the benchmark crack to actual crude acquisition cost. This walk also reflects an unfavorable $345 million due to the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year results are affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway share of the results of operations is reflected as income from the equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories.
Speedway segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. These impacts were partially offset by higher light product margin, which increased to $17.72 per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from $16.17 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the LCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase in full year segment income, excluding the LCM benefit, was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year.
In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedway same-store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices have moved higher and impacts from severe winter weather. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid, and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018.
Slide 10 provides changes in the Midstream segment income, highlighting the $47 million quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to increase in contributions from MPLX. MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets in 2017. As Don referenced earlier, a more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the MPLX earnings call beginning at 11:00 a.m., and we encourage you to listen in.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase of approximately $923 million from the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow, before changes of working capital, was an approximately $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net debt was a $73 million source of cash, which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders, by a way of share repurchases and dividends, totaled $945 million in the quarter, including $750 million of share repurchases, at a weighted average share price of $57.90. As Gary mentioned, that on Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividends since becoming an independent company 6 years ago. This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long-term cash generation of the business.
Since the beginning of the year, we've returned over $3 billion of capital to MPC shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from dropdown transactions during the year. Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after-tax proceeds from today's dropdown transaction, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. We had nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represents 2.2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or about 1.4x excluding MPLX. This same metric, including distributions to MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA, was 1.3x. We believe the addition of the distributions from MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities, given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous dropdowns, the intersegment earnings, associated with the dropdown, will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results, and as such, prior period results will remain in the R&M segment. Importantly, the dropdown of earnings into the Midstream segment will not cause any change to R&M margin. Direct operating cost will no longer include costs related to the refinery -- refining logistics assets and the MPLX fees to manage the refining logistics assets as well as to provide fuels distribution services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses. We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expenses of approximately $1 billion, with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment.
For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volumes statistic related to the fuels distribution services, although volume risks to the partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-services contract that underlies the arrangement.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day, with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.90 per barrel. As I mentioned on the prior slide, direct operating cost will exclude the costs related to the refinery logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here has been adjusted for the dropdown completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance, adjusted for the drop impacts, on the going-forward basis. While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter, we expect a net increase of approximately $230 million, resulting from today's dropdown, which includes the fees paid to MPLX for 2 of the 3 months of the first quarter.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017, as we expect sour crude runs to be impacted by planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast. The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items, which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increases in unallocated corporate costs and employee-related expenses, are projected to be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee-related expenses specific to the first quarter.
Additionally, we will be updating MPC's R&M segment price and margin sensitivities in the appendix on Slide 21.

We too believe that there's significant upside opportunity with IMO, not only in the incremental projects, but on our base business, but we have not taken any of that upside into the IRR calculations on those projects. But when we finish, we're going to be able to destroy approximately -- probably somewhere between 280,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of resid. And on a total-refining-system basis, we're going to be up significantly over 700,000 barrels per day of annual distillate production. So both the resid destruction, our total annual distillate production, we have the ability to swing them between gasoline and distillate when this is complete. And we've always said around 8% to 10%. We'll probably be a little bit higher when we get these projects complete. But high returns and I think significant upside if the market continues to perform like many of us think it will."

If you look since the beginning of MPC and, specifically, in 2017, very, very strong returns to shareholders both in dividends and in share buybacks. You will continue to see, as Tim just highlighted, a significant amount of the after-tax proceeds that we received from these drops, they always going to be available for capital return to shareholders.

And then we had it across the entire Ohio Valley. But we've had 2 to 3 major ice storms where things just were shut down. I think that proves out, if you look at this week's inventory numbers and the building of crude oil, it's just illustrative of the refineries not being able to run full-out. A number of refineries having temporary blips, mostly due to power outage. But all this kind of works together. So I think it is a very temporary thing.

Well, from a macro standpoint, Neil, if you look at the crude inventories, very much in line and looking at just over the last 3 years, a significant, I would say, rebalancing of crude oil across the entire system. So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year. And since your conference, I'm even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the foreign producers are continuing to, I think, be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market. And I think, on the U.S. production side, there's a very strong view of a -- that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you're going to see, probably, we'll get north of $70 this year on the crude price, which I think bodes well for the total utilization of refineries. I think it bodes well for the drill bit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price, you have to get that price through the Street. Going to have to get to the wholesale level as well as the retail level. However, inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think you're -- we're going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and -- we already know some that are scheduled here in PADD II earlier in the year than you would anticipate. And I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system. Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market."

As you know, it's always been historically that they push diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are -- have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline. And the other thing is, our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports, whether it's the Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios, and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are -- I only speak for MPC, we are very, very well-positioned before this IMO change is coming.

And then as we think about expansion, is that a function of new markets or better locations within existing markets?

First of all, let me remind you, the comps you're looking at, when you mentioned the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember, we formed this joint venture with Pilot.

First of all, let me remind you, the comps you're looking at, when you mentioned the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember, we formed this joint venture with Pilot. So we moved sales, margin, expenses out of the detailed categories into an equity earnings components. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point's correct. There is some softness in what we look at as transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those are all -- and actually the priorities in some of the growth areas in some of the store, that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier, will be around some high-growth areas like food service, for example, in convenience stores. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about. As far as the newbuilds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be, and we've consistently said this, we're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean, that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years, and we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC's supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our Eastern markets, those are really good MPC supply areas and, therefore, we want to take advantage of those synergies by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply. And the last point on acquisitions, we don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole, my observation would be is that it's consolidating, their needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenience store industry. So I think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint."

We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.This morning, we reported",1386,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.
This morning, we reported strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved record full year performance along with the substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will ask Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results shortly.
Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 significant 5-year milestones for our company. February marks the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishments since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence, all while achieving lower operating expenses. For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%; achieved numerous processing records, including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone; and cut unplanned downtime in half. We have also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%.
It has also been 5 years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders, representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation. The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into the Midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced the strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors, which we completed today.
As part of the strategic actions, we executed dropdowns through MPLX of assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA, adding high-quality fee-based revenue streams to MPLX and further diversifying the partnership's earnings. Following the dropdowns, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear valuation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This, combined with elimination of the partnership's IDR burden, creates mutual benefits and positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all its unitholders, including MPC.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to see Standard & Poor's recognize MPLX's transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rating to BBB flat.
Looking forward, this morning, we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin-enhancing projects, as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses, especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018, excluding MPLX, is $1.6 billion. This planned spending includes $950 million for Refining & Marketing, $530 million for Speedway and $100 million to support corporate activities and other investments. The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately $400 million of growth capital, focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher-value products, maximizing distillate production and expanding life product placement flexibility, including exports.
With the investments we've made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low-sulfur international bunker fuels requirement in 2020, commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has deep conversion capacity as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low-sulfur diesel and resid upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments, which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery, which we referred to as the STAR project; the diesel maximization project at Garyville; and the Garyville coker expansion.
We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build upon its industry-leading position. This significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations.
MPLX also announced its capital investment plan for 2018, including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately $190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes the addition of 8 processing plants, representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity, as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins.
The remaining growth capital of the partnership is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined products infrastructure, including export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery. As we start the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018.
From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by a more balanced supply-and-demand environment, which should be supportive of crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think this creates a very productive backdrop for refining margins, in addition to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. 
Inventories were more balanced than they have been for several years. On the days of supply basis, including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006. And U.S. distillate inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone.
From a crude-differential perspective, we expect the Brent-WTI spread to be volatile, but to generally trade a couple of dollars on either side of $5 per barrel. This is based on our view that pipelines from Cushing to the Gulf will be relatively full and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials, although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events.
We also expect favorable Canadian crude-oil differentials, both heavy and light, over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines in the U.S. will be full, and incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have to clear by rail. This should keep heavy differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017.
We also believe that global and U.S. macro picture remains solid, and expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continues to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities at both Galveston Bay and Garyville.
In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is the recent tax reform legislation. The reduction in the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in cash burden on MPC and our high confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business help support our board's decision to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week.
During the quarter, we returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including the $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from the dropdown transactions completed during the year.
Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, $3.7 billion of that $13 billion was in the form of regularly -- of regular quarterly dividends, which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company. Return of capital to shareholders and attend to long-term investments in the business and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors.
As I wrap up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of report -- of a report, called Perspectives, on climate-related scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate-related strategies, risk and opportunities, using the framework recommended by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The report has been very well-received by investors and is pointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and the welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC.
With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?"

We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform.
The Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record-setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization.
After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector, with a very competitive cost of capital going forward. Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well-positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for its unitholders, including MPC. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear additional color on the partnership's performance and opportunities.
Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same-store merchandise sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA, reinforcing the strategic value of this high-performing, stable cash flow business.
Turning to Refining & Marketing. We delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year, and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system.
Additionally, we achieved numerous monthly process unit and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017, including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distillate production. As a result, we are now the second largest refiner in the U.S. on a crude-throughput basis, and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second- and third-largest refineries, respectively.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year."
118315802,548808304,1379001,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $22",2125,"Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share. For the full year, earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016. As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, as a result of remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform, the walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and high utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices using the benchmark crack spread.
Speedway's fourth quarter results were generally comparable to last year. The increase in life product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin in the quarter. The $47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Earlier results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the negative variance on noncontrolling interest.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $586 million favorable impact to the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.08 -- to $11.08 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread to $9.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year.
The Light Louisiana Sweet and Texas intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up from $1.30 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. These benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there is an offset in the product portion of other margin. As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor, which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the strong cracks was $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations was at $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an ex-RIN basis, with higher LLS crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blended crack spreads for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017.
The LLS-WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by 3 factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance in other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and nontransportation fuel product price realizations versus spot prices used in the LLS-based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery volumetric gain due to higher refined products price environment and increased crude-throughput volumes in 2017.
A narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the prompt crude prices used in the benchmark crack to actual crude acquisition cost. This walk also reflects an unfavorable $345 million due to the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year results are affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway share of the results of operations is reflected as income from the equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories.
Speedway segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. These impacts were partially offset by higher light product margin, which increased to $17.72 per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from $16.17 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the LCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase in full year segment income, excluding the LCM benefit, was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year.
In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedway same-store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices have moved higher and impacts from severe winter weather. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid, and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018.
Slide 10 provides changes in the Midstream segment income, highlighting the $47 million quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to increase in contributions from MPLX. MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets in 2017. As Don referenced earlier, a more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the MPLX earnings call beginning at 11:00 a.m., and we encourage you to listen in.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase of approximately $923 million from the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow, before changes of working capital, was an approximately $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net debt was a $73 million source of cash, which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders, by a way of share repurchases and dividends, totaled $945 million in the quarter, including $750 million of share repurchases, at a weighted average share price of $57.90. As Gary mentioned, that on Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividends since becoming an independent company 6 years ago. This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long-term cash generation of the business.
Since the beginning of the year, we've returned over $3 billion of capital to MPC shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from dropdown transactions during the year. Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after-tax proceeds from today's dropdown transaction, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. We had nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represents 2.2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or about 1.4x excluding MPLX. This same metric, including distributions to MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA, was 1.3x. We believe the addition of the distributions from MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities, given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous dropdowns, the intersegment earnings, associated with the dropdown, will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results, and as such, prior period results will remain in the R&M segment. Importantly, the dropdown of earnings into the Midstream segment will not cause any change to R&M margin. Direct operating cost will no longer include costs related to the refinery -- refining logistics assets and the MPLX fees to manage the refining logistics assets as well as to provide fuels distribution services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses. We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expenses of approximately $1 billion, with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment.
For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volumes statistic related to the fuels distribution services, although volume risks to the partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-services contract that underlies the arrangement.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day, with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.90 per barrel. As I mentioned on the prior slide, direct operating cost will exclude the costs related to the refinery logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here has been adjusted for the dropdown completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance, adjusted for the drop impacts, on the going-forward basis. While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter, we expect a net increase of approximately $230 million, resulting from today's dropdown, which includes the fees paid to MPLX for 2 of the 3 months of the first quarter.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017, as we expect sour crude runs to be impacted by planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast. The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items, which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increases in unallocated corporate costs and employee-related expenses, are projected to be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee-related expenses specific to the first quarter.
Additionally, we will be updating MPC's R&M segment price and margin sensitivities in the appendix on Slide 21.

We too believe that there's significant upside opportunity with IMO, not only in the incremental projects, but on our base business, but we have not taken any of that upside into the IRR calculations on those projects. But when we finish, we're going to be able to destroy approximately -- probably somewhere between 280,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of resid. And on a total-refining-system basis, we're going to be up significantly over 700,000 barrels per day of annual distillate production. So both the resid destruction, our total annual distillate production, we have the ability to swing then between gasoline and distillate when this is complete. And we've always said around 8% to 10%. We'll probably be a little bit higher when we get these projects complete. But high returns and I think significant upside if the market continues to perform like many of us think it will."

At our Galveston Bay refinery, we talked, over the years, about the STAR project, which fits right in with IMO. It's a resid destruction, it's a diesel maximization project. That project has actually had a stage implementation going back to couple of years, and we'll have stage implementation going forward, all the way out to when it finally completes, so it will be Q1 2022. But ahead of IMO, there will be some more implementation there. To follow up with your other comment about additional projects, in addition to the CapEx for R&M, we always have the backlog of projects that we are doing some level of engineering, and we have some very attractive projects in queue that we'll continue to reevaluate, given the current market look and, potentially, bring some more of those projects forward."

If you look since the beginning of MPC and, specifically, in 2017, very, very strong returns to shareholders both in dividends and in share buybacks. You will continue to see, as Tim just highlighted, a significant amount of the after-tax proceeds that we received from these drops, is going to be available for capital return to shareholders. Beyond that, we see some very strong opportunities. Kristina's first question of the day, very strong opportunities in the refining side, mainly around distillate production in our refineries. And let me ask Mike here to talk about what he's seeing in the Midstream side."

We're also going to add a fractionator up in the Marcellus area. We're going to add 2 [ de-effenizers ] up in the Marcellus area, which I think is another opportunity that's starting to reveal itself by staying up in the Northeast. In addition to that, we're expanding our crude pipelines, Ozark up into the Midcontinent as well as Wood River over to Patoka as well. But we have a pretty full-plate execution, it will be a high priority for MPLX in 2018 as far as the identified capital. And then we have a couple of other opportunities that we're working on that will give us some more diversified cash flows.

And then we had it across the entire Ohio Valley. But we've had 2 to 3 major ice storms where things just were shut down. I think that proves out, if you look at this week's inventory numbers and the building of crude oil, it's just illustrative of the refineries not being able to run full-out. A number of refineries having temporary blips, mostly due to power outage. But all this kind of works together. So I think it is a very temporary thing. The other thing that Tony can speak to is we've had a very swift rising crude price. And you have to be able to get that price to the Street.

Well, from a macro standpoint, Neil, if you look at the crude inventories, very much in line and looking at just over the last 3 years, a significant, I would say, rebalancing of crude oil across the entire system. So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year. And since your conference, I'm even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the foreign producers are continuing to, I think, be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market. And I think, on the U.S. production side, there's a very strong view of a -- that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you're going to see, probably, we'll get north of $70 this year on the crude price, which I think bodes well for the total utilization of refineries. I think it bodes well for the drill bit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from a macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price, you have to get that price to the Street. Going to have to get to the wholesale level as well as the retail level. However, inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think you're -- we're going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and -- we already know some that are scheduled here in PADD II earlier in the year than you would anticipate. And I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system. Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market."

I'm just wondering if you -- how much you thought about the scenarios as to how this could ultimately play out in a, let's say, a $70 oil world, which, I guess, also changes the economics for shipping decisions as it always discovers and so on.

One of the things that you have to look at in Europe and starting in the U.K., it's going to happen to other countries in Europe as well. But they're going to become more of a sponge for gasoline going forward. As you know, it's always been historically that they push diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are -- have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline. And the other thing is, our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports, whether it's to Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios, and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are -- I only speak for MPC, we are very, very well-positioned before this IMO change is coming. And if gasoline continues to pick up, that's why we're investing in further distribution capabilities, both at Galveston Bay and Garyville, to be able to take bigger cargoes of gasoline."

First of all, let me remind you, the comps you're looking at, when you mentioned the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember, we formed this joint venture with Pilot. So we moved sales, margin, expenses out of the detailed categories into an equity earnings components. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point's correct. There is some softness in what we look at as transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those are all -- and actually the priorities in some of the growth areas in some of the store, that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier, will be around some high-growth areas like food service, for example, in convenience stores. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about. As far as the newbuilds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be, and we've consistently said this, we're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean, that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years, and we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC's supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our Eastern markets, those are really good MPC supply areas and, therefore, we want to take advantage of those synergies by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply. And the last point on acquisitions, we don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole, my observation would be is that it's consolidating, their needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenience store industry. So I think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint."

We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.This morning, we reported",1386,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. We issued 2 press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcement and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.
This morning, we reported strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved record full year performance along with the substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will ask Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results shortly.
Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 significant 5-year milestones for our company. February marks the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishments since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence, all while achieving lower operating expenses. For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%; achieved numerous processing records, including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone; and cut unplanned downtime in half. We have also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%.
It has also been 5 years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders, representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation. The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into the Midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced the strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors, which we completed today.
As part of the strategic actions, we executed dropdowns through MPLX of assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA, adding high-quality fee-based revenue streams to MPLX and further diversifying the partnership's earnings. Following the dropdowns, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear valuation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This, combined with elimination of the partnership's IDR burden, creates mutual benefits and positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all its unitholders, including MPC.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to see Standard & Poor's recognize MPLX's transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rating to BBB flat.
Looking forward, this morning, we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin-enhancing projects, as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses, especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018, excluding MPLX, is $1.6 billion. This planned spending includes $950 million for Refining & Marketing, $530 million for Speedway and $100 million to support corporate activities and other investments. The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately $400 million of growth capital, focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher-value products, maximizing distillate production and expanding life product placement flexibility, including exports.
With the investments we've made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low-sulfur international bunker fuels requirement in 2020, commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has deep conversion capacity as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low-sulfur diesel and resid upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments, which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery, which we referred to as the STAR project; the diesel maximization project at Garyville; and the Garyville coker expansion.
We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build upon its industry-leading position. This significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations.
MPLX also announced its capital investment plan for 2018, including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately $190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes the addition of 8 processing plants, representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity, as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins.
The remaining growth capital of the partnership is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined products infrastructure, including export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery. As we start the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018.
From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by a more balanced supply-and-demand environment, which should be supportive of crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think this creates a very productive backdrop for refining margins, in addition to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. 
Inventories were more balanced than they have been for several years. On the days of supply basis, including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006. And U.S. distillate inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone.
From a crude-differential perspective, we expect the Brent-WTI spread to be volatile, but to generally trade a couple of dollars on either side of $5 per barrel. This is based on our view that pipelines from Cushing to the Gulf will be relatively full and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials, although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events.
We also expect favorable Canadian crude-oil differentials, both heavy and light, over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines in the U.S. will be full, and incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have to clear by rail. This should keep heavy differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017.
We also believe that global and U.S. macro picture remains solid, and expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continues to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities at both Galveston Bay and Garyville.
In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is the recent tax reform legislation. The reduction in the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in cash burden on MPC and our high confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business help support our board's decision to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week.
During the quarter, we returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including the $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from the dropdown transactions completed during the year.
Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, $3.7 billion of that $13 billion was in the form of regularly -- of regular quarterly dividends, which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company. Return of capital to shareholders and attend to long-term investments in the business and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors.
As I wrap up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of report -- of a report, called Perspectives, on climate-related scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate-related strategies, risk and opportunities, using the framework recommended by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The report has been very well-received by investors and is pointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and the welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC.
With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?"

Turning to Slide 4. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion",388,"Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 4. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform.
The Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record-setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization.
After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector, with a very competitive cost of capital going forward. Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well-positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for its unitholders, including MPC. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear additional color on the partnership's performance and opportunities.
Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same-store merchandise sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA, reinforcing the strategic value of this high-performing, stable cash flow business.
Turning to Refining & Marketing. We delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year, and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system.
Additionally, we achieved numerous monthly process unit and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017, including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distillate production. As a result, we are now the second largest refiner in the U.S. on a crude-throughput basis, and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second- and third-largest refineries, respectively.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year."
118315802,548808304,1379453,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $22",2125,"Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share. For the full year, earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016. As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, as a result of remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform, the walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and high utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices using the benchmark crack spread.
Speedway's fourth quarter results were generally comparable to last year. The increase in life product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin in the quarter. The $47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Earlier results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the negative variance on noncontrolling interest.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $586 million favorable impact to the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.08 -- to $11.08 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread to $9.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year.
The Light Louisiana Sweet and Texas intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up from $1.30 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. These benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there is an offset in the product portion of other margin. As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor, which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the strong cracks was $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations was at $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an ex-RIN basis, with higher LLS crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blended crack spreads for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017.
The LLS-WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by 3 factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance in other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and nontransportation fuel product price realizations versus spot prices used in the LLS-based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery volumetric gain due to higher refined products price environment and increased crude-throughput volumes in 2017.
A narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the prompt crude prices used in the benchmark crack to actual crude acquisition cost. This walk also reflects an unfavorable $345 million due to the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year results are affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway share of the results of operations is reflected as income from the equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories.
Speedway segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. These impacts were partially offset by higher light product margin, which increased to $17.72 per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from $16.17 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the LCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase in full year segment income, excluding the LCM benefit, was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year.
In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedway same-store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices have moved higher and impacts from severe winter weather. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid, and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018.
Slide 10 provides changes in the Midstream segment income, highlighting the $47 million quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to increase in contributions from MPLX. MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets in 2017. As Don referenced earlier, a more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the MPLX earnings call beginning at 11:00 a.m., and we encourage you to listen in.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase of approximately $923 million from the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow, before changes of working capital, was an approximately $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net debt was a $73 million source of cash, which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders, by a way of share repurchases and dividends, totaled $945 million in the quarter, including $750 million of share repurchases, at a weighted average share price of $57.90. As Gary mentioned, that on Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividends since becoming an independent company 6 years ago. This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long-term cash generation of the business.
Since the beginning of the year, we've returned over $3 billion of capital to MPC shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which were supported in part by proceeds from dropdown transactions during the year. Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after-tax proceeds from today's dropdown transaction, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. We had nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represents 2.2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or about 1.4x excluding MPLX. This same metric, including distributions to MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA, was 1.3x. We believe the addition of the distributions from MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities, given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous dropdowns, the intersegment earnings, associated with the dropdown, will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results, and as such, prior period results will remain in the R&M segment. Importantly, the dropdown of earnings into the Midstream segment will not cause any change to R&M margin. Direct operating cost will no longer include costs related to the refinery -- refining logistics assets and the MPLX fees to manage the refining logistics assets as well as to provide fuels distribution services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses. We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expenses of approximately $1 billion, with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment.
For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volumes statistic related to the fuels distribution services, although volume risks to the partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-services contract that underlies the arrangement.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day, with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.90 per barrel. As I mentioned on the prior slide, direct operating cost will exclude the costs related to the refinery logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here has been adjusted for the dropdown completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance, adjusted for the drop impacts, on the going-forward basis. While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter, we expect a net increase of approximately $230 million, resulting from today's dropdown, which includes the fees paid to MPLX for 2 of the 3 months of the first quarter.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017, as we expect sour crude runs to be impacted by planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast. The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items, which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increases in unallocated corporate costs and employee-related expenses, are projected to be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee-related expenses specific to the first quarter.
Additionally, we will be updating MPC's R&M segment price and margin sensitivities in the appendix on Slide 21.

We too believe that there's significant upside opportunity with IMO, not only in the incremental projects, but on our base business, but we have not taken any of that upside into the IRR calculations on those projects. But when we finish, we're going to be able to destroy approximately -- probably somewhere between 280,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of resid. And on a total-refining-system basis, we're going to be up significantly over 700,000 barrels per day of annual distillate production. So both the resid destruction, our total annual distillate production, we have the ability to swing then between gasoline and distillate when this is complete. And we've always said around 8% to 10%.

In '17, we finished a part of the STAR project, which took us from up to about 252,000 barrels per day, and the balance will take us up to this 280,000 to 300,000, and then that's the resid destruction. And then in distillate production, in '17, we were about 640,000, and we're going to go up to about 710,000, 720,000, when we complete these projects.

So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year. And since your conference, I'm even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the foreign producers are continuing to, I think, be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market. And I think, on the U.S. production side, there's a very strong view of a -- that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you're going to see, probably, we'll get north of $70 this year on the crude price, which I think bodes well for the total utilization of refineries. I think it bodes well for the drill bit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from a macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price, you have to get that price to the Street. Going to have to get to the wholesale level as well as the retail level. However, inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think you're -- we're going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and -- we already know some that are scheduled here in PADD II earlier in the year than you would anticipate. And I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system. Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market."

And one of the things we're kind of thinking is that there are still some regions of the world that have very low utilization rates. And if diesel margins really improve as much as some folks think they could, my concern, I guess, is that we see a step-up in utilization, for example, in Europe to at the expense of gasoline supply in the Atlantic basin, meaning, we end up oversupplying the gasoline market.  I'm just wondering if you -- how much you thought about the scenarios as to how this could ultimately play out in a, let's say, a $70 oil world, which, I guess, also changes the economics for shipping decisions as it always discovers and so on.

One of the things that you have to look at in Europe and starting in the U.K., it's going to happen to other countries in Europe as well. But they're going to become more of a sponge for gasoline going forward. As you know, it's always been historically that they push diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are -- have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline. And the other thing is, our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports, whether it's to Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios, and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are -- I only speak for MPC, we are very, very well-positioned before this IMO change is coming. And if gasoline continues to pick up, that's why we're investing in further distribution capabilities, both at Galveston Bay and Garyville, to be able to take bigger cargoes of gasoline."

First of all, let me remind you, the comps you're looking at, when you mentioned the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember, we formed this joint venture with Pilot. So we moved sales, margin, expenses out of the detailed categories into an equity earnings components. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point's correct. There is some softness in what we look at as transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those are all -- and actually the priorities in some of the growth areas in some of the store, that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier, will be around some high-growth areas like food service, for example, in convenience stores. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about. As far as the newbuilds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be, and we've consistently said this, we're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean, that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years, and we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC's supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our Eastern markets, those are really good MPC supply areas and, therefore, we want to take advantage of those synergies by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply. And the last point on acquisitions, we don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole, my observation would be is that it's consolidating, their needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenience store industry. So I think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint."

Earlier today, we reported an outstanding second quarter. Our income from operations was $1.7 billion, and we are pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the highest quarter since MPC became a public company in 2011. The commodity environment and markets in which we operate were volatile this quarter, but our diversified integrated business model created opportunities and our team executed in capturing those opportunities, which drove these extraordinary results.
We often talked about commitment to crating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and this quarter was no different. We maintained our focus on operational excellence as well as our disciplined capital strategy, which enabled return of capital beyond the needs of our business. This quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders, including $885 million of share repurchases.
As we look to the second half of 2018, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our business. Global demand remained strong and inventory levels were moderate despite recently high refining utilization levels across the U.S. Additionally, crude differentials appeared sustainably wider in many of our markets. In particular, as we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-linked crude. The WCS market continues to face logistical constraints relative to production growth, which we believe should support attractive differentials for our system to capture.
We continue to optimize our exports at Galveston Bay and Garyville with the objective of maximizing profitability, and we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of a the [ low ] sulfur international bunker fuel regulations in 2020 given the [indiscernible] upgrading we have made in our business over the last decade.
At the same time, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the combination of Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor into a premier nationwide integrated downstream energy company. There are tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses, which will be well positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. This combination is expected to generate at least $1 billion of tangible and gross run rate synergies within the first 3 years, which is anticipated to drive more than $5 billion of incremental cash generation over the first 5 years alone.
Our team has made significant progress towards completing the combination. We recently announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and have continued to advance necessary SEC filings, including filing a second amendment to our form S-4 on July 20, to proceed towards shareholder votes. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2018.
We believe MPC is supported by this great combination with Andeavor absolutely becomes a must-own refining, marketing and midstream company.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the second quarter and an update on the integration process.

Reported second quarter earnings of $1.06 billion and income from operations of $1.71 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with second quarter segment earnings of $1.03 billion, an increase of nearly $463 million over second quarter of 2017. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter with record throughput volumes and we were able to capture wider grew differentials across our system.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $617 million and achieved record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughputs. Our Midstream operations continue to grow, given both the robust organic growth investments as well as improved utilization of existing assets.
While dialogues with investors seemed to focus more on one basin versus another, we continue to be encouraged by the growth prospects across all of the regions in which we operate and in particular by the continued growth prospects in both the Northeast and the Permian. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $159 million. In the second quarter, gasoline and distillate margins were adversely impacted by the overall rise in crude oil. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
We are optimistic about the second half of the year for Speedway as we are expecting to close on the acquisition of 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York in the third quarter. These stores will enhance our existing network and expand our brand presence in key growth markets.
The completion of the pending Andeavor combination will add store location to Speedway's marketing territory, establishing a coast-to-coast presence. With its industry-leading retail position and loyalty program, Speedway is well situated to expand over this nationwide footprint.
As Gary mentioned, we made significant progress on our proposed transactions from a regulatory standpoint. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our integration planning. Since we announced this transaction about 12 weeks ago, we've been focused on day 1. Our combined teams have worked diligently to identify key best practices across our organization with the goal of developing a bottoms-up plan to achieve our $1 billion annual run rate gross synergy target. We are currently ahead of our baseline integration plan and expect to be ready to go at close.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the second quarter."

Slide 6 provides earnings in both absolute and per share basis.

Slide 6 provides earnings in both absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we're in last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing and is compared to the second quarter of 2017. The $463 million favorable variance was driven by positive Midwestern and Gulf Coast crack spreads as well as wider WCS and WTI-based grew differentials.
Speedway second quarter results were lower than second quarter last year by $79 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. The $285 million favorable Midstream variance was primary due to the recent drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as record gathered, process and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes. The favorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments include the absence of $886 million of litigation-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2017, offset by approximately $10 million of transactions costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the pending combination with Andeavor.
The higher earnings in MPLX, which includes the impact of the drop resulted in $89 million of increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of just over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $562 million in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had a $243 million favorable variance -- favorable impact to segment results largely due to lower RIN prices and the resulting higher effective crack. The LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads was [ $6.98 ] per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to [ $5.71 ] per barrel in the second quarter 2017.
Our ability to take advantage of grew differentials provided substantial benefits from the quarter. The widening sweet-sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $320 million versus last year. The differential increased to [ $9.46 ] per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 from [ $5.48 ] per barrel in 2017. The LLS-WTI differential increased to [ $5.12 ] per barrel, up from [ 2 0 3 ] per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove a $180 million benefit based from the WTI-linked crudes in our sleep.
The favorable crude acquisition impacts were approximately $173 million captured in other margin were accentuated by a refinery utilization rate of 99.9% for the quarter, which resulted in a record crude oil throughput of 1.9 million barrels per day as well as strong volumetric gains in the higher pricing environment.
Direct operating cost had a favorable impact of $76 million to segment earnings mainly due to the absence of costs related to the refining logistics assets that were dropped to MPLX in February 1 and are now reported in the Midstream segment. These benefits were offset by several factors including the $219 million unfavorable variance and the product component of other margin, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations were spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Also offsetting the benefits was a $385 million unfavorable variance and other R&M expenses primarily due to fee-based epaulets related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period earn-out results were not adjusted to reflect this newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments, Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. Segment income from operations was $159 million, down $79 million from the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in segment results was primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to  [ $16.45 ] per gallon in the second quarter of 2018 compared to [ $18.35 ] per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Operating expenses increased $24 million year-over-year due mainly to higher labor and benefit cost, while the depreciation was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investment in the business. The $6 million gain on sale of assets recorded in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed to the difference from the second quarter last year. 
In July, merchandise sales has started off strong. We've seen a 5.5% increase in same-store merchandise sales compared to last July, while same-store gasoline sales volumes have decreased about 1.8%.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the second quarter. Segment income was $617 million in the second quarter 2018 compared to $332 million in the same period 2017. The $328 million variance for MPLX was favorably impacted by $232 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of improvements related to record, gathered and processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughput volumes. As Don mentioned, we encourage you to look at the MPLX earnings release and join the update call at 11 to get more color on the partnerships great performance in the second quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, an increase of approximately $346 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.8 billion source from the quarter.
Working capital was a $544 million source of cash as higher crude and other payables more than offset a modest inventory build and an increase of receivables for crude oil and refined products in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, included $885 million of share repurchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $17 billion in total consolidated debt, including nearly $12 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.6x the last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.2x EBITDA excluding the data and EBITDA of MPLX. Taking into account the distributions MPC received from MPLX, this same parent level was 1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We believe this parent level, including MPLX distributions look, is a more useful way to look at MPC's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance of stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. This year and over time, the growing MPLX distribution will provide substantial funding to MPC and will continue to be a fundamental component of APCs discretionary free cash flow.
Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2018. We're expecting total throughput volumes of approximately 2 million barrels per day, with planned maintenance currently taking place at our refinery and downtime scheduled for Detroit refinery in September.
Total direct operating cost are expected to be $7 per barrel. As a reminder, total direct operating cost now reflect the reduction of costs associated with the drops. We expect the net cost related to MPLX fees reflected in the other column of the R&M walk to be approximately $340 million per quarter on a going-forward basis.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 53% of our crude oil throughput for the third quarter, and WTI crude estimated to be about 32% of the [ slide ]. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $85 million and any transactions costs related with the Andeavor combination.

We're having to move hourly rates up in order to track that labor. And I think to your question, I think what we're focused on is, we look at a number of technology investments that we're making, both outside and inside our store, to become more efficient so we can reduce the labor cost or control the labor cost at a point where we're competitive in that regard. And the other factor that's pushing the labor cost too is, we continue to add stores to our portfolio. So in the second quarter alone, we added 15 net stores. So that's net of both the new and rebuilds less the closed store locations. So there's more stores in our portfolio. And then we're also adding more complex stores as we spend money on remodels.

It will take some time, but that is one of the key synergies and I think key operating efficiencies that were going to be able to really transfer into those stores. That model or that platform that Speedway has, it manages all inventory. And if you have a technology that can manage inventory, you don't need people counting things. But it manages all inventory in and out of the store, it manages labor, it manages day parts of labor requirements in the store to hit peak periods.

Earlier today, we reported an outstanding second quarter. Our income from operations was $1.7 billion, and we're pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the highest quarter since MPC became a public company in 2011. The commodity environment and markets in which we operate were volatile this quarter, but our diversified integrated business model created opportunities and our team executed in capturing those opportunities, which drove these extraordinary results.
We often talk about our commitment to creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and this quarter was no different. We maintained our focus on operational excellence as well as our disciplined capital strategy, which enabled return of capital beyond the needs of our business. This quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders, including $885 million of share repurchases.
As we look to the second half of 2018, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our business. Global demand remained strong and inventory levels were moderate despite recently high refining utilization levels across the U.S. Additionally, crude differentials appeared sustainably wider in many of our markets. In particular, as we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-linked crude. The WCS market continues to face logistical constraints relative to production growth, which we believe should support attractive differentials for our system to capture.
We continue to optimize our exports at Galveston Bay and Garyville with the objective of maximizing profitability, and we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low sulfur international bunker fuel regulations in 2020 given the resid upgrading investments we have made in our business over the last decade.
At the same time, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the combination of Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor into a premier nationwide integrated downstream energy company. There are tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses, which will be well positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. This combination is expected to generate at least $1 billion of tangible annual gross run-rate synergies within the first 3 years, which is anticipated to drive more than $5 billion of incremental cash generation over the first 5 years alone.
Our team has made significant progress towards completing the combination. We recently announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and have continued to advance necessary SEC filings, including filing a second amendment to our form S-4 on July 20, to proceed towards shareholder votes. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2018.
We believe MPC is supported by this great combination with Andeavor absolutely becomes a must-own refining, marketing and midstream company.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the second quarter and an update on the integration process.

We reported second quarter earnings of $1.06 billion and income from operations of $1.71 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with second quarter segment earnings of $1.03 billion, an increase of nearly $463 million over second quarter of 2017. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter with record throughput volumes and we were able to capture wider crude differentials across our system.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $617 million and achieved record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughputs. Our Midstream operations continue to grow, given both the robust organic growth investments as well as improved utilization of existing assets.
While dialogues with investors seemed to focus more on one basin versus another, we continue to be encouraged by the growth prospects across all of the regions in which we operate and in particular by the continued growth prospects in both the Northeast and the Permian. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $159 million. In the second quarter, gasoline and distillate margins were adversely impacted by the overall rise in crude oil. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
We are optimistic about the second half of the year for Speedway as we are expecting to close on the acquisition of 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York in the third quarter. These stores will enhance our existing network and expand our brand presence in key growth markets.
The completion of the pending Andeavor combination will add store location to Speedway's marketing territory, establishing our coast-to-coast presence. With its industry-leading retail position and loyalty program, Speedway is well situated to expand over this nationwide footprint.
As Gary mentioned, we made significant progress on our proposed transactions from a regulatory standpoint. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our integration planning. Since we announced this transaction about 12 weeks ago, we've been focused on day 1. Our combined teams have worked diligently to identify key best practices across our organization with the goal of developing a bottoms-up plan to achieve our $1 billion annual run rate gross synergy target. We are currently ahead of our baseline integration plan and expect to be ready to go at close.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the second quarter."
118315802,573241899,1509636,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we're in last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the",1351,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we're in last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing and is compared to the second quarter of 2017. The $463 million favorable variance was driven by positive Midwestern and Gulf Coast crack spreads as well as wider WCS and WTI-based crude differentials.
Speedway second quarter results were lower than second quarter last year by $79 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. The $285 million favorable Midstream variance was primary due to the recent drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as record gathered, process and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes. The favorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments include the absence of $886 million of litigation-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2017, offset by approximately $10 million of transactions costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the pending combination with Andeavor.
The higher earnings in MPLX, which includes the impact of the survey drop resulted in $89 million of increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of just over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $562 million in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had a $243 million favorable variance -- favorable impact to segment results largely due to lower RIN prices and the resulting higher effective crack. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spreads was $6.98 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $5.71 per barrel in the second quarter 2017.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits from the quarter. The widening sweet-sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $320 million versus last year. The differential increased to $9.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 from $5.48 per barrel in 2017. The LLS-WTI differential increased to $5.12 per barrel, up from $2.03 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove a $180 million benefit based from the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.
The favorable crude acquisition impacts were approximately $173 million captured in other margin were accentuated by a refinery utilization rate of 99.9% for the quarter, which resulted in a record crude oil throughput of 1.9 million barrels per day as well as strong volumetric gains in the higher pricing environment.
Direct operating cost had a favorable impact of $76 million to segment earnings mainly due to the absence of costs related to the refining logistics assets that were dropped to MPLX in February 1 and are now reported in the Midstream segment. These benefits were offset by several factors including the $219 million unfavorable variance and the product component of other margin, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Also offsetting the benefits was a $385 million unfavorable variance and other R&M expenses primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments, Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. Segment income from operations was $159 million, down $79 million from the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in segment results was primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.1645 per gallon in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the $0.1835 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Operating expenses increased $24 million year-over-year due mainly to higher labor and benefit cost, while depreciation was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investment in the business. The $6 million gain on sale of assets recorded in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed to the difference from the second quarter last year. 
In July, merchandise sales has started off strong. We've seen a 5.5% increase in same-store merchandise sales compared to last July, while same-store gasoline sales volumes have decreased about 1.8%.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the second quarter. Segment income was $617 million in the second quarter 2018 compared to $332 million in the same period 2017. The $328 million variance for MPLX was favorably impacted by $232 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to record, gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughput volumes. 
As Don mentioned, we'd encourage you to look at the MPLX earnings release and join the update call at 11 to get more color on the partnership's great performance in the second quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes on our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, an increase of approximately $346 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.8 billion source from the quarter.
Working capital was a $544 million source of cash as higher crude and other payables more than offset a modest inventory build and an increase in receivables from crude oil and refined products in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, included $885 million of share repurchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $17 billion in total consolidated debt, including nearly $12 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.6x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.2x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Taking into account the distributions MPC received from MPLX, this same parent level was 1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We believe this parent level, including MPLX distributions look, is a more useful way to look at MPC's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. This year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will continue to be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2018. We're expecting total throughput volumes of approximately 2 million barrels per day, with planned maintenance currently taking place at our Canton Refinery and downtime scheduled for Detroit in -- for the [indiscernible] refinery in September.
Total direct operating cost are expected to be $7 per barrel. As a reminder, total direct operating cost now reflect the reduction of costs associated with the drops. We expect the net cost related to MPLX fees reflected in the other column of the R&M walk to be approximately $340 million per quarter on a going-forward basis.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 53% of our crude oil throughput for the third quarter, and WTI-priced crude is estimated to be about 32%, on the slide. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $85 million, prior to any transactions costs related with the Andeavor combination.

And when you take the most conservative projection in the document and you add in likely merger cost and benefit, it appears that the combined company has an earnings outlook that's way above the consensus even though you appear to be using margin projections that are both flat or close to flat and well below the forward curve during '18 to '21.

And either way, was there a reason that they're conservative, at least, in relation to the forward curve given the fundamental and IMO 2020 outlook? So 2 different questions about the S-4 information."

And recall, the S-4 is not for guidance, it's really for our business plan, budgeting purposes and, yes, that is -- those are the numbers that we used in determining the value of the 2 companies and for the fairness opinion. So but you know what's -- you know our company very well, we've always been very conservative in how we look at things into the future. And it does not necessarily mean that, that is the value that we see, and with the IMO coming on and even with some upside potential in crack spreads. So this is not meant for guidance, this was meant to value the 2 companies. And I would say that based on our outlook -- and the other thing, Doug, is, as you look right now at inventories across the globe, we believe that inventories are very good shape across the entire globe. And I believe that, that's going to lead to upside potential as we get into the third quarter here. And as we then embark on 2019, which we would think as where we're really going to start to see the upswing in the IMO effect. So those are not for guidance, those were for valuation purposes. And of course, in December, we're going to have a big analyst meeting and we'll get more granular at that time."

But when markets are volatile, if you operate well, have strong operational excellence programs, you can capture the optionality that's available in the marketplace as we just highlighted in the numbers that Tim went over. So no, it doesn't change our outlook at all. California is going to have, as I would say, in England, swings and roundabouts, and it'll continue to have that. But we expect that. Of course, El Paso, Salt Lake, as you said, the Midcontinent continues to be strong, and we would expect that to continue. But going back and looking at the integration, and as Don reviewed, I would say we have the bit in our mouth and we're ready to go with this integration. We have the HSR approval way into finalize the S-4. And -- but I've not seen any negatives, I've only seen positives.

So again that authorization was one that we pursued as the board around the time of the announcement just -- frankly, because we know that once this business come together, as Don referenced, and I think we're continuing to feel very good about the incremental cash generation from the combination is going to be substantial. And so I think a big source of where that cash is going to go is likely going to be back to shareholders and likely in the form of share repurchase. So I think our approach from here forward, frankly, is going to remain consistent. There is -- there will be a period of time, I think, during the solicitation period, will be precluded from that activity, but I'd call that a blip in the road as opposed to any sort of structural change.

One is the wage inflation that we're experiencing as a result of the low unemployment rates that we're seeing in the country now, and that's just putting competition for that labor at the store level for us. We're having to move hourly rates up in order to track that labor. And I think to your question, I think what we're focused on is, we look at a number of technology investments that we're making, both outside and inside our store, to become more efficient so we can reduce the labor cost or control the labor cost to the point where we're competitive in that regard. And the other factor that's pushing the labor cost too is, we continue to add stores to our portfolio. So in the second quarter alone, we added 15 net stores. So that's net of both the new and rebuilds less the closed store locations. So there's more stores in our portfolio. And then we're also adding more complex stores as we spend money on remodels.

That model or that platform that Speedway has, it manages all inventory. And if you have a technology that can manage inventory, you don't need people counting things. But it manages all inventory in and out of the store, it manages labor, it manages day parts of labor requirements in the store to hit your peak periods.

If you look at our synergy capture and we were targeting roughly $0.5 billion in year 1 and that escalates or grows into $1 billion run rate in year 3. So in year 1, if you looked at sort of the components of the synergies that we are anticipating to achieve, a number of them are around cost synergies and synergies around our sourcing and procurement activities. In the back-end of the synergies are typically things related to refining and systems, optimizing our system and also optimizing kind of a ramped-in approach around our retail business. So those capital expenditures are very much tailored to the type of synergy that we're expecting to capture. Cost and optimizations sort of are in year 1, and enhancements to the asset base and that we have as we go on in the year 2 and 3."

Our income from operations was $1.7 billion, and we're pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the h",485,"Thanks, Kristina, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
Earlier today, we reported an outstanding second quarter. Our income from operations was $1.7 billion, and we're pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the highest quarter since MPC became a public company in 2011. The commodity environment and markets in which we operate were volatile this quarter, but our diversified integrated business model created opportunities and our team executed in capturing those opportunities, which drove these extraordinary results.
We often talk about our commitment to creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and this quarter was no different. We maintained our focus on operational excellence as well as our disciplined capital strategy, which enabled return of capital beyond the needs of our business. This quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders, including $885 million of share repurchases.
As we look to the second half of 2018, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our business. Global demand remained strong and inventory levels were moderate despite recently high refining utilization levels across the U.S. Additionally, crude differentials appeared sustainably wider in many of our markets. In particular, as we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-linked crude. The WCS market continues to face logistical constraints relative to production growth, which we believe should support attractive differentials for our system to capture.
We continue to optimize our exports at Galveston Bay and Garyville with the objective of maximizing profitability, and we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low sulfur international bunker fuel regulations in 2020 given the resid upgrading investments we have made in our business over the last decade.
At the same time, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the combination of Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor into a premier nationwide integrated downstream energy company. There are tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses, which will be well positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. This combination is expected to generate at least $1 billion of tangible annual gross run-rate synergies within the first 3 years, which is anticipated to drive more than $5 billion of incremental cash generation over the first 5 years alone.
Our team has made significant progress towards completing the combination. We recently announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and have continued to advance the necessary SEC filings, including filing a second amendment to our form S-4 on July 20, to proceed towards shareholder votes. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2018.
We believe MPC as supported by this great combination with Andeavor absolutely becomes a must-own refining, marketing and midstream company.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the second quarter and an update on the integration process.

We reported second quarter earnings of $1.06 billion and income from operations of $1.71 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with second quarter segment earnings of $1.03 billion, an increase of nearly $463 million over second quarter of 2017. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter with record throughput volumes and we were able to capture wider crude differentials across our system.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $617 million and achieved record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughputs. Our Midstream operations continue to grow, given both the robust organic growth investments as well as improved utilization of existing assets.
While dialogues with investors seemed to focus more on one basin versus another, we continue to be encouraged by the growth prospects across all of the regions in which we operate and in particular by the continued growth prospects in both the Northeast and the Permian. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $159 million. In the second quarter, gasoline and distillate margins were adversely impacted by the overall rise in crude oil. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
We are optimistic about the second half of the year for Speedway as we are expecting to close on the acquisition of 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York in the third quarter. These stores will enhance our existing network and expand our brand presence in key growth markets.
The completion of the pending Andeavor combination will add store location to Speedway's marketing territory, establishing our coast-to-coast presence. With its industry-leading retail position and loyalty program, Speedway is well situated to expand over this nationwide footprint.
As Gary mentioned, we made significant progress on our proposed transactions from a regulatory standpoint. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our integration planning. Since we announced this transaction about 12 weeks ago, we've been focused on day 1. Our combined teams have worked diligently to identify key best practices across our organization with the goal of developing a bottoms-up plan to achieve our $1 billion annual run rate gross synergy target. We are currently ahead of our baseline integration plan and expect to be ready to go at close.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the second quarter."

Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we earned last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows th",1350,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we earned last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing earnings compared to the second quarter of 2017. The $463 million favorable variance was driven by positive Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads as well as wider WCS and WTI-based crude differentials.
Speedway second quarter results were lower than second quarter last year by $79 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. The $285 million favorable Midstream variance was primary due to the recent drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as record gathered, process and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes. The favorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments include the absence of $886 million of litigation-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2017, offset by approximately $10 million of transactions costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the pending combination with Andeavor.
The higher earnings in MPLX, which includes the impact of the survey drop resulted in $89 million of increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of just over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $562 million in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had a $243 million favorable variance -- favorable impact to segment results largely due to lower RIN prices and the resulting higher effective crack. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $6.98 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $5.71 per barrel in the second quarter 2017.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet-sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $320 million versus last year. The differential increased to $9.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 from $5.48 per barrel in 2017. The LLS-WTI differential increased to $5.12 per barrel, up from $2.03 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove a $180 million benefit based from the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.
The favorable crude acquisition impacts were approximately $173 million captured in other margin were accentuated by a refinery utilization rate of 99.9% for the quarter, which resulted in a record crude oil throughput of 1.9 million barrels per day as well as strong volumetric gains in the higher pricing environment.
Direct operating cost had a favorable impact of $76 million to segment earnings mainly due to the absence of costs related to the refining logistics assets that were dropped to MPLX in February 1 and are now reported in the Midstream segment. These benefits were offset by several factors including the $219 million unfavorable variance and the product component of other margin, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Also offsetting the benefits was a $385 million unfavorable variance and other R&M expenses primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments, Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. Segment income from operations was $159 million, down $79 million from the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in segment results was primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.1645 per gallon in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the $0.1835 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Operating expenses increased $24 million year-over-year due mainly to higher labor and benefit cost, while depreciation was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investment in the business. The $6 million gain on sale of assets recorded in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed to the difference from the second quarter last year. 
In July, merchandise sales has started off strong. We've seen a 5.5% increase in same-store merchandise sales compared to last July, while same-store gasoline sales volumes have decreased about 1.8%.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the second quarter. Segment income was $617 million in the second quarter 2018 compared to $332 million in the same period 2017. The $328 million variance for MPLX was favorably impacted by $232 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to record, gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughput volumes. 
As Don mentioned, we'd encourage you to look at the MPLX earnings release and join the update call at 11 to get more color on the partnership's great performance in the second quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes on our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, an increase of approximately $346 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.8 billion source from the quarter.
Working capital was a $544 million source of cash as higher crude and other payables more than offset a modest inventory build and an increase in receivables from crude oil and refined products in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, included $885 million of share repurchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $17 billion in total consolidated debt, including nearly $12 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.6x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.2x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Taking into account the distributions MPC received from MPLX, this same parent level was 1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We believe this parent level, including MPLX distributions look, is a more useful way to look at MPC's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. This year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will continue to be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2018. We're expecting total throughput volumes of approximately 2 million barrels per day, with planned maintenance currently taking place at our Canton Refinery and downtime scheduled for Detroit in -- for the Detroit Refinery in September.
Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7 per barrel. As a reminder, total direct operating cost now reflect the reduction of costs associated with the drops. We expect the net cost related to MPLX fees reflected in the other column of the R&M walk to be approximately $340 million per quarter on a going-forward basis.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 53% of our crude oil throughput for the third quarter, and WTI-priced crude is estimated to be about 32%, of the slate. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $85 million, prior to any transactions costs related with the Andeavor combination.

And when you take the most conservative projection in the document and you add in likely merger cost and benefit, it appears that the combined company has an earnings outlook that's way above the consensus even though you appear to be using margin projections that are both flat or close to flat and well below the forward curve during '18 to '21. So my question's twofold: first, is my premise correct on the combined earnings outlook in relation to Street consensus? Or is there a more appropriate way to think about that information? And then second, can you confirm that the margin projections that are in the S-4 were utilized to reach those financial projections? And either way, was there a reason that they're conservative, at least, in relation to the forward curve given the fundamental and IMO 2020 outlook? So 2 different questions about the S-4 information."

And recall, the S-4 is not for guidance, it's really for our business plan, budgeting purposes and, yes, that is -- those are the numbers that we used in determining the value of the 2 companies and for the fairness opinion. So but you know what's -- you know our company very well, we've always been very conservative in how we look at things into the future. And it does not necessarily mean that, that is the value that we see, and with the IMO coming on and even with some upside potential in crack spreads. So this is not meant for guidance, this was meant to value the 2 companies. And I would say that based on our outlook -- and the other thing, Doug, is, as you look right now at inventories across the globe, we believe that inventories are in very good shape across the entire globe. And I believe that, that's going to lead to upside potential as we get into the third quarter here. And as we then embark on 2019, which we think as where we're really going to start to see the upswing in the IMO effect. So those are not for guidance, those were for valuation purposes.

But when markets are volatile, if you operate well, have strong operational excellence programs, you can capture the optionality that's available in the marketplace as we just highlighted in the numbers that Tim went over. So no, it doesn't change our outlook at all. California is going to have, as they would say, in England, swings and roundabouts, and it'll continue to have that. But we expect that. Of course, El Paso, Salt Lake, as you said, the Midcontinent continues to be strong, and we would expect that to continue. But going back and looking at the integration, and as Don reviewed, I would say we have the bit in our mouth and we're ready to go with this integration. We have the HSR approval,we're waiting to finalize the S-4. And -- but I've not seen any negatives, I've only seen positives. We still have to be very careful of front-running and you can't get too detailed until you get the final approvals. But what we have seen to date is very positive.

The authorization numbers that you cite I think might be a little bit stale. I think we're probably north of $5 billion of authorization from where we sit today, in fact may be closer to $6 billion. So again that authorization was one that we pursued at the board around the time of the announcement just -- frankly, because we know that once this business come together, as Don referenced, and I think we're continuing to feel very good about the incremental cash generation from the combination is going to be substantial. And so I think a big source of where that cash is going to go is likely going to be back to shareholders and likely in the form of share repurchase. So I think our approach from here forward, frankly, is going to remain consistent. There is -- there will be a period of time, I think, during the solicitation period, where we'll be precluded from that activity, but I'd call that a blip in the road as opposed to any sort of structural change. So I think you should expect to see our approach to be very consistent.

Yes, that is actually on the OpEx side, there's really 2 components in there. One is the wage inflation that we're experiencing as a result of the low unemployment rates that we're seeing in the country now, and that's just putting competition for that labor at the store level for us. We're having to move hourly rates up in order to attract that labor. And I think to your question, I think what we're focused on is, we look at a number of technology investments that we're making, both outside and inside our store, to become more efficient so we can reduce the labor cost or control the labor cost to the point where we're competitive in that regard. And the other factor that's pushing the labor cost too is, we continue to add stores to our portfolio. So in the second quarter alone, we added 15 net stores. So that's net of both the new and rebuilds less the closed store locations. So there's more stores in our portfolio. And then we're also adding more complex stores as we spend money on remodels.

It'll take some time, but that is one of the key synergies and, I think, key operating efficiencies that we're going to be able to really transfer into those stores. That model or that platform that Speedway has, it manages all inventory. And if you have a technology that can manage inventory, you don't need people counting things. But it manages all inventory in and out of the store, it manages labor, it manages day parts of labor requirements in the store to hit your peak periods.

Earlier today, we reported an outstanding second quarter. Our income from operations was $1.7 billion, and we're pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the highest quarter since MPC became a public company in 2011. The commodity environment and markets in which we operate were volatile this quarter, but our diversified integrated business model created opportunities and our team executed in capturing those opportunities, which drove these extraordinary results.
We often talk about our commitment to creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and this quarter was no different. We maintained our focus on operational excellence as well as our disciplined capital strategy, which enabled return of capital beyond the needs of our business. This quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders, including $885 million of share repurchases.
As we look to the second half of 2018, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our business. Global demand remained strong and inventory levels were moderate despite recently high refining utilization levels across the U.S. Additionally, crude differentials appeared sustainably wider in many of our markets. In particular, as we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-linked crude. The WCS market continues to face logistical constraints relative to production growth, which we believe should support attractive differentials for our system to capture.
We continue to optimize our exports at Galveston Bay and Garyville with the objective of maximizing profitability, and we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low sulfur international bunker fuel regulations in 2020 given the resid upgrading investments we have made in our business over the last decade.
At the same time, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the combination of Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor into a premier nationwide integrated downstream energy company. There are tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses, which will be well positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. This combination is expected to generate at least $1 billion of tangible annual gross run-rate synergies within the first 3 years, which is anticipated to drive more than $5 billion of incremental cash generation over the first 5 years alone.
Our team has made significant progress towards completing the combination. We recently announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and have continued to advance the necessary SEC filings, including filing a second amendment to our form S-4 on July 20, to proceed towards shareholder votes. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2018.
We believe MPC as supported by this great combination with Andeavor absolutely becomes a must-own refining, marketing and midstream company.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the second quarter and an update on the integration process.

We reported second quarter earnings of $1.06 billion and income from operations of $1.71 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with second quarter segment earnings of $1.03 billion, an increase of nearly $463 million over second quarter of 2017. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter with record throughput volumes and we were able to capture wider crude differentials across our system.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $617 million and achieved record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughputs. Our Midstream operations continue to grow, given both the robust organic growth investments as well as improved utilization of existing assets.
While dialogues with investors seemed to focus more on one basin versus another, we continue to be encouraged by the growth prospects across all of the regions in which we operate and in particular by the continued growth prospects in both the Northeast and the Permian. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $159 million. In the second quarter, gasoline and distillate margins were adversely impacted by the overall rise in crude oil. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
We are optimistic about the second half of the year for Speedway as we are expecting to close on the acquisition of 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York in the third quarter. These stores will enhance our existing network and expand our brand presence in key growth markets.
The completion of the pending Andeavor combination will add store location to Speedway's marketing territory, establishing our coast-to-coast presence. With its industry-leading retail position and loyalty program, Speedway is well situated to expand over this nationwide footprint.
As Gary mentioned, we made significant progress on our proposed transactions from a regulatory standpoint. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our integration planning. Since we announced this transaction about 12 weeks ago, we've been focused on day 1. Our combined teams have worked diligently to identify key best practices across our organization with the goal of developing a bottoms-up plan to achieve our $1 billion annual run rate gross synergy target. We are currently ahead of our baseline integration plan and expect to be ready to go at close.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the second quarter."

Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we earned last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows th",1350,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings in both in absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we earned last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing earnings compared to the second quarter of 2017. The $463 million favorable variance was driven by positive Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads as well as wider WCS and WTI-based crude differentials.
Speedway second quarter results were lower than second quarter last year by $79 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. The $285 million favorable Midstream variance was primary due to the recent drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as record gathered, process and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes. The favorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments include the absence of $886 million of litigation-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2017, offset by approximately $10 million of transactions costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the pending combination with Andeavor.
The higher earnings in MPLX, which includes the impact of the survey drop resulted in $89 million of increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of just over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $562 million in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had a $243 million favorable variance -- favorable impact to segment results largely due to lower RIN prices and the resulting higher effective crack. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $6.98 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $5.71 per barrel in the second quarter 2017.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet-sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $320 million versus last year. The differential increased to $9.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 from $5.48 per barrel in 2017. The LLS-WTI differential increased to $5.12 per barrel, up from $2.03 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove a $180 million benefit based from the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.
The favorable crude acquisition impacts were approximately $173 million captured in other margin were accentuated by a refinery utilization rate of 99.9% for the quarter, which resulted in a record crude oil throughput of 1.9 million barrels per day as well as strong volumetric gains in the higher pricing environment.
Direct operating cost had a favorable impact of $76 million to segment earnings mainly due to the absence of costs related to the refining logistics assets that were dropped to MPLX in February 1 and are now reported in the Midstream segment. These benefits were offset by several factors including the $219 million unfavorable variance and the product component of other margin, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.
Also offsetting the benefits was a $385 million unfavorable variance and other R&M expenses primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments, Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. Segment income from operations was $159 million, down $79 million from the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in segment results was primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.1645 per gallon in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the $0.1835 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Operating expenses increased $24 million year-over-year due mainly to higher labor and benefit cost, while depreciation was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investment in the business. The $6 million gain on sale of assets recorded in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed to the difference from the second quarter last year. 
In July, merchandise sales has started off strong. We've seen a 5.5% increase in same-store merchandise sales compared to last July, while same-store gasoline sales volumes have decreased about 1.8%.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the second quarter. Segment income was $617 million in the second quarter 2018 compared to $332 million in the same period 2017. The $328 million variance for MPLX was favorably impacted by $232 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to record, gathered, processed and fractionated volumes as well as record pipeline throughput volumes. 
As Don mentioned, we'd encourage you to look at the MPLX earnings release and join the update call at 11 to get more color on the partnership's great performance in the second quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes on our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, an increase of approximately $346 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.8 billion source from the quarter.
Working capital was a $544 million source of cash as higher crude and other payables more than offset a modest inventory build and an increase in receivables from crude oil and refined products in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, included $885 million of share repurchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $17 billion in total consolidated debt, including nearly $12 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.6x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.2x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Taking into account the distributions MPC received from MPLX, this same parent level was 1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We believe this parent level, including MPLX distributions look, is a more useful way to look at MPC's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. This year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will continue to be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.
Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2018. We're expecting total throughput volumes of approximately 2 million barrels per day, with planned maintenance currently taking place at our Canton Refinery and downtime scheduled for Detroit in -- for the Detroit Refinery in September.
Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7 per barrel. As a reminder, total direct operating cost now reflect the reduction of costs associated with the drops. We expect the net cost related to MPLX fees reflected in the other column of the R&M walk to be approximately $340 million per quarter on a going-forward basis.
Sour crude is estimated to make up 53% of our crude oil throughput for the third quarter, and WTI-priced crude is estimated to be about 32%, of the slate. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $85 million, prior to any transactions costs related with the Andeavor combination. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

And when you take the most conservative projection in the document and you add in likely merger cost and benefit, it appears that the combined company has an earnings outlook that's way above the consensus even though you appear to be using margin projections that are both flat or close to flat and well below the forward curve during '18 to '21. So my question's twofold: first, is my premise correct on the combined earnings outlook in relation to Street consensus? Or is there a more appropriate way to think about that information? And then second, can you confirm that the margin projections that are in the S-4 were utilized to reach those financial projections? And either way, was there a reason that they're conservative, at least, in relation to the forward curve given the fundamental and IMO 2020 outlook? So 2 different questions about the S-4 information."

So this is not meant for guidance, this was meant to value the 2 companies. And I would say that based on our outlook -- and the other thing, Doug, is, as you look right now at inventories across the globe, we believe that inventories are in very good shape across the entire globe. And I believe that, that's going to lead to upside potential as we get into the third quarter here. And as we then embark on 2019, which we think as where we're really going to start to see the upswing in the IMO effect. So those are not for guidance, those were for valuation purposes.

Of course, El Paso, Salt Lake, as you said, the Midcontinent continues to be strong, and we would expect that to continue. But going back and looking at the integration, and as Don reviewed, I would say we have the bit in our mouth and we're ready to go with this integration.

So again that authorization was one that we pursued at the board around the time of the announcement just -- frankly, because we know that once this business come together, as Don referenced, and I think we're continuing to feel very good about the incremental cash generation from the combination is going to be substantial. And so I think a big source of where that cash is going to go is likely going to be back to shareholders and likely in the form of share repurchase. So I think our approach from here forward, frankly, is going to remain consistent. There is -- there will be a period of time, I think, during the solicitation period, where we'll be precluded from that activity, but I'd call that a blip in the road as opposed to any sort of structural change.

One is the wage inflation that we're experiencing as a result of the low unemployment rates that we're seeing in the country now, and that's just putting competition for that labor at the store level for us. We're having to move hourly rates up in order to attract that labor. And I think to your question, I think what we're focused on is, we look at a number of technology investments that we're making, both outside and inside our store, to become more efficient so we can reduce the labor cost or control the labor cost to the point where we're competitive in that regard. And the other factor that's pushing the labor cost too is, we continue to add stores to our portfolio. So in the second quarter alone, we added 15 net stores. So that's net of both the new and rebuilds less the closed store locations. So there's more stores in our portfolio. And then we're also adding more complex stores as we spend money on remodels.

It'll take some time, but that is one of the key synergies and, I think, key operating efficiencies that we're going to be able to really transfer into those stores. That model or that platform that Speedway has, it manages all inventory. And if you have a technology that can manage inventory, you don't need people counting things. But it manages all inventory in and out of the store, it manages labor, it manages day parts of labor requirements in the store to hit your peak periods.

Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining our call. Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $",749,"Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining our call. Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row. 
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget. 
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward, and we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow. 
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream managing company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years. 
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We're already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019. 
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. 
Inventory levels remaining moderate and supply are near 5 year lows. We believe current distillate trends combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content will support strong distillate demand well into the future and we are well positioned to give the investments we have made in our business over the last decade.  As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S. 
Despite recently waker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline to distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day. 
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. 
We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels. As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day, of midcon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets. 
We're currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planed at the Robinson refinery. 
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plan to engage advisors and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our valuation and process and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time. 
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

Turning to Slide 4, we reported third quarter earnings of $737 million, and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptional",495,"Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 4, we reported third quarter earnings of $737 million, and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results, with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. 
We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter. 
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter. 
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business.  We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward. 
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continue to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. 
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business. 
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter, with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis, starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident. 
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving. 
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."

Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year.

For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings were $1.62 per diluted share, including pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transactions costs or approximately $0.08 per share. 
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround cost in the quarter. 
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. The $324 million favorable midstream variance was due to the first drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year. 
The unfavorable year-over-year variance and items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increase in employee benefit costs. 
Interest in financing costs we $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter. 
Interest and financing costs were -- income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income combined with lower tax rate resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year. 
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance. 
Turning to Slide 8, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The [ LLS based ] blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year. 
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018. 
The LSS WTI differential increased to [ $4.71 ] per barrel up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude on our slate. 
Direct operating cost for the third quarter was [ $6.60 ] per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter. 
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses. 
Moving to our other segments, Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. Speedway gasoline and distillate margin decreased to [ $0.165 ] per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to [ $0.177 ] per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level. 
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin. 
Operating expenses has increased $20 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit cost and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business. 
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year. 
Slide 10 provides the midterm segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The [ $361 million ] improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes. 
As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen to the call at 11:00 a.m. to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter. 
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter. 
Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchase in dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of share -- of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction both and closing. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business and system with maintaining the company's current investment credit grade profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. 
We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately [ $18.5 billion ] of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Lower [indiscernible] from MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent. 
Moving to Slide 13, we intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we wanted to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. 
On a consolidated basis, included in the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with our total guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day in December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton and we're just done about completing a turnaround at Martinez but especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day, a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing related crudes, which is a significant benefit and we have all that work behind us and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over [ 200 ] today and it may get into the [ 3 to mid-3s ] in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints.

You talked about the $1 billion we had a ramp that had us at like $480 million in Year 1, ramping up to the $1 billion. I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you examples, we talked a little bit about in my repaired comments about the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the midcontinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now if we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples, retail, crude acquisition of our refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver."

We are not in position at this time to give you a timeline over what that time period would take but it would be a big focus. I think importantly, for the synergies themselves though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean there are certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time but we will clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, well -- again we'll share some colors on Investor Day and beyond but we will be building a sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the call has been as we go along the way.

We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brand and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon Brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers as we meet with some of our customers as well to determine, which brands but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

Rail can only do so much and as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints. The difficulties of loading rail out. We kind of see that as a perfect storm, we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into the Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark.

It's a good question Phil, I'd say if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we have refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little more than 1.1 million barrels per day and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than [ $16.50 ] a barrel. We didn't have the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier, basically started in October. So we ran from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project in the cat cracker in Los Angeles, that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline at the market trade distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong but like the comments in Speedway with the raising crude price environment, that margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong, strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model and the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop just like we expected and with the participation and the way of pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system whether Corpus Christi or other places and so. I would say overall that the business performed very, very well and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call.Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter.

Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row.
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter.
During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years.
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.
Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.
As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.
We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business.
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident.
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving.
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."
118315802,586769980,1587254,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted sh",1285,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share.
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround costs in the quarter.
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year.
The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.
Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter.
Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million (sic) [ $283 million ] versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018.
The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.
Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter.
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.
Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business.
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote in closing.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Lower [indiscernible] for distributions from MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent.
Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

We mentioned our purchases being north of 500,000. We do not share and break down how much is fully discounted and how much isn't. What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3. And really, the relief won't happen, Neil, until you get another big pipeline out of the basin, which, by all accounts, might be lying 3 and that may be end of 2019 at best."

You talked about the $1 billion and we had a ramp that had us at like $480 million in year 1, ramping up to the $1 billion. I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples, retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver."

There are a couple of systems integration processes that are still underway within the legacy Andeavor business. We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way.

And so I really want to -- we're going to strive and we're going to talk about scale a lot with investors. So that's what we're seeing already. And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction.

That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system and the managers, the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brands and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

Yesterday, Beaver Lodge, which is an origin point that feeds DAPL, trade at $14 -- at a $14 differential. So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flushed with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flushed with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief, Phil, that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish this differential here going forward."

The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget.

With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanted to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an air of life, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future. And as I said earlier, we have the ability to run tremendous amount of medium sours, heavies, or we can keep it in the light range.

But one of the main drivers is the supply to Galveston Bay refinery. We've also expanded the Ozark Pipeline as well as the Wood River to Patoka Pipeline to get Cushing light material up into that area. And as Gary mentioned as well, we're also looking at what the market needs from an overall standpoint as far as exports. And we've talked to -- and we'll talk a little bit more on the later call on the Swordfish Pipeline, which is existing assets that we think is going to be very competitive and connecting that Eastern Gulf system to refineries into the export markets.

Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row.
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter.
During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years.
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.
Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.
As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.
We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business.
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident.
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving.
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."
118315802,586769980,1588647,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted sh",1289,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share.
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround costs in the quarter.
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year.
The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.
Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter.
Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million (sic) [ $283 million ] versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018.
The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.
Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter.
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.
Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business.
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote in closing.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. The lower [ YED ] of the distribution for MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent.
Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

First of all, with the -- in combining the new companies, we are really attempting to smooth out these turnarounds so we don't have a lumpy turnaround schedule in any given period. As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3.

I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors.

I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way. So this is something that's high in the radar. Whether the systems integrate or not, we'll have the full ability and anticipate reporting out in our progress along the way. So appreciate the question, Paul."

One of the things that we really want investors to understand, and it's what next week having a kind of our top 100 management team men for a full meeting, one of the things you need to recognize in a transaction like this is you need to step back and understand the scale, and you have to have a vision for how big this company has become. And the scale is going to be one of the most important parts, not only to driving synergy but to driving efficiency. And so I really want to -- we're going to strive and we're going to talk about scale a lot with investors. So that's what we're seeing already. And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction. It could be a very, very positive of that with a lot of momentum behind it. So that's really the point that I want to get across to investors."

Well, Paul, as we mentioned, we're already completing the turnaround of the St. Paul, Minnesota and Wisconsin assets from SuperAmerica into Speedway. We expect that to be done by the end of the year. From there, we have crews doing 7 to 8 stores every day. We're able to turn those stores that quick. And that -- when we say turn the store, that's not just putting signs out on the pumps and at the street. That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system and the managers, the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brands and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

And really, Bakken is kind of the forgotten basin, if you will, and it's extremely important to us. Yesterday, Beaver Lodge, which is an origin point that feeds DAPL, trade at $14 -- at a $14 differential. So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flushed with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flushed with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief, Phil, that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish this differential here going forward."

I would say, if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we had refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little bit more than 1.1 million barrels per day, and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget.

And while that has not happened yet, you really step back and say -- and look at the numbers, RINs have gone from $1.25 back in 2016, 2017, down to $0.78 this week. So we have made a tremendous amount of progress. It has to do with lower refinery -- or small refinery exemptions and the accounting of RINs beyond that. So we have had a tremendous improvement in the cost of the RINs. I'll ask Tim to -- if he can answer your question on what that value is. But as I said, we have made a lot of progress. We're not fully where we think the market needs to go and where the administration needs to go as far as fixing this RFS problem, but we're continuing to work on it diligently.

So I'm not sure we'd highlighted an incremental benefit to the lower RINs costs. It certainly introduces a lot less noise into the market relative to -- so what the real economic cracks are, but we would not identify any natural economic benefit in total to the system related to the lower prices."

As we've said in the past, Manav, we can run 70% light slate or 70% medium sour to heavy slate. With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanted to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an air of life, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future. And as I said earlier, we have the ability to run tremendous amount of medium sours, heavies, or we can keep it in the light range. The other thing that's so important that -- let me ask Mike Hennigan to just talk a second about the big pipeline projects coming out of the Permian and our strategy. Greg Goff had done the deal on Gray Oak Pipeline. Now we're looking at the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline. We're looking at Swordfish, example for the Eastern Gulf.

But one of the main drivers is the supply to Galveston Bay refinery. We've also expanded the Ozark Pipeline as well as the Wood River to Patoka Pipeline to get Cushing light material up into that area. And as Gary mentioned as well, we're also looking at what the market needs from an overall standpoint as far as exports. And we've talked to -- and we'll talk a little bit more on the later call on the Swordfish Pipeline, which is existing assets that we think is going to be very competitive and connecting that Eastern Gulf system to refineries into the export markets. So we're very attuned to the point that you made about light sweet growth.

We question whether or not they really have the authority to grant this E15 waiver year round. Adding incrementally, it's 3 months beyond what's already in the marketplace today. So it's not -- we kind of look at it as being de minimis. However, E85 -- excuse me, E15, the way it's marketed, is at 88 Octane.

Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row.
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years.
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong; inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.
Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.
As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.
We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business.
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident.
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving.
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."

For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share.
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and the higher turnaround costs in the quarter.
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year.
The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.
Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter.
Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million (sic) [ $283 million ] versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018.
The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.
Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter.
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.
Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business.
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. 
Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote and closing.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. The lower [ YED ] of the distributions for MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent.
Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. 
On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

First of all, with the -- in combining the new companies, we are really attempting to smooth out these turnarounds so we don't have a lumpy turnaround schedule in any given period. As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI and Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3. And really, the relief won't happen, Neil, until you get another big pipeline out of the basin, which, by all accounts, might be line 3 and that may be end of 2019 at best."

I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having -- supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples: retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver."

We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go. And again, the -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way.

Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other branded locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

So we kind of see that's the perfect storm. We add in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish of this differential here going forward."

I would say, if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we had refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little bit more than 1.1 million barrels per day, and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget. I think that was represented here in how well both sides performed while we had integration process going on.

So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an era of light, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future.

And I think you guys have touched upon this already on the call, but waterborne crude, particularly, I think, is sort of the other side of the question when you're talking about getting more domestic heavy discounted barrels than light barrels. And so just wanted to get some color on the current market. We've seen Maya differentials come in, maybe the Gulf Coast. Waterborne heavy barrels have been a little bit more difficult; they were in 3Q. So that's -- part one is sort of to ask about that in the Gulf Coast. But then also pro forma for the company if you look at PADD V as well, what we've heard from some other peers that waterborne heavier barrels were maybe a little bit more challenging compared to domestic versus ANS out there. So I wanted to get your thoughts around that, too, and maybe initiatives around sort of managing crude costs sort of more in the medium term pro forma for company in both of those regions."

The good news from our front on Maya is we run very little Maya, and we are able to pivot away from Maya and have great optionality to bring in other heavies. On the market tightening, I would agree with that, that it had tightened for a period of time, but I would tell you at this 10 seconds and looking forward, we're seeing a window where the market is now, the avails looks good, the economics behind the avails look good, both on heavy and [ Arab Gulf ] crudes as well as Latin American and crudes really throughout the -- throughout and around the globe.

Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call.Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter.

Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row.
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter.
During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years.
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.
Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.
As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.
We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business.
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident.
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving.
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."
118315802,586769980,1601973,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted sh",1289,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share.
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround costs in the quarter.
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year.
The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.
Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter.
Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million (sic) [ $283 million ] versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018.
The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.
Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter.
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.
Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business.
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote in closing.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. The lower [ YED ] of the distribution for MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent.
Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

And second, with cash flows that's derived significantly with the transaction, I want to see if you could provide some more color or the plan for share repurchases for the medium term because it seems like we should see a ramp in that area."

We mentioned our purchases being north of 500,000. We do not share and break down how much is fully discounted and how much isn't. What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3. And really, the relief won't happen, Neil, until you get another big pipeline out of the basin, which, by all accounts, might be lying 3 and that may be end of 2019 at best."

You talked about the $1 billion and we had a ramp that had us at like $480 million in year 1, ramping up to the $1 billion. I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples, retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver."

There are a couple of systems integration processes that are still underway within the legacy Andeavor business. We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way.

And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction.

Well, Paul, as we mentioned, we're already completing the turnaround of the St. Paul, Minnesota and Wisconsin assets from SuperAmerica into Speedway. We expect that to be done by the end of the year. From there, we have crews doing 7 to 8 stores every day. We're able to turn those stores that quick.

That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system and the managers, the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brands and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

Yesterday, Beaver Lodge, which is an origin point that feeds DAPL, trade at $14 -- at a $14 differential. So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flushed with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flushed with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief, Phil, that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish this differential here going forward."

The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget.

With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanted to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an air of life, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future.

Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row.
Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.
Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.
On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first 3 years.
Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong; inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.
Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.
With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.
As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.
We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.
Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.
Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?"

We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter.
Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.
MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in 2 long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.
On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.
While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business.
The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these 2 powerful businesses will be evident.
As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving.
We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.
With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter."
118315802,586769980,1606160,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted sh",1290,"Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share.
The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and the higher turnaround costs in the quarter.
Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year.
The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.
Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter.
Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.
The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.
Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $238 million (sic) [ $283 million ] versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018.
The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.
Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter.
The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses.
Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level.
Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.
Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business.
For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year.
Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.
Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. 
Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.
Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote and closing.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. The lower [ YED ] of the distributions for MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent.
Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. 
On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI and Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space."

What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3.

We were able to leverage having -- supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples: retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver."

We certainly take the point that getting back office systems, pulled together and integrated will be an important part, and I think we've recognized that from the outset. There are a couple of systems integration processes that are still underway within the legacy Andeavor business. We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go. And again, the -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way. So this is something that's high in the radar. [ Rather ] the systems integrate or not will have the full ability and anticipate reporting out in our progress along the way.

One of the things that we really want investors to understand, and it's what next week having a kind of our top 100 management team in for a full meeting, one of the things you need to recognize in a transaction like this is you need to step back and understand the scale, and you have to have a vision for how big this company has become. And the scale is going to be one of the most important parts, not only to driving synergy but to driving efficiency. And so I really want to -- we're going to strive and we're going to talk about scale a lot with investors because that's what we're seeing already. And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction. It could be a very, very positive of that with a lot of momentum behind it. So that's really the point that I want to get across to investors."

Well, Paul, as we mentioned, we're already completing the turnaround of the St. Paul, Minnesota and Wisconsin assets from SuperAmerica into Speedway. We expect that to be done by the end of the year. From there, we have crews doing 7 to 8 stores every day. We're able to turn those stores that quick. And that -- when we say turn the store, that's not just putting signs out on the pumps and at the street. That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system that manages the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other branded locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon."

So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flush with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flush with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief [ veil ], that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm. We add in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish of this differential here going forward."

I would say, if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we had refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little bit more than 1.1 million barrels per day, and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results."

When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget.

But our big push has been to have a refresh, if you will, of the renewable fuel standard. And while that has not happened yet, you really step back and say -- and look at the numbers, RINs have gone from $1.25 back in 2016, 2017, down to $0.78 this week. So we have made a tremendous amount of progress. It has to do with lower refinery -- or small refinery exemptions and the accounting of RINs beyond that. So we have had a tremendous improvement in the cost of the RINs. I'll ask Tim to -- if he can answer your question on what that value is. But as I said, we have made a lot of progress. We're not fully where we think the market needs to go and where the administration needs to go as far as fixing this RFS problem, but we're continuing to work on it diligently.

I think we are -- we have a pretty convicted view that as RIN prices rise, it gets reflected in the crack, and on a net basis, the system is no better or worse off than where things are at. So I'm not sure we'd highlighted an incremental benefit to the lower RINs costs. It certainly introduces a lot less noise into the market relative to sort of what the real economic cracks are, but we would not identify any natural economic benefit in total to the system related to the lower prices."

As we've said in the past, Manav, we can run 70% light slate or 70% medium sour to heavy slate. With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanting to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an era of light, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future. And as I said earlier, we have the ability to run tremendous amount of medium sours, heavies, or we can keep it in the light range. The other thing that's so important that -- let me ask Mike Hennigan to just talk a second about the big pipeline projects coming out of the Permian and our strategy. Greg Goff had done the deal on Gray Oak Pipeline. Now we're looking at the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline. We're looking at Swordfish, example for the Eastern Gulf. So we have tremendous opportunities there that I think helps our feedstock supply as well. Mike, you want to talk about that strategy?"

But one of the main drivers is the supply to Galveston Bay refinery. We've also expanded the Ozark Pipeline as well as the Wood River to Patoka Pipeline to get Cushing light material up into that area. And as Gary mentioned as well, we're also looking at what the market needs from an overall standpoint as far as exports. And we've talked to -- and we'll talk a little bit more on the later call on the Swordfish Pipeline, which is existing assets that we think is going to be very competitive in connecting that Eastern Gulf system to refiners and to the export markets. So we're very attuned to the point that you made about light sweet growth.

And so just wanted to get some color on the current market. We've seen Maya differentials come in, maybe the Gulf Coast. Waterborne heavy barrels have been a little bit more difficult; they were in 3Q. So that's -- part one is sort of to ask about that in the Gulf Coast. But then also pro forma for the company if you look at PADD V as well, what we've heard from some other peers that waterborne heavier barrels were maybe a little bit more challenging compared to domestic versus ANS out there.

On the market tightening, I would agree with that, that it had tightened for a period of time, but I would tell you at this 10 seconds and looking forward, we're seeing a window where the market is now, the avails looks good, the economics behind the avails look good, both on heavy and [ Arab Gulf ] crudes as well as Latin American and crudes really throughout the -- throughout and around the globe.

So as we continue to study that, the procedures and implementation processes are not out yet from the EPA on how they would implement this. We question whether or not they really have the authority to grant this E15 waiver year round. Adding incrementally, it's 3 months beyond what's already in the marketplace today. So it's not -- we kind of look at it as being de minimis. However, E85 -- excuse me, E15, the way it's marketed, is at 88 Octane.
