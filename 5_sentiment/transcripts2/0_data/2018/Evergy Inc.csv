Last night, we announced year-end 2017 EPS of $2.27 compared to $2.43 in 2016.

Last night, we announced year-end 2017 EPS of $2.27 compared to $2.43 in 2016. Importantly, these GAAP results include merger expenses of about $0.06 of earnings as well as $0.09 of deferred tax assets due to the new tax law. Additionally, year-over-year, we estimate weather cost us $0.08 and we received no for the tune of about $0.14. Those things considered, we're pleased with the year and the lower expenses that help offset the negatives. Gross margin decreased just over 2% due mainly to 13% fewer cooling degree days compared to the prior year. This drove residential commercial sales down year-over-year about 4%, 2%, respectively. Providing a partial offset, industrial sales were up 3.5%. The healthy increase was primarily driven by a handful of large lower margin customers, that experienced increased demand as oil prices rebounded throughout the year. In December, one of our largest customers, Aerosystems delivered some exciting news. They've announced a significant expansion to their factory, where among other things, they make for the Boeing Dreamliner. They expansion mean a billion dollar investment and a thousand new jobs over the next couple of years. Offsetting some of the impact of software sales and lack of cooling income was a decrease combined O&M and SG&A of $24 million compared to the prior year. Well, there was a basket of drivers, significant items include a lower distribution expense of $9 million as we redirected resources to assist other utilities of  -- $5 million lower cost at one of our large generating plants that had a planned outage in 2016 and $7 million less variable employee compensation compared to the prior year. Interest expense was up $9 million, due mainly to a long-term debt issuance in March of '17 and a full year impact of bonds issued in June of '16. Depreciation expense increased $33 million due mainly to the commissioning of our Western Plains Wind Farm early in the year. Until this project is fully reflected and raised, production tax credit spread offset to depreciation, financing and operating cost. If you recall, we estimated the all-in impact to be flat to a couple cent drag to earnings, assuming a mid-40s capacity factor. Changes didn't disappoint, we end up with a capacity factor in the upper 40s, which resulted in more PTCs to help offset cost. Income tax expense decreased to around $30 million year-over-year. Primarily drivers included $24 million of new PTCs and $23 million from lower taxable income. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million write-off of excess deferred income tax assets that I mentioned previously.  I'll come back to tax in a moment. But first, let me quickly touch on fourth quarter results. Q4 earnings per share were $0.24, down from $0.38 the prior year. While weather for the quarter was normal and we managed O&M well, the big drivers for the $12 million deferred tax asset write-off, $3 million Western cooling proceeds and a $3 million decrease in equity AFUDC. Now let me turn to tax reform. We've already agreed that all tax savings should go to our customers and put this into motion with our recent rate application. And customer rates will be about $24 million of tax benefit to be reflected in the outcome of this general rate update. In the interim, we'll track the effects of the lower federal tax rate with a at the end of the review. While we anticipate some cash flow headwinds, which may decrease FFO-to-debt by a 100 to 200 basis points, we expect to maintain our strong investment grade credit profile and anticipate the same for the combined company. As mentioned in our joint update with Great Plains last month, our initial review with tax reform doesn't materially change our plan. Let me quickly reiterate what we said in January. We are still targeting EPS growth of 6% to 8%, measured off of Westar's 2016 actually EPS of 243. And growing the dividends at approximately the same rate, we still expect to repurchase roughly 60 million shares at the new company stock over the first 2 years after closing. The new tax law, including elimination of bonus depreciation and a lower accumulated deferred income tax resulted in approximately 4% compounded annual rate base growth through 2022. Now a few words about 2018. We won't issue Westar's stand-alone guidance, but we have included some assumptions in the supplemental materials we posted to our IR website last night. This will give you an idea what's in our current plan for things like COLI, transmission margin and merger expenses. For sales of 2018 plan reflects 0 to 50 basis points of growth. Last night, our board declared $0.40 quarterly dividend, which maintains the annual indicator rate of $1.60 per share. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to maintain this level until closing. Then at closing, we expect the new dividend to be indicated annual $1.18 per share, reflecting the 15% uplift embedded in exchange ratio. And now let me turn things over to Mark."

They continue to deliver solid financial and operating results, making their business better. Our safety performance last year was one of the best on record, and again, the best of our industry. We achieved in distribution and liability the best performance in our history. We continue to harness abundant wind resources, bringing commercial $400-plus million investment in more renewable. With the addition of Western Plains, we now produce Renewable Energy equivalent to a third of retail sales. Add nuclear to it, and we had emission free energy of more than 50% of these sales. These resources plus the flexibility of how we're now operating our fossil plants have allowed us to cut carbon emissions by 39% since '05. Additionally, SO2 was down 98% and knocked down 84% over the same period. These and other commitments to the communities we've the privilege of serving and along with the important work over Westar Energy Green team, we've highlighted in our new ESG report that you can find on our website. Of course, the more significant development last year was a new course we in July as we announced through our revised merger agreement with Great Plains. Combining this 2 neighboring utilities just make sense. We expected to create 1 of the best energy companies in the country with more levers to pull to address industry headwind and position us to moderate price increases for our customers and deliver top tier value to our shareholders. Let me shift to a broader update on regulatory and other news before I touch on the wages with the merger. A few weeks ago, public and former Lieutenant Governor, Dr. Jeff Collier, took the oath of office as Kansas 47 Governor. He replaces Governor Brown Back, who stepped down to become the U.S. embassador. We're confident Governor Collier understands what takes Kansas forward and how a healthy infrastructure is necessary to make that happen. Late last year, KCC Commissioner, Pat Apple, announced that he won't accept reappointment once his term expires March 15. He was when he made this announcement. So in January, the commission reelected Commissioner as his new Chair. The Commissioner will maintain a quorum even if there is a period with only 2 commissioners, although, we expect Governor Collier to make his appointment before the expected order date in merger. Earlier this month, we filed for a general rate update as Tony mentioned. We're asking the KCC to update prices and recognized for our customers the full benefit of tax return along with other update. The request is straightforward with just a few drivers. The biggest of which, as Tony mentioned, is reflecting in rates about $74 million of annual federal tax reductions. We are already planned rate reviews this year, so the application became the fastest and most direct way to get the tax benefits back to our customers. Another significant part of the application is a $56 million update to depreciation. Every few years, the KCC requires a depreciation study of us and this fulfills that requirement. Other drivers of the case include, $32 million for Western Plains, which has embedded in the value of related production tax credit. $41 million for an expiring wholesale contract, which has served as an offset to retail rates for a decade, but which can't be renewed in the present market. $13 million for expiring CTCs from our first wind farms, now approaching 10 years old. Offsetting some of the increases is the $11 million of initial savings in contemplation of the merger and $29 million of savings we've achieved by refinancing debt since rates were last set, and of course, the tax reductions I mentioned. Even though the rate update and the merger are separate dockets, they will reference one another given their timing and in the relationship. To that end, let me give you an update on the merger. In November, Westar and Great Plains each held special meetings with shareholders, in which shares rewarded were overwhelmingly greater than 90% for each company in favor of the merger. Just prior to do those meetings, we also settled the class Then in December, we received HSR clearance. We filed for FERC approval and requested from the NRC, a transfer of Wolf Creek license. We expect to hear from shortly. In Missouri, we carry forward momentum from the first deal. And in January, we, again, resettlement with the staff of the Missouri commission along with some other intervenors. This agreement accepts many of the same or similar commitments as in the first deal. We filed our rebuttal testimony yesterday and will have a hearing in Missouri the second week of March. There is no specific order date for merger or for an order in Missouri, but we is expect to have an effective order on the merger close to the post of Kansas schedule, which brings me back to Kansas. Late last month, the KCC staff curbed another intervenors filed their testimony. Given the vast differences of the application compared to the one that was rejected last year, the testimony has a significantly different and more constructive tone. As almost all players acknowledge, this much different transaction with the absence of a premium and transaction debt has set the stage for our solution that can satisfy the public interest standard Staff presented a framework, that with some adjustment and clarification, we think, could be workable solution to address all parties interest. On Monday, we filed our testimony in response. The KCC schedule calls for someone talks to be held next week with a hearing in mid-March and a commission order on or before June 5. Even if we were to reach a settlement, we expect the calendar and the procedural schedule to play out much stated. significant value for customers and shareholders in bringing these 2 neighboring utilities together. The merger, as we testified, is the single course of action we can take to best manage or moderate future utility rates. Every company faces headwinds, some of these are best addressed by the efficiencies created through consolidation. And that's why we've been playing so hard to bring these 2 companies together and hopeful with other parties delivery. With that, we're ready for your questions. Members of the media, we invite you to contact Gina Penzig. Gina's number is (785) 575-8089 if you have media question. But with that, Michelle, would you open the lines please?"

Last night, we announced year-end 2017 EPS of $2.27 compared to $2.43 in 2016. Importantly, these GAAP results include merger expenses of about $0.06 of earnings as well as writing off $0.09 of deferred tax asset due to the new tax law. Additionally, year-over-year, we estimate weather cost us $0.08. And we received no COLI in complete year, which hurt us the tune of about $0.14. Those things considered, we're pleased with the year and the lower expenses that help offset the negatives.
Gross margin decreased just over 2%, due mainly to 13% fewer cooling degree days compared to the prior year. This drove residential and commercial sales down year-over-year about 4% and 2%, respectively. Providing a partial offset, industrial sales were up 3.5%. The healthy increase was primarily driven by a handful of large lower margin customers that experienced increased demand as oil prices rebounded throughout the year.
In December, one of our largest customers, Spirit AeroSystems delivered some exciting news. They've announced a significant expansion to their factory, where, among other things, they make fuselages for the Boeing Dreamliner. They know the expansion will mean a billion dollar investment and a thousand new jobs over the next couple of years. Offsetting some of the impact of software sales and lack of COLI income was a decrease combined O&M and SG&A of $24 million compared to the prior year. Well, there was a basket of drivers, significant items include a lower distribution expense of $9 million as we redirected resources to assist other utilities with mutual aid, $5 million lower cost at one of our large generating plants that had a planned outage in 2016 and $7 million less variable employee compensation compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense was up $9 million, due mainly to a long-term debt issuance in March '17, and a full year impact of bonds issued in June '16. Depreciation expense increased $33 million, due mainly to the commissioning of our Western Plains Wind Farm early in the year. Until this project is fully reflected and raised, production tax credit spread offset to depreciation, financing and operating cost. If you recall, we estimated the all-in impact to be flat to a couple of cent drag to earnings, assuming a mid-40s capacity factor. Kansas wind didn't disappoint. We ended up with a capacity factor in the upper 40s, which resulted in more PTCs to help offset cost. 
Income tax expense decreased around $30 million year-over-year. Primary drivers included $24 million of new PTCs and $23 million from lower taxable income. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million write-off of excess deferred income tax assets that I mentioned previously. I'll come back to other impacts of the tax law in a moment, but first, let me touch -- quickly touch on fourth quarter results. Q4 earnings per share were $0.24, down from $0.38 the prior year. While weather for the quarter was normal and we managed O&M well, the big drivers for the $12 million deferred tax asset write-off, $3 million Western COLI proceeds and a $3 million decrease in equity AFUDC. 
Now let me turn to tax reform. We've already agreed that all tax savings should go to our customers and put this in motion with our recent rate application. And customers' rates will be about $74 million of tax benefit to be reflected in the outcome of this general rate update. In the interim, we'll track the effects of the lower federal tax rate with a true-up at the end of the review. While we anticipate some cash flow headwinds, which may decrease FFO-to-debt by a 100 to 200 basis points, we expect to maintain our strong investment-grade credit profile and anticipate the same for the combined company. 
As mentioned in our joint update with Great Plains last month, our initial review with tax reform doesn't materially change our plan. Let me quickly reiterate what we said in January. We are still targeting EPS growth of 6% to 8%, measured off of Westar's 2016 actual EPS of $2.43. And growing dividends at approximately the same rate, we still expect to repurchase roughly 60 million shares of a new company stock over the first 2 years after closing. The new tax law, including elimination of bonus depreciation and a lower accumulated deferred income tax, results in approximately 4% compounded annual rate base growth through 2022.
Now a few words about 2018. We won't issue Westar's stand-alone guidance, but we have included some assumptions in the supplemental materials we posted to our IR website last night. This will give you an idea what's in our current plan for things like COLI, transmission margin and merger expenses. For sales, our 2018 plan reflects 0 to 50 basis points of growth. Last night, our board declared a $0.40 quarterly dividend, which maintains the annual indicator rate of $1.60 per share. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to maintain this level until closing. Then, at closing, we expect the new dividend to be indicated annual $1.84 per share, reflecting the 15% uplift embedded in the exchange ratio. 
Now let me turn things over to Mark."

Amidst the merger to mold, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance",1107,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was good year of execution. Amidst the merger to mold, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance last year was one of the best on record, and again, the best quartile of our industry. We achieved in distribution reliability the best performance in our history. We continued to harness Kansas abundant wind resources, bringing commercial $400-plus million investment in more renewable. With the addition of Western Plains, we now produce renewable energy equivalent to 1/3 of retail sales. Add nuclear to it, and we had emission-free energy of more than 50% of these sales. These resources plus the flexibility of how we're now operating our fossil plants have allowed us to cut carbon emissions by 39% since '05. Additionally, SO2 was down 98% and NOx down 84% over the same period. These and other commitments to the communities we've a privilege of serving and along with the important work of our Westar Energy Green team, we highlighted in our new ESG report that you can find on our website. 
Of course, the most significant development last year was a new course we charted in July as we announced a revised merger agreement with Great Plains. Combining these 2 neighboring utilities just make sense. We expected to create one of the best energy companies in the country, with more levers to pull to address industry headwind and position us to moderate price increases for our customer and deliver top-tier value to our shareholders. 
Let me shift to a broader update on regulatory and other news before I touch on the latest with the merger. A few weeks ago, republican and former Lieutenant Governor, Dr. Jeff Colyer, took the oath of office as Kansas 47th Governor. He replaces Governor Brownback, who stepped down to become the U.S. ambassador. We're confident Governor Colyer understands what it takes to move Kansas forward and how a healthy infrastructure is necessary to make that happen. 
Late last year, KCC Commissioner, Pat Apple, announced that he won't accept reappointment once his term expires March 15. He was Chair when he made this announcement. So in January, the commission reelected Commissioner Shari Feist Albrecht as its new Chair. The Commissioner will maintain a quorum even if there is a period with only 2 commissioners, although we expect Governor Colyer to make his appointment before the expected order date in the merger. 
Earlier this month, we filed for a general rate update as Tony mentioned. We're asking the KCC to update prices and recognize for our customers the full benefit of tax return along with other update. The request is straightforward with just a few drivers. The biggest of which, as Tony mentioned, is reflecting in rates about $74 million of annual federal tax reductions. We had already planned rate reviews this year, so the application became the fastest and most direct way to get the tax benefits back to our customers. Another significant part of the application is a $56 million update to depreciation. Every few years, the KCC requires a depreciation study hours and this fulfills that requirement. Other drivers of the case include: $32 million for Western Plains, which has embedded in it the value of related production tax credit; $41 million for an expiring wholesale contract, which has served as an offset to retail rates for a decade, but which can't be renewed in the present market; $13 million for expiring PTCs from our first wind farms, now approaching 10 years old; offsetting some of the increases is the $11 million of initial savings in contemplation of the merger; and $29 million of savings we've achieved by refinancing debt since rates were last set; and of course, the tax reductions I mentioned. Even though the rate update and the merger are separate dockets, they will reference one another given their timing and in a relationship. 
To that end, let me give you an update on the merger. In November, Westar and Great Plains each held special meetings with shareholders, in which shares voted were overwhelmingly greater than 90% for each company in favor of the merger. Just prior to those meetings, we also settled the class action suits. Then in December, we received HSR clearance. We filed for FERC approval and requested from the NRC a transfer of Wolf Creek license. We expect to hear from each shortly. In Missouri, we carried forward momentum from the first deal. And in January, we again reached settlement with the staff of the Missouri commission along with some other intervenors. This agreement accepts many of the same or similar commitments as in the first deal. We filed our rebuttal testimony yesterday, and we'll have a hearing in Missouri the second week of March. There is no specific order date for a merger -- for an order in Missouri, but we expect to have an effective order on the merger close to the posted Kansas schedule, which brings me back to Kansas. 
Late last month, the KCC staff, CURB and other intervenors filed their testimony. Given the vast differences of this application compared to the one that was rejected last year, the testimony has a significantly different and more constructive tone. As almost all parties acknowledge, this much different transaction, with the absence of a premium and transaction data, set the stage for a solution that can satisfy the public interest standard again. Staff presented a framework that with some adjustment in clarification, we think, could be a workable solution to address all parties' interest. 
On Monday, we filed our testimony in response. The KCC schedule calls for settlement talks to be held next week with a hearing in mid-March and a commission order on or before June 5. Even if we were to reach a settlement, we expect the calendar and the procedural schedule to play out much as it stated. There's significant value for our customers and shareholders in bringing these 2 neighboring utilities together. The merger, as we've testified, is the single course of action we can take to best manage and moderate future utility rate. Every company faces headwinds, some of these are best addressed by the efficiencies created through consolidation. And that's why we've been fighting so hard to bring these 2 companies together and hopeful that other parties will agree.

Last night, we announced year-end 2017 EPS of $2.27 compared to $2.43 in 2016. Importantly, these GAAP results include merger expenses of about $0.06 of earnings as well as writing off $0.09 of deferred tax asset due to the new tax law. Additionally, year-over-year, we estimate weather cost us $0.08. And we received no COLI income for the year, which hurt us the tune of about $0.14. Those things considered, we're pleased with the year and the lower expenses that help offset the negatives.
Gross margin decreased just over 2%, due mainly to 13% fewer cooling degree days compared to the prior year. This drove residential and commercial sales down year-over-year about 4% and 2%, respectively. Providing a partial offset, industrial sales were up 3.5%. The healthy increase was primarily driven by a handful of large lower margin customers that experienced increased demand as oil prices rebounded throughout the year.
In December, one of our largest customers, Spirit AeroSystems delivered some exciting news. They've announced a significant expansion to their factory, where, among other things, they make fuselages for the Boeing Dreamliner. They know the expansion will mean a billion-dollar investment and 1,000 new jobs over the next couple of years. Offsetting some of the impact of softer sales and lack of COLI income, was a decrease combined O&M and SG&A of $24 million compared to the prior year. While there was a basket of drivers, significant items include a lower distribution expense of $9 million as we redirected resources to assist other utilities of mutual aid, $5 million lower cost at one of our large generating plants that had a planned outage in 2016 and $7 million less variable employee compensation compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense was up $9 million, due mainly to a long-term debt issuance in March '17, and a full year impact of bonds issued in June '16. Depreciation expense increased $33 million, due mainly to the commissioning of our Western Plains Wind Farm early in the year. Until this project is fully reflected in rates, production tax credits provide an offset to depreciation, financing and operating cost. If you recall, we estimated the all-in impact to be flat to a couple of cent drag to earnings, assuming a mid-40s capacity factor. Kansas wind didn't disappoint. We ended up with a capacity factor in the upper 40s, which resulted in more PTCs to help offset cost. 
Income tax expense decreased around $30 million year-over-year. Primary drivers included $24 million of new PTCs and $23 million from lower taxable income. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million write-off of excess deferred income tax assets that I mentioned previously. I'll come back to other impacts of the tax law in a moment, but first, let me touch -- quickly touch on fourth quarter results. Q4 earnings per share were $0.24, down from $0.38 the prior year. While weather for the quarter was normal and we managed O&M well, the big drivers were the $12 million deferred tax asset write-off, $3 million less in COLI proceeds and a $3 million decrease in equity AFUDC. 
Now let me turn to tax reform. We've already agreed that all tax savings should go to our customers and put this in motion with our recent rate application. And customers' rates will be about $74 million of tax benefit to be reflected in the outcome of this general rate update. In the interim, we'll track the effects of the lower federal tax rate with a true-up at the end of the review. While we anticipate some cash flow headwinds, which may decrease FFO-to-debt by a 100 to 200 basis points, we expect to maintain our strong investment-grade credit profile and anticipate the same for the combined company. 
As mentioned in our joint update with Great Plains last month, our initial review with tax reform doesn't materially change our plans. Let me quickly reiterate what we said in January. We are still targeting EPS growth of 6% to 8%, measured off of Westar's 2016 actual EPS of $2.43. And growing dividends at approximately the same rate, we still expect to repurchase roughly 60 million shares of new company stock over the first 2 years after closing. The new tax law, including elimination of bonus depreciation and a lower accumulated deferred income tax, results in approximately 4% compounded annual rate base growth through 2022.
Now a few words about 2018. We won't issue Westar's stand-alone guidance, but we have included some assumptions in the supplemental materials we posted to our IR website last night. This will give you an idea what's in our current plan for things like COLI, transmission margin and merger expenses. For sales, our 2018 plan reflects 0 to 50 basis points of growth. Last night, our board declared a $0.40 quarterly dividend, which maintains the annual indicator rate of $1.60 per share. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to maintain this level until closing. Then, at closing, we expect the new dividend to be indicated annual $1.84 per share, reflecting the 15% uplift embedded in the exchange ratio. 
Now let me turn things over to Mark."

Amidst the merger tumult, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance",1110,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a good year of execution. Amidst the merger tumult, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance last year was one of the best on record, and again, in the best quartile of our industry. We achieved in distribution reliability the best performance in our history. We continued to harness Kansas abundant wind resources, bringing Commercial a $400-plus million investment in more renewables. With the addition of Western Plains, we now produce renewable energy equivalent to 1/3 of retail sales. Add nuclear to it, and we had emission-free energy of more than 50% of these sales. These resources plus the flexibility of how we're now operating our fossil plants have allowed us to cut carbon emissions by 39% since '05. Additionally, SO2 was down 98% and NOx down 84% over the same period. These and other commitments to the communities we have the privilege of serving and along with the important work of our Westar Energy Green Team, we've highlighted in our new ESG report that you can find on our website. 
Of course, the most significant development last year was a new course we charted in July as we announced a revised merger agreement with Great Plains. Combining these 2 neighboring utilities just makes sense. We expect it to create one of the best energy companies in the country, with more levers to pull to address industry headwinds and position us to moderate price increases for our customer and deliver top-tier value to our shareholders. 
Let me shift to a broader update on regulatory and other news before I touch on the latest with the merger. A few weeks ago, republican and former Lieutenant Governor, Dr. Jeff Colyer, took the oath of office as Kansas' 47th Governor. He replaces Governor Brownback, who stepped down to become a U.S. ambassador. We're confident Governor Colyer understands what it takes to move Kansas forward and how a healthy infrastructure is necessary to make that happen. 
Late last year, KCC Commissioner, Pat Apple, announced that he won't accept reappointment once his term expires March 15. He was Chair when he made this announcement. So in January, the commission reelected Commissioner Shari Feist Albrecht as its new Chair. The Commission will maintain a quorum even if there is a period with only 2 commissioners, although we expect Governor Colyer to make his appointment before the expected order date in the merger. 
Earlier this month, we filed for a general rate update as Tony mentioned. We're asking the KCC to update prices and recognize for our customers the full benefit of tax return along with other updates. The request is straightforward with just a few drivers. The biggest of which, as Tony mentioned, is reflecting in rates about $74 million of annual federal tax reductions. We had already planned rate reviews this year, so the application became the fastest and most direct way to get the tax benefits back to our customers. Another significant part of the application is a $56 million update to depreciation. Every few years, the KCC requires a depreciation study of us and this fulfills that requirement. Other drivers of the case include: $32 million for Western Plains, which has embedded in it the value of related production tax credit; $41 million for an expiring wholesale contract, which has served as an offset to retail rates for a decade, but which can't be renewed in the present market; $13 million for expiring PTCs from our first wind farms, now approaching 10 years old; offsetting some of the increases is $11 million of initial savings in contemplation of the merger; and $29 million of savings we've achieved by refinancing debt since rates were last set; and of course, the tax reductions I mentioned. Even though the rate update and the merger are separate dockets, they will reference one another given their timing and inner-relationship. 
To that end, let me give you an update on the merger. In November, Westar and Great Plains each held special meetings with shareholders, in which shares voted were overwhelmingly greater than 90% for each company in favor of the merger. Just prior to those meetings, we also settled the class action suits. Then in December, we received HSR clearance. We filed for FERC approval and requested from the NRC a transfer of Wolf Creek's license. We expect to hear from each shortly. In Missouri, we carried forward momentum from the first deal. And in January, we again reached settlement with the staff of the Missouri Commission along with some other intervenors. This agreement accepts many of the same or similar commitments as in the first deal. We filed our rebuttal testimony yesterday, and we'll have a hearing in Missouri the second week of March. There is no specific order date for a merger -- for an order in Missouri, but we expect to have an effective order on the merger close to the posted Kansas schedule, which brings me back to Kansas. 
Late last month, the KCC staff, CURB and other intervenors filed their testimony. Given the vast differences of this application compared to the one that was rejected last year, the testimony has a significantly different and more constructive tone. As almost all parties acknowledge, this much different transaction, with the absence of a premium and transaction [data], set the stage for a solution that can satisfy the public interest standard in Kansas. Staff presented a framework that with some adjustment in clarification, we think, could be a workable solution to address all parties' interests. 
On Monday, we filed our testimony in response. The KCC schedule calls for settlement talks to be held next week with a hearing in mid-March and a commission order on or before June 5. Even if we were to reach a settlement, we expect the calendar and the procedural schedule to play out much as it stated. There's significant value for our customers and shareholders in bringing these 2 neighboring utilities together. The merger, as we've testified, is the single course of action we can take to best manage and moderate future utility rate. Every company faces headwinds, some of these are best addressed by the efficiencies created through consolidation. And that's why we've been fighting so hard to bring these 2 companies together and hopeful that other parties will agree.

Last night, we announced year-end 2017 EPS of $2.27 compared to $2.43 in 2016. Importantly, these GAAP results include merger expenses of about $0.06 of earnings as well as writing off $0.09 of deferred tax asset due to the new tax law. Additionally, year-over-year, we estimate weather cost us $0.08. And we received no COLI income for the year, which hurt us the tune of about $0.14. Those things considered, we're pleased with the year and the lower expenses that help offset the negatives.
Gross margin decreased just over 2%, due mainly to 13% fewer cooling degree days compared to the prior year. This drove residential and commercial sales down year-over-year about 4% and 2%, respectively. Providing a partial offset, industrial sales were up 3.5%. The healthy increase was primarily driven by a handful of large lower margin customers that experienced increased demand as oil prices rebounded throughout the year.
In December, one of our largest customers, Spirit AeroSystems delivered some exciting news. They've announced a significant expansion to their factory, where, among other things, they make fuselages for the Boeing Dreamliner. They know the expansion will mean a billion-dollar investment and 1,000 new jobs over the next couple of years. Offsetting some of the impact of softer sales and lack of COLI income, was a decrease combined O&M and SG&A of $24 million compared to the prior year. While there was a basket of drivers, significant items include a lower distribution expense of $9 million as we redirected resources to assist other utilities of mutual aid, $5 million lower cost at one of our large generating plants that had a planned outage in 2016 and $7 million less variable employee compensation compared to the prior year.
Interest expense was up $9 million, due mainly to a long-term debt issuance in March '17, and a full year impact of bonds issued in June '16. Depreciation expense increased $33 million, due mainly to the commissioning of our Western Plains Wind Farm early in the year. Until this project is fully reflected in rates, production tax credits provide an offset to depreciation, financing and operating cost. If you recall, we estimated the all-in impact to be flat to a couple of cent drag to earnings, assuming a mid-40s capacity factor. Kansas wind didn't disappoint. We ended up with a capacity factor in the upper 40s, which resulted in more PTCs to help offset cost.
Income tax expense decreased around $30 million year-over-year. Primary drivers included $24 million of new PTCs and $23 million from lower taxable income. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million write-off of excess deferred income tax assets that I mentioned previously. I'll come back to other impacts of the tax law in a moment, but first, let me touch -- quickly touch on fourth quarter results. Q4 earnings per share were $0.24, down from $0.38 the prior year. While weather for the quarter was normal and we managed O&M well, the big drivers were the $12 million deferred tax asset write-off, $3 million less in COLI proceeds and a $3 million decrease in equity AFUDC.
Now let me turn to tax reform. We've already agreed that all tax savings should go to our customers and put this in motion with our recent rate application. And customers' rates will be about $74 million of tax benefit to be reflected in the outcome of this general rate update. In the interim, we'll track the effects of the lower federal tax rate with a true-up at the end of the review. While we anticipate some cash flow headwinds, which may decrease FFO-to-debt by a 100 to 200 basis points, we expect to maintain our strong investment-grade credit profile and anticipate the same for the combined company.
As mentioned in our joint update with Great Plains last month, our initial review with tax reform doesn't materially change our plans. Let me quickly reiterate what we said in January. We are still targeting EPS growth of 6% to 8%, measured off of Westar's 2016 actual EPS of $2.43. And growing dividends at approximately the same rate, we still expect to repurchase roughly 60 million shares of new company stock over the first 2 years after closing. The new tax law, including elimination of bonus depreciation and a lower accumulated deferred income tax, results in approximately 4% compounded annual rate base growth through 2022.
Now a few words about 2018. We won't issue Westar's stand-alone guidance, but we have included some assumptions in the supplemental materials we posted to our IR website last night. This will give you an idea what's in our current plan for things like COLI, transmission margin and merger expenses. For sales, our 2018 plan reflects 0 to 50 basis points of growth. Last night, our board declared a $0.40 quarterly dividend, which maintains the annual indicator rate of $1.60 per share. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to maintain this level until closing. Then, at closing, we expect the new dividend to be indicated annual $1.84 per share, reflecting the 15% uplift embedded in the exchange ratio.
Now let me turn things over to Mark."

Amidst the merger tumult, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance",1110,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a good year of execution. Amidst the merger tumult, our employees didn't drop any balls. They continued to deliver solid financial and operating results, making our business better. Our safety performance last year was one of the best on record, and again, in the best quartile of our industry. We achieved in distribution reliability the best performance in our history. We continued to harness Kansas abundant wind resources, bringing Commercial a $400-plus million investment in more renewables. With the addition of Western Plains, we now produce renewable energy equivalent to 1/3 of retail sales. Add nuclear to it, and we had emission-free energy of more than 50% of these sales. These resources plus the flexibility of how we're now operating our fossil plants have allowed us to cut carbon emissions by 39% since '05. Additionally, SO2 was down 98% and NOx down 84% over the same period. These and other commitments to the communities we have the privilege of serving and along with the important work of our Westar Energy Green Team, we've highlighted in our new ESG report that you can find on our website.
Of course, the most significant development last year was a new course we charted in July as we announced a revised merger agreement with Great Plains. Combining these 2 neighboring utilities just makes sense. We expect it to create one of the best energy companies in the country, with more levers to pull to address industry headwinds and position us to moderate price increases for our customer and deliver top-tier value to our shareholders.
Let me shift to a broader update on regulatory and other news before I touch on the latest with the merger. A few weeks ago, republican and former Lieutenant Governor, Dr. Jeff Colyer, took the oath of office as Kansas' 47th Governor. He replaces Governor Brownback, who stepped down to become a U.S. ambassador. We're confident Governor Colyer understands what it takes to move Kansas forward and how a healthy infrastructure is necessary to make that happen.
Late last year, KCC Commissioner, Pat Apple, announced that he won't accept reappointment once his term expires March 15. He was Chair when he made this announcement. So in January, the commission reelected Commissioner Shari Feist Albrecht as its new Chair. The Commission will maintain a quorum even if there is a period with only 2 commissioners, although we expect Governor Colyer to make his appointment before the expected order date in the merger.
Earlier this month, we filed for a general rate update as Tony mentioned. We're asking the KCC to update prices and recognize for our customers the full benefit of tax return along with other updates. The request is straightforward with just a few drivers. The biggest of which, as Tony mentioned, is reflecting in rates about $74 million of annual federal tax reductions. We had already planned rate reviews this year, so the application became the fastest and most direct way to get the tax benefits back to our customers. Another significant part of the application is a $56 million update to depreciation. Every few years, the KCC requires a depreciation study of us and this fulfills that requirement. Other drivers of the case include: $32 million for Western Plains, which has embedded in it the value of related production tax credit; $41 million for an expiring wholesale contract, which has served as an offset to retail rates for a decade, but which can't be renewed in the present market; $13 million for expiring PTCs from our first wind farms, now approaching 10 years old; offsetting some of the increases is $11 million of initial savings in contemplation of the merger; and $29 million of savings we've achieved by refinancing debt since rates were last set; and of course, the tax reductions I mentioned. Even though the rate update and the merger are separate dockets, they will reference one another given their timing and inner-relationship.
To that end, let me give you an update on the merger. In November, Westar and Great Plains each held special meetings with shareholders, in which shares voted were overwhelmingly greater than 90% for each company in favor of the merger. Just prior to those meetings, we also settled the class action suits. Then in December, we received HSR clearance. We filed for FERC approval and requested from the NRC a transfer of Wolf Creek's license. We expect to hear from each shortly. In Missouri, we carried forward momentum from the first deal. And in January, we again reached settlement with the staff of the Missouri Commission along with some other intervenors. This agreement accepts many of the same or similar commitments as in the first deal. We filed our rebuttal testimony yesterday, and we'll have a hearing in Missouri the second week of March. There is no specific order date for a merger -- for an order in Missouri, but we expect to have an effective order on the merger close to the posted Kansas schedule, which brings me back to Kansas.
Late last month, the KCC staff, CURB and other intervenors filed their testimony. Given the vast differences of this application compared to the one that was rejected last year, the testimony has a significantly different and more constructive tone. As almost all parties acknowledge, this much different transaction, with the absence of a premium and transaction [data], set the stage for a solution that can satisfy the public interest standard in Kansas. Staff presented a framework that with some adjustment in clarification, we think, could be a workable solution to address all parties' interests.
On Monday, we filed our testimony in response. The KCC schedule calls for settlement talks to be held next week with a hearing in mid-March and a commission order on or before June 5. Even if we were to reach a settlement, we expect the calendar and the procedural schedule to play out much as it stated. There's significant value for our customers and shareholders in bringing these 2 neighboring utilities together. The merger, as we've testified, is the single course of action we can take to best manage and moderate future utility rate. Every company faces headwinds, some of these are best addressed by the efficiencies created through consolidation. And that's why we've been fighting so hard to bring these 2 companies together and hopeful that other parties will agree.

Last night, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.42 per share solid results in flat to a year ago in part due to the new tax law. Tony will give you full download on the quarter in just a bit. 
We've got a busy an effective start with the year on the regulatory front as we also keep our eye on financial and operating results alongside focusing on the future with the merger. 
Let me give you a quick update on our business before I touch on regulatory and merger matters. Operations started the year strong caring forward the momentum from record-setting reliability last year. Year-to-date, we operated our power plants with first quartile reliability even as we work our way through typical planned spring maintenance. 
Wolf Creek came off-line in late March for its regular 18-month refueling. This was after almost 500 days of runs since the last refueling in the fall of '16, no downtime. We expect to the plant to be back from refueling in next few days. 
First quarter capacity factor of our wind portfolio was just a few basis points shy of 50% and remarkably only a couple of percentage points lower than our coal plants, which we've now adapted to flex and cycle with market opportunities. 
In the last decade, we've grown our wind portfolio to more than 1,700 megawatts. That puts us on pace to reach an impressive milestone. By mid-year, we'll have produced over 25 million renewable megawatt hours. That's equivalent to about 500 megawatt coal plant operated for the same span or a carbon reduction equivalent of over 28 million tonnes. 
The combination of our renewable and nuclear generation supplied enough emission free energy to meet 2/3 of our retail customers' needs for the quarter. Renewables alone can meet 1/3 of our those needs annually and has allowed us to reduce carbon emissions by around 40% from our '05 levels. 
Before turning to the merger, let me give you a rate update. In January, we filed our annual transmission rate update. In February, we filed the companion retail update, which took effect April 1. For the year, rate update increased transmission margin by about $4 million. Also, in February, we filed with the KCC for a general rate review. 
The commission set the procedural schedule that calls for a settlement conference on July 9, evidentiary hearings the week of July 23 and a commission order by September 27. 
Given timing, there is subject matter overlap of the rate filing with the merger proceedings. While the merger doesn't address all the rate case items, it does address principle drivers like ROE, merger savings and the roll off of wholesale contracts and production tax credits. 
A couple of items that stand on their own and that will have to be addressed as part of the rate case alone and not part of the merger settlement are putting the Western Plains Wind Farm in rates and implementing the new depreciation rates. 
When the tax law passed, we committed to passing the full benefit to customers, and in January, we began booking that liability. In rates too we're taking the same approach and made the commitment to pass tax benefits to customers sooner than would occur if we just simply operated the annual cost true ups. 
Together, we expect to reflect in rates of about $95 million of annual tax benefits, about $74 million of that is retail rates and $21 million that is formula rates. 
As to merger matters, it's been a busy start to the year and we are glad that we checked off a few more of the merger. In February, we received for approval as filed. In March, the NRC and SEC filed suit leaving just the KCC and the Missouri 
Constructive conversations led to common ground in March when the resettlement of our staff, consumer advocates as many other important intervenors in both states. The settlements provide straightforward mechanics to pass merger statements to customers in all jurisdictions. Not everyone settled, but the settling parties are broad and reflect diverse interests. 
Those electing not to settle include a handful of Kansas industrials a couple of wholesale players and some environmental advocates. 
In Kansas, the settlement calls for upfront bill credits of $30 million right after close plus $45 million more in total to be paid over next 4 years, 2019 through '22 at about $11 million per year. 
Also included for that same period is an earnings sharing -- earnings review and sharing program. It allows for sharing incremental merger benefits if returns exceed authorized returns, but also presents us the opportunity to earned back annual bill credits just mentioned before any sharing kicks in. We'll calculate this annually based on a 9.3% ROE and about a 50% equity ratio. 
The bill credits just mentioned were combined company commitments for both companies in Kansas. The slides we posted last night detail the specific Westar customer benefit. 
As I mentioned, given timing, there is plenty of cross-reference between the Kansas merger settlement and the rate review. This nexus provides some clarity to both customers and shareholders. For example, in the Westar rate review, we have a couple of large items that need to be reflected in rates. After years of providing value to our customers in the form of retail rate offset, a large wholesale contract and our initial wind tax credits both come to an end early next year. That need to be reflected in rates. 
Additionally, to enable the merger rate moratorium, we needed some assurance regarding ROE. The parties to the settlement agreed to support the recovery of revenue related to both expiring wholesale contracts and the expiring production tax credits as well as supporting a 9.3% ROE in the upcoming rate review. 
Annually, the Kansas settlement also allows the utilities to recover $30 million in transition cause over the 10-year period. 
Going the other direction, we will $30 million annually of merger savings back into Kansas rates, that's $23 million for Westar and $7 million for Kansas These locked in customer benefits demonstrate our confidence in the merger savings and the unequivocal value of the merger in keeping Kansas energy costs competitive. We'll implement rates in 2 stages. 
As filed, and I'm only talking about the rate case this first part. As filed, the first phase will be $2 million decrease in September. The second stage was filed to be a $54 million step up in about February of next year. So all told, as filed, it's a net $52 million or 2.6% increase.  But that's before the additional merger savings clearly that I just mentioned. 
If the commission deducts the merger settlement, including the cross-references to the rate review mentioned earlier, the revenue requirement would be reduced by $35 million, taking the net increase from $52 million to just about $17 million or so. 
We expect the KCC to issue its merger order no later than June 5 and we've asked them to consider May 29, which would allow for a much easier month end accounting. 
Moving to Missouri. In January, we'll be settlement with 3 intervenors, including the MPSC staff. In March, we expanded the settlement to include in the Office of Public Council and another party. Similar to Kansas, the Missouri settlement will include upfront bill credits, impeded merger savings in the initial KCPL Missouri rate reviews and allow recovery of $17 million of transition costs over 10-year period. 
Last month, all 4 Missouri commissioners that were present for an open meeting indicated their informal support for the merger settlement. While the timing of an order is still unknown, we believe Missouri will accept the stipulation of settlement and approve the merger close to the timing in Kansas. 
In neither state we've been debating whether we meet the merger standards, I just ran through some of the numbers, it's overwhelmingly beneficial to our customers. Virtually all parties agree that bringing these 2 companies together unlocks a lot of value. So naturally, discussions are more focused on who gets what, when, and doing so in a fair manner that reflects ratemaking difference in timing differences between the 2 states. These settlements among diverse parties do just that, effectively locking in a plan to keep our rates competitive. 
To produce these savings,  of course, the settlement still require formal approval from both state commissions. Right after that, Terry and the management team are eager and ready to execute to get the. 
And with that, I'll clean things over to Tony."

Last night, we announced first quarter EPS of $0.42 in line with a year ago. Gross margin decreased slightly from the same period last year. Retail sales were up nicely, about 5% and those effects were offset by our commitment to give tax benefits back to our customers. This amount, the $19 million regulator liability is mostly offset by lower tax expense, but due to a timing difference in the refund calculation, there is a slight impact to the bottom line. This caused $0.02 drag to EPS this quarter, and by year-end, we expect to the bottom line impact to be generally neutral, but ultimately determined by actual results. 
With a return to normal temperatures this quarter, residential and commercial sales were up about 9% and 5%, respectively. We estimate weather helped us to the tune of $0.01 compared to last year and $0.06 compared to last year. 
The higher sales were offset by increased O&M of $4.5 million and higher interest expense of approximately $3 million resulting from having issued $300 million of long-term debt and 3.1% in March of last year. 
In that same month last year, Western Plains went into service, which means we saw the full effect of the new wind farm that is not reflected in rates. O&M and expense is where higher as a result, but higher cost for our mostly offset by lower income tax expense from the production tax credits. And of course, there was a nice fuel cost offset for our customers. 
We received no COLI income for this quarter, which is no different than first quarter last year. As a reminder, we have $20 million of COLI benefits in 2018 plan. If you that evenly throughout the year, receiving 0 COLI this quarter cost us $0.03 when compared to plan. 
On to a broader economic update. As we said many times, Kansas the boom or bust. We continue to see steady growth as evidenced by the uptick in industrial throughout our service territories in the past few years. After increasing 3.5% last year were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. 
Unemployment is hovering just shy of 3.5% as we are accustomed to below the national average. 
Let me finish with a few words on the combined company's outlook. Many of you have asked about our financial and how they stack up with settlements in both states. We still plan to repurchase approximately 60 million shares over the 2 years or so after merger close. This puts us in a favorable position compared to many of our peers that are issuing shares because of tax reform. We are still targeting EPS CAGR of 6% to 8% based on Westar's 2016 EPS of $2.43. Our plan allowed for dividend growth alongside earnings a while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio. 
Our ability to deliver this value is enabled by a strong balance sheet and solid investment grade credit profile. Tax reform hasn't changed our plans, but it does maybe take away a credit otherwise could have occurred. Cash flow, credit metrics and earnings will be greatly enhanced due to the hundreds of millions of dollars in efficiencies created by combining these 2 companies. 
In summary, our investment thesis is simple. Due to benefits of the merger, we'll be buyback shares instead of issuing like many others and we plan to deliver top quartile EPS and dividend growth without leaning on the backs of our customers to do so. 
With that, we look forward to your question. Members of the media, we in invite you to contact at at 785-575-8089, if you have questions.

Last night, we announced first quarter EPS of $0.42, in line with a year ago. Gross margin decreased slightly from the same period last year. Retail sales were up nicely, about 5%, and those effects are offset by our commitment to give tax benefits back to our customers. This amount, the $19 million regulatory liability, is mostly offset by lower tax expense, but due to a timing difference in the refund calculation, there is a slight impact to the bottom line. This caused a $0.02 drag to EPS this quarter, and by year-end, we expect the bottom line impact to be generally neutral, but ultimately determined by actual results.
With the return to normal temperatures this quarter, residential and commercial sales are up about 9% and 5%, respectively. We estimate weather helped us to the tune of $0.01 compared to normal and $0.06 compared to last year.
The higher sales were offset by increased O&M of $4.5 million and higher interest expense of approximately $3 million, resulting from having issued $300 million of long-term debt at 3.1% in March of last year.
In that same month last year, Western Plains went into service, which means we saw the full effect of the new wind farm that is yet not reflected in rates. O&M and depreciation expense were higher as a result, but higher costs were mostly offset by lower income tax expense from the production tax credits. And of course, there was also a nice fuel cost offset for our customers.
We received no COLI income for this quarter, which is no different than first quarter last year. As a reminder, we have $20 million of COLI benefit in our 2018 plan. If you were to spread that evenly throughout the year, receiving 0 COLI this quarter cost us $0.03 when compared to planned.
On to a broader economic update. As we said many times, Kansas doesn't typically boom or bust, but we continue to see steady growth as evidenced by the uptake in industrial sales throughout our service territory the past few years. After increasing 3.5% last year, they again were up 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Unemployment is hovering just shy of 3.5%, and as we are accustomed to, below the national average.
Let me finish with a few words on the combined company's outlook. Many of you have asked about our financial projections and how they stack up with settlements in both states. We still plan to repurchase approximately 60 million shares over the 2 years or so after merger close. This puts us in a favorable position compared to many of our peers that are issuing shares because of tax reform. We are still targeting an EPS CAGR of 6% to 8% based on Westar's 2016 EPS of $2.43. Our plan allows for dividend growth alongside earnings while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio.
Our ability to deliver this value is enabled by a strong balance sheet and solid investment grade credit profile. Tax reform hasn't changed our plans, but it does maybe take away a credit positive that otherwise could have occurred.
Cash flow, credit metrics and earnings will be greatly enhanced due to the hundreds of millions of dollars in efficiencies created by combining these 2 companies.
In summary, our investment thesis is simple. Due to benefits of the merger, we'll be buying back shares instead of issuing like many others, and we plan to deliver top quartile EPS and dividend growth without leaning on the backs of our customers to do so.
With that, we look forward to your question. Members of the media, we invite you to contact Gina Penzig at (785) 575-8089, if you have questions.

Last night, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.42 per share, solid results and flat to a year ago in part due to the new tax law. Tony will give you a full download on the quarter in just a bit.
We've got a busy and effective start to the year on the regulatory front as we also keep our eye on financial and operating results alongside focusing on the future with the merger.
Let me give you a quick update on our business before I touch on regulatory and merger matters. Operations started the year strong carrying forward the momentum from record-setting reliability last year. Year-to-date, we operated our power plants with first quartile reliability, even as we work our way through typical planned spring maintenance.
Wolf Creek came off-line in late March for its regular 18-month refueling. This was after almost 500 days of run since the last refueling in the fall of '16, no downtime. We expect the plant to be back from refueling in just a few days.
First quarter capacity factor of our wind portfolio was just a few basis points shy of 50% and remarkably only a couple of percentage points lower than our base-load coal plants, which we've now adapted to flex and cycle with market opportunities.
In the last decade, we've grown our wind portfolio to more than 1,700 megawatt. That puts us on pace to reach an impressive milestone. By midyear, we'll have produced over 25 million renewable megawatt hours, that's equivalent of about a 500-megawatt base-load coal plant operating for the same span or a carbon reduction equivalent of over 28 million tons.
The combination of our renewable and nuclear generation supplied enough emission-free energy to meet 2/3 of our retail customers' needs for the quarter. Renewables alone can meet 1/3 of those needs annually and has allowed us to reduce carbon emissions by around 40% from our '05 levels.
Before turning to the merger, let me give you a rate update. In January, we filed our annual FERC transmission formula rate update. In February, we filed the companion retail update, which took effect April 1. For the year, rate updates increased transmission margin by about $4 million. Also, in February, we filed with the KCC for a general rate review. The commission set a procedural schedule that calls for a settlement conference on July 9, evidentiary hearings the week of July 23 and a commission order by September 27.
Given timing, there is subject-matter overlap of the rate filing with the merger proceedings. While the merger doesn't address all the rate case items, it does address principle drivers, like ROE, merger savings and the roll off of wholesale contracts and production tax credits. A couple of items that stand on their own and that will have to be addressed as part of the rate case alone and not part of the merger settlement are putting the Western Plains Wind Farm in rates and implementing new depreciation rates.
When the tax law passed, we committed to passing the full benefit to customers, and in January, we began booking that liability. In FERC rates too, we're taking the same approach and made the commitment to pass tax benefits to customers sooner than would occur if we just simply operated the annual cost true-ups.
Together, we expect to reflect in rates about $95 million of annual tax benefits, about $74 million of that is retail rates and $21 million of that is FERC formula rates.
As to merger matters, it's been a busy start to the year, and we're glad we've checked off a few more of the merger to-do items. In February, we received FERC approval as filed. In March, the NRC and FCC filed suit, leaving just the KCC and the Missouri PSC.
Constructive conversations led to common ground in March when we reached settlements with staff, consumer advocates and many other important interveners in both states. The settlements provide straightforward mechanics to pass merger savings to customers in all jurisdictions. Not everyone settled, but the settling parties are broad and reflect diverse interests. Those electing not to settle include a handful of Kansas industrials, a couple of wholesale players and some environmental advocates.
In Kansas, the settlement calls for upfront bill credits of $30 million right after close, plus $45 million more in total to be paid ratably over the next 4 years, 2019 through '22, at about $11 million per year.
Also included for that same period is an earnings sharing -- earnings review and sharing program. It allows for sharing incremental merger benefits if earned returns exceed authorized returns, but also presents us the opportunity to earn back annual bill credits just mentioned before any sharing kicks in. We'll calculate this annually based on a 9.3% ROE and about a 50% equity ratio.
The bill credits just mentioned were combined company commitments for both companies in Kansas. The slides we posted last night detail the specific Westar customer benefits.
As I mentioned, given timing, there is plenty of cross-reference between the Kansas merger settlement and the rate review. This nexus provides some clarity to both customers and shareholders. For example, in the Westar rate review, we have a couple of large items that need to be reflected in rates. After years of providing value to our customers in the form of retail rate offsets, a large wholesale contract and our initial wind tax credits both come to an end early next year and need to be reflected in the rates.
Additionally, to enable the merger rate moratorium, we needed some assurance regarding ROE. The parties to the settlement agreed to support the recovery of revenue related to both the expiring wholesale contracts and the expiring production tax credits as well as supporting a 9.3% ROE in the upcoming rate review.
Annually, the Kansas settlement also allows the utilities to recover $30 million in transition cost over the 10-year period.
Going the other direction, we'll impute $30 million annually of merger savings back into Kansas rates. That's $23 million for Westar and $7 million for Kansas KCP&L. These locked-in customer benefits demonstrate our confidence in the merger savings and the unequivocal value of the merger in keeping Kansas energy costs competitive.
We'll implement rates in 2 stages. As filed -- and I'm only talking about the rate case this first part. As filed, the first stage will be a $2 million decrease in September. The second stage was filed to be a $54 million step-up in about February of next year. So all told, as filed, it's a net $52 million or 2.6% increase. But that's before the additional merger savings credit that I just mentioned. If the commission adopts the merger settlement, including the cross-references to the rate review mentioned earlier, the revenue requirement would be reduced by $35 million, taking the net increase from $52 million to just about $17 million or so.
We expect the KCC to issue its merger order no later than June 5, and we've asked them to consider May 29, which would allow for a much easier month-end accounting.
Moving to Missouri. In January, we resettlement with 3 interveners, including the MPSC staff. In March, we expanded this settlement to include the Office of Public Council and another party. Similar to Kansas, the Missouri settlement will include upfront bill credits, imputed merger savings in the initial KCPL Missouri rate reviews and allow recovery of $17 million of transition costs over a 10-year period.
Last month, all 4 Missouri commissioners that were present for an open meeting indicated their informal support for the merger settlement. While the timing of an order is still unknown, we believe Missouri will accept the stipulation of the settlement and approve the merger close to the timing in Kansas.
In neither state have we been debating whether we meet the merger standards. I just ran through some of the numbers. It's overwhelmingly beneficial to our customers. Virtually all parties agreed that bringing these 2 companies together unlocks a lot of value. So naturally, discussions are more focused on who gets what, when and doing so in a fair manner that reflects rate-making difference and timing differences between the 2 states. These settlements among diverse parties do just that, effectively locking in a plan to keep our rates competitive.
To produce these savings, of course, the settlements still require formal approval from both state commissions. Right after that, Terry and the management team are eager and ready to execute to get them.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Tony."

We expect the KCC to issue its merger order no later than June 5, and we've asked them to consider May 29, which would allow for a much easier month-end accounting.
Moving to Missouri. In January, we resettlement with 3 interveners, including the MPSC staff. In March, we expanded this settlement to include the Office of Public Council and another party. Similar to Kansas, the Missouri settlement will include upfront bill credits, imputed merger savings in the initial KCPL Missouri rate reviews and allow recovery of $17 million of transition costs over a 10-year period.
Last month, all 4 Missouri commissioners that were present for an open meeting indicated their informal support for the merger settlement. While the timing of an order is still unknown, we believe Missouri will accept the stipulation of the settlement and approve the merger close to the timing in Kansas.
In neither state have we been debating whether we meet the merger standards. I just ran through some of the numbers. It's overwhelmingly beneficial to our customers. Virtually all parties agreed that bringing these 2 companies together unlocks a lot of value. So naturally, discussions are more focused on who gets what, when and doing so in a fair manner that reflects rate-making difference and timing differences between the 2 states. These settlements among diverse parties do just that, effectively locking in a plan to keep our rates competitive.
To produce these savings, of course, the settlements still require formal approval from both state commissions. Right after that, Terry and the management team are eager and ready to execute to get them.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Tony."

Last night, we announced first quarter EPS of $0.42, in line with a year ago. Gross margin decreased slightly from the same period last year. Retail sales were up nicely, about 5%, and those effects are offset by our commitment to give tax benefits back to our customers. This amount, the $19 million regulatory liability, is mostly offset by lower tax expense, but due to a timing difference in the refund calculation, there is a slight impact to the bottom line. This caused a $0.02 drag to EPS this quarter, and by year-end, we expect the bottom line impact to be generally neutral, but ultimately determined by actual results.
With the return to normal temperatures this quarter, residential and commercial sales are up about 9% and 5%, respectively. We estimate weather helped us to the tune of $0.01 compared to normal and $0.06 compared to last year.
The higher sales were offset by increased O&M of $4.5 million and higher interest expense of approximately $3 million, resulting from having issued $300 million of long-term debt at 3.1% in March of last year.
In that same month last year, Western Plains went into service, which means we saw the full effect of the new wind farm that is yet not reflected in rates. O&M and depreciation expense were higher as a result, but higher costs were mostly offset by lower income tax expense from the production tax credits. And of course, there was also a nice fuel cost offset for our customers.
We received no COLI income for this quarter, which is no different than first quarter last year. As a reminder, we have $20 million of COLI benefit in our 2018 plan. If you were to spread that evenly throughout the year, receiving 0 COLI this quarter cost us $0.03 when compared to planned.
On to a broader economic update. As we said many times, Kansas doesn't typically boom or bust, but we continue to see steady growth as evidenced by the uptake in industrial sales throughout our service territory the past few years. After increasing 3.5% last year, they again were up 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Unemployment is hovering just shy of 3.5%, and as we are accustomed to, below the national average.
Let me finish with a few words on the combined company's outlook. Many of you have asked about our financial projections and how they stack up with settlements in both states. We still plan to repurchase approximately 60 million shares over the 2 years or so after merger close. This puts us in a favorable position compared to many of our peers that are issuing shares because of tax reform. We are still targeting an EPS CAGR of 6% to 8% based on Westar's 2016 EPS of $2.43. Our plan allows for dividend growth alongside earnings while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio.
Our ability to deliver this value is enabled by a strong balance sheet and solid investment grade credit profile. Tax reform hasn't changed our plans, but it does maybe take away a credit positive that otherwise could have occurred.
Cash flow, credit metrics and earnings will be greatly enhanced due to the hundreds of millions of dollars in efficiencies created by combining these 2 companies.
In summary, our investment thesis is simple. Due to benefits of the merger, we'll be buying back shares instead of issuing like many others, and we plan to deliver top quartile EPS and dividend growth without leaning on the backs of our customers to do so.
With that, we look forward to your question. Members of the media, we invite you to contact Gina Penzig at (785) 575-8089, if you have questions.

First, let me start off by saying it is great to be joining to today as the new Evergy. Our name brand or blend of the words ever and energy, conveying our proud history as a reliable source of energy for our communities we serve and our vision to continue far into the future. 
We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintaining competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns. 
we were persistent in signing the way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path. 
Now onto the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remain focused, never took their eye off the ball while running our business. With transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We ran into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. 
Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in. 
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. Merger settlement in Kansas cross referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains and expiring wholesale contracts. 
In our filing, we've requested the wind farm and the expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount and if we had used traditional rate-making, the customer because over 20 years, rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade. 
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September, and again, in January of next year. 
In the settlement, full revenue increase request for this contract will flow-through our fuel cost when the wholesale contract expires in early January for moving the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. 
These constructive solutions for large discrete items create a balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers. All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. The approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27. 
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by the settlement especially as we transition into Web-based rates and adjustment payout period changes for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement create several new rate design solutions for customers and demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate plus. Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. Request reflects in rates in annual savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update our retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. 
Schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3. And settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order in new rates effective around year-end. 
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates of the benefits with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedules calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and order date in late November. 
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was signed by the house signed by Governor in June and became a lower. This bill is a culmination of stakeholders forward thinking to reform Missouri's 100 -year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable, predictable, addresses regulatory lag from investment and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system mobility, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable updates before hanging things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy. 
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power of our retail customers need for clean, carbon-free energy sources. About 1/3 of this power will soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. 
Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables from our retiring end of life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we would have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas. 
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade. 
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with the regulators to find ways to of our clean energy resources to customers. In July, KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory. 
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 3,300-megawatt wind farm, which will be developed in County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020. 
As renewable demand grows, we can and incremental wind and solar projects with properties easy approval. This opportunity is another of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities. 
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share purchases. We're pleased to report earlier this month our board increased dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis upon the announcement of merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile and in cash puts us in a position to strategically balance our capital structure. We're planning to execute a share repurchase program will continue to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability of our customer deserve. 
Our commitment for to no rate reviews next 45 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk of that opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated one-time items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which excludes nonrecurring merger-related items income and compares results of Evergy, as if we were formed on January 1, 2017. 
As detailed on the slide, second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers of the increase included $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger, increased sales due probably to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18 offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the plant shutdown of the Westar plans later this year, a portion of annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral. 
After-tax, merger-related causes that were excluded from a pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger. 
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar deferred income tax reevaluation based on a new composite tax rate, increased sales due to favorable weather, which we helped about $0.25, offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the plant shutdown of the Westar plant, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral. 
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger close, whereas, pro forma includes them for the whole period. 
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rate range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continues to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. 
Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years. 
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period of last year, increases have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date. 
Industrials were slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see whether normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth. 
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. Remaining on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased dividend $0.46 or $1.84 annualized and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident our plan to execute the merger buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remained on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's. Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position to allow us to rebalance of our capital structure, while we haven't started a buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both the and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for deliberate and steady pace to rebalance a capital structure will be an intent to an average of repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discussion. A cadence of number of shares of the parties in each period will depend on many factors. We will report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents. 
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking our guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of your 2018 guidance. And given that this KCPL, GMO rate reviews aren't schedule to include until year-end, we most likely 2019 guidance along with updated projections on our fourth quarter and year-end call next February. 
With that, turn the call back to over to Terry."

And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on most transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L.

But first, let me start off by saying it's great to be joining today as the new Evergy. Our name and brand are a blend of the words ever and energy, conveying our proud history as a reliable source of energy for our communities we serve and our vision to continue far into the future.
We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintaining competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns.
We are -- we were persistent in finding a way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path.
Now on to the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remained focused, never took their eye off the ball running our business. With the transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We run into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in.
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. The merger settlement in Kansas cross-referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty teed up settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions, like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains, and expiring wholesale contracts.
In our filing, we requested the wind farm and expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount as if we had used traditional rate making with smooth customer costs over 20 years rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade.
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue, and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September and again in January of next year. In the settlement, the full revenue increase request for this contract will flow through our fuel costs when the wholesale contract expires in early January removing the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. These constructive solutions for large discrete items create a balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers.
All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. Approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27.
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by this settlement, especially as we transition into base rate adjustment payout period in Kansas for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement creates several new rate design solutions for customers and sets the demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate class.
Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. The request reflects in rates the annual tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. The schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3, and settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order and new rates effective around year-end.
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates the benefit associated with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedule calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and an order date in late November.
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was passed by the house, signed by the Governor in June and became law. This bill is the accumulation -- culmination of stakeholders forward-thinking to reform Missouri's 100-year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable and predictable, addresses regulatory lag from system investments and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system reliability, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable update before hanging things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy.
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power our retail customers need from clean, carbon-free energy sources. Nearly 1/3 of this power will soon become -- or soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables while retiring end-of-life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we will have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas.
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade.
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with regulators to find ways to offer clean energy resources to customers. In July, the KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory.
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 30 -- 300-megawatt Soldier Creek Wind Farm, which will be developed in Nemaha County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020.
As renewable demand grows, we can add incremental wind or solar projects with proper KCC approval. This opportunity is another example of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities.
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near-term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share purchases. Pleased to report earlier this month our board increased the dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis consistent with the commitment we made upon announcement of the merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile plus $1.25 billion cash puts us in position to strategically rebalance our capital structure. We plan to execute the share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability that our customers deserve.
Our commitment to no rate reviews for the next 4 to 5 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk with that opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."
283024,574615192,1528852,"Evergy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Evergy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated onetime items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and compares results of Evergy as if we were formed on January 1, 2017.
As detailed on the slide, the second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers that increase -- some of the drivers of the increase included a $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes, based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger; increased sales due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18; offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants later this year, a portion of the annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral.
After-tax, merger-related costs that were excluded from the pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million. Also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger.
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate; increased sales due to favorable weather, which we estimate helped about $0.25; offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral.
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger closed, whereas pro forma includes them for the whole period.
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rates range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continue to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate markets that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years.
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period last year. Increased sales have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date.
Industrials although slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see weather normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. We remain on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% annual growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased year dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 annualized, and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident in our plan to execute the merger savings and buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remain on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's.
Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position allow us to rebalance our capital structure. While we haven't started the buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both a programmatic and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for a deliberate and steady pace to rebalance the capital structure. We're being intent to dollar-cost average of the repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discretion. The cadence of number of shares we purchase in each period will depend on many factors. We will report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents.
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking around guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of the year 2018 guidance. And given that the KCPL and GMO rate reviews aren't scheduled to include until year-end, we most likely announce 2019 guidance along with updated projections on our fourth quarter and year-end call next February.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on was transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L.

But first, let me start off by saying it's great to be joining today as the new Evergy. Our name and brand are a blend of the words ever and energy, conveying our proud history as a reliable source of energy for our communities we serve and our vision to continue far into the future.
We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintaining competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns.
We are -- we were persistent in finding a way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path.
Now on to the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remained focused, never took their eye off the ball on running our business. With the transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We run into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in.
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. The merger settlement in Kansas cross-referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty teed up settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions, like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains, and expiring wholesale contracts.
In our filing, we requested the wind farm and expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount as if we had used traditional rate making with smooth customer costs over 20 years rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade.
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue, and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September and again in January of next year. In the settlement, the full revenue increase request for this contract will flow through our fuel costs when the wholesale contract expires in early January removing the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. These constructive solutions for large discrete items create balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers.
All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. Approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27.
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by this settlement, especially as we transition into base rate adjustment payout period in Kansas for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement creates several new rate design solutions for customers and sets the demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate class.
Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. The request reflects in rates the annual tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. The schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3, and settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order and new rates effective around year-end.
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates the benefit associated with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedule calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and an order date in late November.
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was passed by the house, signed by the Governor in June and became law. This bill is the cumulation -- culmination of stakeholders forward-thinking to reform Missouri's 100-year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable and predictable, addresses regulatory lag from system investments and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system reliability, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable update before handing things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy.
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power our retail customers need from clean, carbon-free energy sources. Nearly 1/3 of this power will soon become -- or soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables while retiring end-of-life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we will have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas.
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade.
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with regulators to find ways to offer clean energy resources to customers. In July, the KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory.
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 30 -- 300-megawatt Soldier Creek Wind Farm, which will be developed in Nemaha County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020.
As renewable demand grows, we can add incremental wind, our Soldier projects with proper KCC approval. This opportunity is another example of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities.
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near-term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share repurchases. Pleased to report earlier this month our board increased the dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis consistent with the commitment we made upon announcement of the merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile plus $1.25 billion cash puts us in position to strategically rebalance our capital structure. We plan to execute the share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability that our customers deserve.
Our commitment to no rate reviews for the next 4 to 5 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk with that opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."
283024,574615192,1538131,"Evergy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Evergy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated onetime items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and compares results of Evergy as if we were formed on January 1, 2017.
As detailed on the slide, the second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers that increase -- some of the drivers of the increase included a $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes, based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger; increased sales due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18; offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants later this year, a portion of the annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral.
After-tax, merger-related costs that were excluded from the pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million. Also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger.
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate; increased sales due to favorable weather, which we estimate helped about $0.25; offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral.
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger closed, whereas pro forma includes them for the whole period.
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rates range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continue to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate markets that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years.
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period last year. Increased sales have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date.
Industrials are slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see weather normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. We remain on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% annual growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased year dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 annualized, and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident in our plan to execute the merger savings and buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remain on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's.
Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position allow us to rebalance our capital structure. While we haven't started the buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both a programmatic and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for a deliberate and steady pace to rebalance the capital structure. We're being intent to dollar-cost average of the repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discretion. The cadence of number of shares we purchase in each period will depend on many factors. We'll report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents.
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking around guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of the year 2018 guidance.

And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on was transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L.

We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintaining competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns.
We are -- we were persistent in finding a way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path.
Now on to the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remained focused, never took their eye off the ball on running our business. With the transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We run into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in.
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. The merger settlement in Kansas cross-referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty teed up settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions, like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains, and expiring wholesale contracts.
In our filing, we requested the wind farm and expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount as if we had used traditional rate making with smooth customer costs over 20 years rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade.
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue, and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September and again in January of next year. In the settlement, the full revenue increase request for this contract will flow through our fuel costs when the wholesale contract expires in early January removing the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. These constructive solutions for large discrete items create balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers.
All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. Approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27.
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by this settlement, especially as we transition into base rate adjustment payout period in Kansas for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement creates several new rate design solutions for customers and sets the demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate class.
Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. The request reflects in rates the annual tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. The schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3, and settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order and new rates effective around year-end.
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates the benefit associated with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedule calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and an order date in late November.
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was passed by the house, signed by the Governor in June and became law. This bill is the cumulation -- culmination of stakeholders forward-thinking to reform Missouri's 100-year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable and predictable, addresses regulatory lag from system investments and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system reliability, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable update before handing things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy.
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power our retail customers need from clean, carbon-free energy sources. Nearly 1/3 of this power will soon become -- or soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables while retiring end-of-life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we will have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas.
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade.
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with regulators to find ways to offer clean energy resources to customers. In July, the KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory.
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 30 -- 300-megawatt Soldier Creek Wind Farm, which will be developed in Nemaha County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020.
As renewable demand grows, we can add incremental wind, our Soldier projects with proper KCC approval. This opportunity is another example of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities.
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near-term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share repurchases. Pleased to report earlier this month our board increased the dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis consistent with the commitment we made upon announcement of the merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile plus $1.25 billion cash puts us in position to strategically rebalance our capital structure. We plan to execute the share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability that our customers deserve.
Our commitment to no rate reviews for the next 4 to 5 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk with that opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."
283024,574615192,1538140,"Evergy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Evergy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated onetime items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and compares results of Evergy as if we were formed on January 1, 2017.
As detailed on the slide, the second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers that increase -- some of the drivers of the increase included a $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes, based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger; increased sales due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18; offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants later this year, a portion of the annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral.
After-tax, merger-related costs that were excluded from the pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million. Also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger.
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate; increased sales due to favorable weather, which we estimate helped about $0.25; offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral.
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger closed, whereas pro forma includes them for the whole period.
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rates range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continue to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate markets that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years.
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period last year. Increased sales have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date.
Industrials are slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see weather normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. We remain on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% annual growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased year dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 annualized, and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident in our plan to execute the merger savings and buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remain on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's.
Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position allow us to rebalance our capital structure. While we haven't started the buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both a programmatic and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for a deliberate and steady pace to rebalance the capital structure. We're being intent to dollar-cost average of the repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discretion. The cadence of number of shares we purchase in each period will depend on many factors. We'll report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents.
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking around guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of the year 2018 guidance. And given that the KCPL and GMO rate reviews aren't scheduled to include until year-end, we most likely announce 2019 guidance along with updated projections on our fourth quarter and year-end call next February.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

We had rate cases, and we suffered some of that lag, and we worked through it. But yes, it provides the stability to continue to spend those dollars. Couple of things happen. Number one, the PISA itself allows us to mitigate and to a large part, eliminate lag associated with much of our ongoing spin that we need and will continue to do for reliability and maintenance and technology upgrade for our customers. And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on was transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L. So you combine that with PISA providing protection, if you will, for that lag that would traditionally have happened between rate cases, and it really provides a level of stability and ongoing ability to deliver our shareholder returns on an annual basis."

But first, let me start off by saying it's great to be joining today as the new Evergy. Our name and brand are a blend of the words ever and energy, conveying our proud history as a reliable source of energy for our communities we serve and our vision to continue far into the future.
We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintain competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns.
We are -- we were persistent in finding a way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path.
Now on to the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remained focused, never took their eye off the ball on running our business. With the transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We've run into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in.
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. The merger settlement in Kansas cross-referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty teed up settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions, like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains, and expiring wholesale contracts.
In our filing, we requested the wind farm and expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount as if we had used traditional rate making with smooth customer costs over 20 years rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade.
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue, and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September and again in January of next year. In the settlement, the full revenue increase request for this contract will flow through our fuel costs when the wholesale contract expires in early January removing the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. These constructive solutions for large discrete items create balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers.
All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. Approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27.
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by this settlement, especially as we transition into base rate adjustment payout period in Kansas for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement creates several new rate design solutions for customers and sets the demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate class.
Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. The request reflects in rates the annual tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. The schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3, and settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order and new rates effective around year-end.
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates the benefit associated with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedule calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and an order date in late November.
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was passed by the house, signed by the Governor in June and became law. This bill is the cumulation -- culmination of stakeholders forward-thinking to reform Missouri's 100-year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable and predictable, addresses regulatory lag from system investments and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system reliability, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable update before handing things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy.
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power our retail customers need from clean, carbon-free energy sources. Nearly 1/3 of this power will soon become -- or soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables while retiring end-of-life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we will have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas.
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade.
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with regulators to find ways to offer clean energy resources to customers. In July, the KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory.
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 30 -- 300-megawatt Soldier Creek Wind Farm, which will be developed in Nemaha County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020.
As renewable demand grows, we can add incremental wind, our Soldier projects with proper KCC approval. This opportunity is another example of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities.
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near-term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share repurchases. Pleased to report earlier this month our board increased the dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis consistent with the commitment we made upon announcement of the merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile plus $1.25 billion cash puts us in position to strategically rebalance our capital structure. We plan to execute the share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability that our customers deserve.
Our commitment to no rate reviews for the next 4 to 5 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk with that opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."
283024,574615192,1541247,"Evergy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Evergy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated onetime items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and compares results of Evergy as if we were formed on January 1, 2017.
As detailed on the slide, the second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers that increase -- some of the drivers of the increase included a $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes, based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger; increased sales due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18; offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants later this year, a portion of the annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral.
After-tax, merger-related costs that were excluded from the pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million. Also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger.
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate; increased sales due to favorable weather, which we estimate helped about $0.25; offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral.
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger closed, whereas pro forma includes them for the whole period.
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rates range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continue to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate markets that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years.
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period last year. Increased sales have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date.
Industrials are slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see weather normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. We remain on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% annual growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased year dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 annualized, and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident in our plan to execute the merger savings and buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remain on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's.
Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position allow us to rebalance our capital structure. While we haven't started the buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both a programmatic and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for a deliberate and steady pace to rebalance the capital structure. We've the intent to dollar-cost average of the repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discretion. The cadence of number of shares we purchase in each period will depend on many factors. We'll report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents.
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking around guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of the year 2018 guidance. And given that the KCPL and GMO rate reviews aren't scheduled to conclude until year-end, we most likely announce 2019 guidance along with updated projections on our fourth quarter and year-end call next February.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

Separately, the earnings growth profile as you targeted through '21, fair to say that it is pretty front-end loaded, as you get the benefits of both the synergies and the buyback. But when you look long term, once the buyback is over, let's say, in 2020, what is in your mind the sustainable growth rate for the combined company? I believe, your CapEx plan equates to about a 4% rate-based CAGR. Is that a good sustainable way to think about earnings growth or could earnings growth be greater than that? Any insight into that once the share buyback is behind us?"

Well, the investment thesis that we've laid out is a little unique in buying back the shares and not necessarily driving the rate base up 8% a year and asking for rate increases every other year.

And then on the back-end, even past 2020, we'll still be able to execute on synergies as we combine the 2 companies.

We had rate cases, and we suffered some of that lag, and we worked through it. But yes, it provides the stability to continue to spend those dollars. Couple of things happen. Number one, the PISA itself allows us to mitigate and to a large part, eliminate lag associated with much of our ongoing spend that we need and will continue to do for reliability and maintenance and technology upgrade for our customers. And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on was transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L. So you combine that with PISA providing protection, if you will, for that lag that would traditionally have happened between rate cases, and it really provides a level of stability and ongoing ability to deliver our shareholder returns on an annual basis."

But first, let me start off by saying it's great to be joining today as the new Evergy. Our name and brand are a blend of the words ever and energy, conveying our proud history as a reliable source of energy for our communities we serve and our vision to continue far into the future.
We've served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than a century. Together, we're more efficient allowing us to continue providing excellent customer service, maintain competitive rates and provide attractive total shareholder returns.
We are -- we were persistent in finding a way to make this merger happen because we were extremely confident in the value of this combination. We appreciate that you also recognize this value, and thank you for your patience and confidence throughout this unique path.
Now on to the business update. Last night, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.56 and pro forma EPS of $0.90, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related expenses. The ability to deliver solid financial results amongst merger distraction is a testament to our team. Our employees remained focused, never took their eye off the ball on running our business. With the transaction behind us, we're putting into motion our merger integration plans and executing on the next regulatory priorities. We've run into no surprises since closing and remaining on track to deliver our earnings and dividend growth targets, while still planning to rebalance our capital structure. Tony will give you the latest on our repurchase buyback plans in a bit, a topic I know many of you are interested in.
Now let me update you on regulatory and legislative priorities, turn to Slide 6. It's been a busy year as we filed rate reviews in all 4 state jurisdictions and devoted significant effort towards successful legislative regulatory form in Missouri. In most recent news, we've reached a nonunanimous settlement with KCC staff, CURB and several other interveners in our Westar rate review. The merger settlement in Kansas cross-referenced the open rate review creating certainty for important items like ROE and merger savings. The certainty teed up settlement conversations focused on more manageable discussions, like appropriate levels of depreciation, how best to recover our newest wind farm, Western Plains, and expiring wholesale contracts.
In our filing, we requested the wind farm and expiring wholesale contracts to be reflected in base rates. As a result of settlement negotiations, we will reflect the wind farm, including return of and return on the investment to a levelized structure. This structure allows us to recover the full amount as if we had used traditional rate making with smooth customer costs over 20 years rather than having the lumpiness of expiring production tax credits after a decade.
Similarly, we requested the expiring wholesale contract be reflected in base rates. This created a timing issue, and we requested a 2-step approach with proposed rate changes in September and again in January of next year. In the settlement, the full revenue increase request for this contract will flow through our fuel costs when the wholesale contract expires in early January removing the need for a 2-step base rate implementation. These constructive solutions for large discrete items create balance to reflect the appropriate cost recovery while stabilizing base rates for our customers.
All in all, the settlement calls for a single $66 million revenue reduction with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of 51.5%. Approximately $75 million impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is also included in the settlement. Rates will become effective upon commission approval, which we expect on September 27.
We're pleased with the value and certainty created by this settlement, especially as we transition into base rate adjustment payout period in Kansas for the next 5 years. Additionally, the settlement creates several new rate design solutions for customers and sets the demand charges for our current residential distribution generation rate class.
Staying on Kansas for a minute, on May 1, we filed a rate review for KCPL, requesting a revenue increase of $16 million. The request reflects in rates the annual tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also update retail rates for several customer experience enhancements, including technology and sustainability initiatives and reflect merger savings. The schedule shows intervener testimony due September 12 and our rebuttal testimony due October 3, and settlement discussion and hearings later in October with a final order and new rates effective around year-end.
Shifting to Missouri rate reviews for KCP&L and GMO. For KCPL, we requested a revenue increase of around $9 million. For GMO, we requested a net revenue decrease of about $2 million. Consistent with the reviews in Kansas, both of these Missouri applications also reflect in rates the benefit associated with the new federal tax law. The combined docket schedule calls for 2 settlement conferences over the next month with evidentiary hearings in mid-September and an order date in late November.
Turning to an update on legislative reform in Missouri. In May, Senate Bill 564 was passed by the house, signed by the Governor in June and became law. This bill is the cumulation -- culmination of stakeholders forward-thinking to reform Missouri's 100-year-old regulatory framework. It offers consumer protections to ensure future energy costs are more stable and predictable, addresses regulatory lag from system investments and creates a more attractive platform to modernize the electric grid. In the near term, it doesn't create a lot of incremental investment for us, but it does allow us to continue spending at an appropriate level to maintain system reliability, while removing barriers that contributed to regulatory lag in the past.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll touch on renewable update before handing things over to Tony. Over the last decade, we've transitioned our generation portfolio to capitalize on renewable resources as part of our long-term sustainability strategy.
By 2020, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by over 40% from 2010 levels. Our diverse generation fleet now provides half the power our retail customers need from clean, carbon-free energy sources. Nearly 1/3 of this power will soon become -- or soon come from renewable resources, making Evergy one of the largest wind energy providers in the nation. Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on adding renewables while retiring end-of-life fossil plants. By the end of 2018, we will have completed the retirement of more than 1,500 megawatts of fossil generation, approximately 800 of coal and 700 of natural gas.
In addition, we continue to add new wind generation with 244 megawatts expected in 2018, 200 megawatts by mid-2019 and 300 megawatts in 2020, resulting in a wind portfolio of over 3,800 megawatts by the end of this decade.
We have deliberately focused on improving the quality of our environment in our region and worked with regulators to find ways to offer clean energy resources to customers. In July, the KCC unlocked a powerful economic development tool that would allow many of our large customers to take advantage of the abundant and affordable renewable energy found in our service territory.
With Westar's new renewable direct tariff, participating businesses will be able to claim a portion of their energy needs for 20 years from the 30 -- 300-megawatt Soldier Creek Wind Farm, which will be developed in Nemaha County, Kansas and is expected to be in-service by year-end 2020.
As renewable demand grows, we can add incremental wind, our Soldier projects with proper KCC approval. This opportunity is another example of us harvesting Kansas wind to help grow Kansas businesses and communities.
Before turning the call over to Tony, let me remind you of our near-term focus and unique investment thesis. We're targeting top quartile total shareholder return predicated on significant merger savings and share repurchases. Pleased to report earlier this month our board increased the dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 on an annualized basis consistent with the commitment we made upon announcement of the merger. We remain confident in our estimates and are starting to capitalize on our integration plans. Strong balance sheet, solid credit profile plus $1.25 billion cash puts us in position to strategically rebalance our capital structure. We plan to execute the share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business, maintaining the reliability that our customers deserve.
Our commitment to no rate reviews for the next 4 to 5 years allows us to provide an attractive total shareholder returns while significantly reducing the regulatory risk with that opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with the results on Slide 9 of the presentation. Given the messy nature of the merger closing in June and the associated onetime items linked to the transaction, I'll focus primarily on the pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and compares results of Evergy as if we were formed on January 1, 2017.
As detailed on the slide, the second quarter pro forma EPS were $0.90 per share compared to $0.59 a share for the second quarter last year. Some of the drivers that increase -- some of the drivers of the increase included a $0.19 pickup related to the reevaluation of Westar's deferred income taxes, based on Evergy's composite tax rate resulting from the merger; increased sales due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.18; offset by $0.06 of other costs, including inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants later this year, a portion of the annual ongoing bill credits in Kansas and transition costs net of deferral.
After-tax, merger-related costs that were excluded from the pro forma results, but included in GAAP, were about $69 million. Also GAAP earnings only include KCPL and GMO results beginning in June upon closing of the merger.
Moving on year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date pro forma EPS were $1.23 compared to $0.91 a share last year. Variances for the year-to-date results are similar to the quarter drivers and include $0.19 of Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate; increased sales due to favorable weather, which we estimate helped about $0.25; offset by $0.12 of other costs, including the inventory write-offs for the planned shutdown of the Westar plants, the impact of the annual ongoing bill credits and transition costs net of deferral.
For the year, GAAP results include about $69 million of after-tax merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results. Also GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger closed, whereas pro forma includes them for the whole period.
Moving to Slide 11, I'll briefly touch on our local economy. Our customer segment sales are balanced across our service territories after combining the residential, commercial, metropolitan area of KCPL and the steady demand of Westar's industrial base. Unemployment rates range from 3.4% to 3.7% throughout our service territory, continue to trend at being below the national average of 3.8%. Jobs coming to the metro areas continue to provide support to residential real estate markets that have been strong in Kansas City over the past few years.
On a pro forma basis, residential and commercial sales year-to-date are up 18% and 5%, respectively, compared to same period last year. Increased sales have been driven mostly from favorable weather, which when compared to normal, we estimate helped by about $0.22 for the quarter and about $0.23 year-to-date.
Industrials are slightly ahead of expected levels were down about 1% compared to a strong first half last year. On a combined basis, we've seen 29 consecutive quarters of customer growth. Overall, we remain encouraged in the broader economic climate and continue to see weather normalized event of flat to 50 basis points of growth.
I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. We remain on track to deliver our attractive EPS target of 6% to 8% annual growth through 2021. As Terry mentioned, our board recently increased year dividend to $0.46 or $1.84 annualized, and we plan to grow this in line with EPS, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio over time. We are confident in our plan to execute the merger savings and buybacks and happy to see the confidence reflected in recent rating agency reports. Since closing the merger, we've received an upgrade from S&P and remain on stable outlook for both S&P and Moody's.
Our strong investment grade credit profile and cash position allow us to rebalance our capital structure. While we haven't started the buybacks yet, our board has authorized repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock, which we expect to complete by mid-2020. We'll take both a programmatic and opportunistic approach to the repurchases and expect to use a series of transactions over time, including open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. This allows for a deliberate and steady pace to rebalance the capital structure. We've the intent to dollar-cost average of the repurchases over time. Other means could be considered subject to market conditions and management's discretion. The cadence of number of shares we purchase in each period will depend on many factors. We'll report the results of our share repurchases in the appropriate SEC documents.
To finish up, let me briefly update you on our current thinking around guidance and projections. We don't plan to issue balance of the year 2018 guidance. And given that the KCPL and GMO rate reviews aren't scheduled to conclude until year-end, we most likely announce 2019 guidance along with updated projections on our fourth quarter and year-end call next February.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

Number one, the PISA itself allows us to mitigate and to a large part, eliminate lag associated with much of our ongoing spend that we need and will continue to do for reliability and maintenance and technology upgrade for our customers. And then I would say the one thing that we didn't necessarily have legislation on was transmission of property taxes. But I think, going forward, we've seen that those have levelized. The SPP transmission process and property tax increases are not expected to cause the lag they have in the past in KCP&L. So you combine that with PISA providing protection, if you will, for that lag that would traditionally have happened between rate cases, and it really provides a level of stability and ongoing ability to deliver our shareholder returns on an annual basis."

Last night, we reported third quarter GAAP EPS of $1.32 and pro forma EPS of $1.34, which excludes nonrecurring merger-related expenses. Tony will provide you more details in a bit, but I will say the team continues to perform well and delivered solid financial and operational results, while also executing on our integration plans. We continue to focus on the execution of the merger plan, which includes capturing merger savings, delivering on a busy regulatory calendar and rebalancing our capital structure. Last and certainly, not least, is the continued integration of our workforce and cultures. Our team is working well together as we make progress on the successful execution of our plan. We're still targeting net merger savings of $30 million in 2018 and $110 million in 2019. Our achieved merger savings remain on track for the year. We realized savings in several categories, including reduced labor cost and more efficient procurement as we now have a scale of a larger company. We have the gun back office system consolidation efforts, which includes a series of enterprise large projects, associated with combining systems will contribute toward reaching merger savings targets as they wrap up over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 6, I'll give you the latest on our regulatory proceedings. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at active regulatory calendar that included a merger docket and a rate reviews in each of our 4 jurisdictions. While our teams focused nevertheless, was to reach constructive settlements in each docket. Successful settlement in our merger docket jumpstarted many diligent and constructive conversations with stakeholders and rate reviews. We used the merger settlement to achieve rate review settlements in each jurisdiction, going 4 for 4 across Kansas and Missouri. Although, we still need a commission order in one of the dockets, we are happy we've been able to reach settlements with most parties in these cases. This speaks to the constructive regulatory relationships that currently exists in both Kansas and Missouri. So let me give you a little detail on the rate review settlements. I'll start with Westar. In July, we reached agreement with calling for a $66 million revenue decrease with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of approximately 51.5%. It also includes $74 million of annual tax reform benefits for customers and $23 million merger savings benefits. In September, the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the settlement and rates became effective. Staying in Kansas and moving over to KCP&L, in mid-October, we reached the unanimous settlement that calls for an annual revenue decrease of $11 million. It also include 9.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 49.1%. Tax reform benefits were reflected in rates at approximately $37 million annually, along with merger benefits of about $7 million. Unanimous nature of the settlement allowed for a truncated evidence we're hearing -- we are now waiting on commission approval, which we expect in late December. Once the new KCPL rates become effective, the 5-year base rates payout period will start for both Westar and KCPL customers and fulfills our commitment made as part of merger settlement agreement. Switching over to Missouri, where rate reviews for KCPL and GMO are combined into a single docket. Similar to the Kansas cases, we reached agreement with intervenors, allowing us to file settlement in mid-September. It's a black box agreement, so it doesn't outline an ROE or equity ratio. The KCPL case calls for annual revenue decrease of $21 million, including annual tax form benefits of $53 million, the GMO case calls for a decrease of $24 million and includes annual tax reform benefits of $39 million. Last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission accepted the settlement and rates will be effective no later than December 6. Not only do these settlements creates for the next 4 to 5 years, they also modernize rate design and offerings to our customers. We will now have green tariffs of our writers in each of our state jurisdictions that allow us to offer additional to all customers and largest customers and the passion they prefer. It's important not only to meet customers needs, but also continues our momentum in transforming to a cleaner energy mix. Moving to a few legislative topics. As you know, we work with stakeholders in Missouri Legislation passed Senate Bill 564 earlier this year. This new law modernizes the regulatory framework in the state, allowing for rate stability provisions for customers and improve return potential for shareholders, a true win-win for all involved. We expect to let the plan in service accounting, our feature of this bill in the near future. We're still evaluating mechanics and qualifying criteria for investments. We're confident this will allow us to spending at appropriate levels in the state, yet reduce much of regulatory lag that we've experienced historically. What you shouldn't expect, however, is to announce large incremental investment plan offer significant jurisdiction reallocation of capital, which is currently balanced across our jurisdictions. PISA, coupled with merger savings should allow us to more consistently earn our allowed returns in Missouri. We have an improved opportunity to earn returns as we are rebasing property taxes in the current rate reviews and transmission costs have continued to flat. These 2 factors should also help reduce the lag that we've experienced in previous years. Now turning to Slide 7, I'll touch on the latest in our effort to diversify our generation portfolio. As part of our long-term sustainability strategy, we've been focusing on diversifying our generation portfolio, which results in a lower cost fleet and improved emissions profile. A large part of that strategy is retiring traditional fossil plants as they approach the end of the useful life. We've already shut down a few plants this year, and altogether, by the end of the year, we will shut down 800 megawatts of coal, 700 megawatts of natural gas. At our Westar operating company, on October 1, we shut down Energy Center, a small coal plant; and then on November 1, we retired the units at the Evergy energy centers. The merger allows us to shut down these plants, that otherwise would have continued to run. So we've build the cost savings associated with those into our target merger savings. For the larger combined generation portfolio, we can now meet our capacity obligation with and given how attractive wind energy is in the part of our country, we can deliver cheaper, cleaner energy from newer wind farms. Moving to KCP&L, coal units specifically in Montréal plants remain on track, retired by the end of the year. We'll experience cost savings from these plants as well, but since they were scheduled to shut down the merger, the cost savings were not included in our targeted merger savings. Nonetheless, the projected OEM reduction from these will be around $200 million cumulatively over the next 5 years. All of the plants have served our customers well for many years. 1950s, 1960s that last well past original expectations. These retirements make perfect business sense. And they also enable a lower carbon future. Since 2010, we have dramatically shifted of our generation portfolio and over 50% coal now favoring a much more sustainable mix. This paves the way for lower carbon future. At 2020, we will have shut down over 2,200 megawatts end-of-life fossil generation grown our wind portfolio to over 3,800 megawatts and reduced our carbon emissions by more than 40%. You can see a full list of our sustainable initiatives in our recently published environmental, social and governance report, which can be found under the sustainability section of our investor relations website. This is part of our effort to support the broad industry and providing investor with the uniform and consistent ESG data, realizing the template and guidelines. Before turning the call over to Tony, let me point out some additional good news. Last night, we raised the dividend on an indicated annualized rate of $1.90 per share. This increase comes just fine months after the closing the merger, reflecting our board's confidence in our business plan and their understanding of the importance of the dividends of producing an attractive total return. Although, dividend is something the Board looks at quarterly, we expect future annual updates to occur each fall. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, our focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and results Evergy reform on",1089,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, our focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and results Evergy reform on January 1, 2017. The good news is, as we move further away from the transaction close, we should have less merger-related items and eventually more apples-to-apples comparison for GAAP results. Third quarter pro forma EPS were $1.34 compared to $1.19 for the third quarter last year. Drivers included increased sales, due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.11; $0.09 related to tax reform, which represents the difference in obligation rates and actual results of operation, $0.03 of increased O&M due to about $16 million of voluntary severance expenses, which costed us about $0.04, and $0.02 of other costs increased depreciation expense in ongoing credit in Kansas, partially offset by lower number of shares outstanding. GAAP earnings were $1.32 a share or $0.02 lower than pro forma due to merger-related expenses. Combined company retail sales were up about 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable weather, which we estimate helped by $0.06 compared to normal. Residential and commercial sales were both up 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Industrial sales were down about 1%, due primarily to a large margin chemical manufacturing customer returning to normal production levels after having a banner 2017. Absent this 1 customer, the balance of industrial sales were up over 1%. Moving onto year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date, pro forma EPS were $2.55 compared to $2 last year. Some of the drivers include $0.36 from higher sales due primarily to the favorable weather, $0.19 cents for Westar's income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate, $0.08 related to the impact from tax reform, $0.05 of higher O&M, which include -- which includes voluntary severance expense already mentioned as well as planned inventory write-offs from earlier in the year and $0.03 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas. Year-to-date, GAAP results were $2.61 and share and include merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results and reflect lower average shares outstanding. Also, GAAP includes KCPL results for the period post-merger close, whereas pro forma includes for the full period. In the appendix, these included a reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma to further explain our results. From a combined company, year-to-date residential commercial sales were up 11% and 4%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The increased sales were driven mostly by favorable weather, which, when compared to normal, we estimate weather benefit of about $0.29 to year-to-date pro forma results. Industrial sales were down about 1%, again mostly due to a large margin customer I referenced earlier. The economy service territory is moving along quite nicely. Unemployment rates throughout our service territory decreased to about 3.3%, staying below the national average of 3.7%. We are seeing continued expansion in healthcare and business services, causing office vacancies to continue to fall. Industrials have remained steady and growth is showing up in aircraft and fabrication sectors. We've now had 30 consecutive quarters of customer growth and continue to project long-term weather normalized demand growth of flat to 50 basis points. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll give you an update on recent financing activities. At merger close, we had $1.25 million of cash on the balance sheet, pushing our equity ratio at 59%. As part of our efforts to rebalance the capital structure, we initiated share repurchase programs in August. As we discussed in the past, we are targeting the repurchase roughly 60 million shares by mid-year 2020. This will result in a consolidated capital structure, reflecting that of the traditional utility at approximately 50% debt and 50% equity. If you recall on August, I mentioned that we are approaching the buyback at a deliberate and steady pace, focusing on a combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. As you can see on the slide, we did just that, we almost 7 million shares in the quarter in the market during the second half of the quarter. We expect upon completion of ASR this month, the total to be around 9.5 million shares or just shy of 16% of the $60 million share repurchase goal. We expect to keep the same measured approach, dollar cost averaging over time, keeping our foot on the gas and trying how far we've driven each quarter. We use $486 million cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. As we move down the road, we'll run through the cash and holding company debt to repurchase and maintain a balance capital structure. From a timing perspective, we expect this to begin sometime after the first half the year and project around $1.5 million of holding company debt to be issued throughout the duration of the repurchase programs. In time, it could vary and ultimately by share price on the cadence of repurchases. This financing plan consists of what we showed the earlier this year resulted in debt metrics that in range of our current credit ratings. Turning now to financing activity, we recently executed the new $2.5 billion credit facility. This aggregate amount is a $0.25 billion more at the end of stand-alone facilities that which The large capacity increases our liquidity and provides more flexibility as we optimize our financing plans. The agreement also includes adjustable features that will allow us to better manage our capital structure at each entity. I'll wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. In summary, our growth strategy has 3 major drivers. Our recent successful regulatory outcomes, our execution to achieve merger efficiencies and our share repurchases. We made progress on all 3 frons, our active 2018 regulatory calendar is in the home stretch, and once we receive our final approval, we should have very little regulatory overhang for the next few years, which provides increased to both customers and shareholders. These share repurchases and executing on merger saving across our businesses. These items ongoing organic growth plans to support our targeted 6% to 8% EPS growth. As Terry mentioned earlier, we just increased the dividend to an annualized $1.90 a share. We plan to along with earnings, while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio. Consistent with this cadence, we have previously stated that we'll issue 2019 guidance and the updated projections on our year-end call in February. With that I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

Last night, we reported third quarter GAAP EPS of $1.32 and pro forma EPS of $1.34, which excludes nonrecurring merger-related expenses. Tony will provide you more details in a bit, but I will say the team continues to perform well and deliver solid financial and operational results, while also executing on our integration plans. We continue to focus on the execution of the merger plan, which includes capturing merger savings, delivering on a busy regulatory calendar and rebalancing our capital structure. Last and certainly, not least, is the continued integration of our workforce and cultures. Our team is working well together as we make progress on the successful execution of our plan. We're still targeting net merger savings of $30 million in 2018 and $110 million in 2019. Our achieved merger savings remain on track for the year. We realized savings in several categories, including reduced labor cost and more efficient procurement as we now have a scale of a larger company. We have begun back office IT system consolidation efforts, which includes a series of enterprise large projects, savings associated with combining systems will contribute toward reaching merger savings targets as they wrap up over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 6, I'll give you the latest on our regulatory proceedings. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at an active regulatory calendar that included a merger docket and rate reviews in each of our 4 jurisdictions. While a formidable task our teams focus nevertheless, was to reach constructive settlements in each docket. The successful settlement in our merger docket jumpstarted many diligent and constructive conversations with stakeholders and the rate reviews. We used the merger settlement momentum to achieve rate review settlements in each jurisdiction, going 4 for 4 across Kansas and Missouri. Although we still need a commission order in one of the dockets, we are happy we've been able to reach settlements with most parties in these cases. This speaks to the constructive regulatory relationships that currently exist in both Kansas and Missouri. So let me give you a little detail on the rate review settlements. I'll start with Westar. In July, we reached agreement with interveners calling for a $66 million revenue decrease with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of approximately 51.5%. It also included $74 million of annual tax reform benefits for customers and $23 million merger savings benefits. In September, the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the settlement and rates became effective. Staying in Kansas and moving over to KCP&L, in mid-October, we reached a unanimous settlement that calls for an annual revenue decrease of $11 million. It also includes a 9.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 49.1%. Tax reform benefits were reflected in rates at approximately $37 million annually, along with merger benefits of about $7 million. Unanimous nature of the settlement allowed for a truncated evidence rehearing. We are now waiting on commission approval, which we expect in late December. Once the new KCPL rates become effective, the 5-year base rates payout period will start for both Westar and KCPL customers and fulfills our commitment made as part of the merger settlement agreement. Switching over to Missouri, where our rate reviews for KCPL and GMO are combined into a single docket. Similar to the Kansas cases, we reached agreement with intervenors, allowing us to file the settlement in mid-September. It's a black box settlement, so it doesn't outline an ROE or equity ratio. The KCPL case calls for annual revenue decrease of $21 million, including annual tax reform benefits of $53 million. GMO case calls for a decrease of $24 million and includes annual tax reform benefits of $39 million. Last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission accepted the settlement and rates will be effective no later than December 6. Not only do these settlements create certainty for the next 4 to 5 years, they also modernize rate design and offerings to our customers. We will now have green tariffs of renewable writers in each of our state jurisdictions that will allow us to offer additional renewables to all customers and our largest customers and the passion they prefer. It's important not only to meet customers needs but also continues our momentum in transforming to a cleaner energy mix. Moving to a few legislative topics. As you know, we work with stakeholders in Missouri Legislation to pass Senate Bill 564 earlier this year. This new law modernizes the regulatory framework in the state, allowing for rate stability provisions for customers and improve return potential for shareholders, a true win-win for all involved. We expect to elect the plan in service accounting, our PISA feature of this bill in the near future, and we're still evaluating mechanics and qualifying criteria for investments. So confident this will allow us to continue spending at appropriate levels in the state, yet reduce much of the regulatory lag that we've experienced historically. What you shouldn't expect, however, is for us to announce a large incremental investment plan or for a significant jurisdictional reallocation of capital, which is currently balanced across our jurisdictions. PISA, coupled with merger savings should allow us to more consistently earn our allowed returns in Missouri. We have an improved opportunity to earn allowed returns as we are rebasing property taxes in the current rate reviews and transmission costs have continued to flat. These 2 factors should also help reduce the lag that we've experienced in previous years. Now turning to Slide 7, I'll touch on the latest in our effort to diversify our generation portfolio. As part of our long-term sustainability strategy, we've been focusing on diversifying our generation portfolio, which results in a lower cost fleet and improved emissions profile. A large part of that strategy is retiring traditional fossil plants as they approach the end of their useful life. We've already shut down a few plants this year, and altogether, by the end of the year, we will shut down 800 megawatts of coal, 700 megawatts of natural gas. At our Westar operating company, on October 1, we shut down Tecumseh Energy Center, a small coal plant; and then on November 1, we retired the gas steam units at the Murray Gill and Gordon Evans energy centers. The merger allows us to shut down these plants that otherwise would have continued to run. So we've build the cost savings associated with those into our target merger savings. For the larger combined generation portfolio, we can now meet our capacity obligation without them and given how attractive wind energy is in our part of the country, we can deliver cheaper, cleaner energy from newer wind farms. Moving to KCP&L, coal units at the Sibley and Montréal plants remain on track to be retired by the end of the year. We'll experience cost savings from these plants as well, but since they were scheduled to shut down absent the merger, the cost savings were not included in our targeted merger savings. Nonetheless, the projected OEM reduction from these will be around $200 million cumulatively over the next 5 years. All of the plants have served our customers well for many years. They were 1950s and 1960s vintage units that lasted well past original expectations. These retirements make perfect business sense. And they also enable a lower carbon future. Since 2010, we have dramatically shifted our generation portfolio and over 50% coal now favoring a much more sustainable mix. This paves the way for a lower carbon future. By 2020, we will have shut down over 2,200 megawatts end-of-life fossil generation, grown our wind portfolio to over 3,800 megawatts and reduced our carbon emissions by more than 40%. You can see a full list of our sustainable initiatives in our recently published environmental, social and governance report, which can be found under the Sustainability section of our investor relations website. This is part of our effort to support the broad industry and providing investor with uniform and consistent ESG data, utilizing the EEI template and guidelines. Before turning the call over to Tony, let me point out some additional good news. Last night, we raised the dividend on an indicated annualized rate of $1.90 per share. This increase comes just 5 months after the closing the merger, reflecting our board's confidence in our business plan and their understanding of the importance of dividends and producing an attractive total return. Although dividend is something the Board looks at quarterly, we expect future annual updates to occur each fall. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and paired results as if Evergy reformed on January 1, 2017. The good news is, as we move further away from the transaction close, we should have less merger-related items and eventually more apples-to-apples comparison for GAAP results. Third quarter pro forma EPS were $1.34 compared to $1.19 for the third quarter last year. Drivers included increased sales, due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.11; $0.09 related to tax reform, which represents the difference in our refund obligation rates and actual results of operations; $0.03 of increased O&M due to about $16 million of voluntary severance expenses, which costed us about $0.04; and $0.02 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas, partially offset by lower number of shares outstanding. GAAP earnings were $1.32 a share or $0.02 lower than pro forma due to merger-related expenses. Combined company retail sales were up about 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable weather, which we estimate helped by $0.06 compared to normal. Residential and commercial sales were both up 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Industrial sales were down about 1%, due primarily to a large low-margin chemical manufacturing customer returning to normal production levels after having a ban on 2017. Absent this one customer, the balance of industrial sales were up over 1%. Moving onto year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date, pro forma EPS were $2.55 compared to $2 last year. Some of the drivers include $0.36 from higher sales due primarily to the favorable weather, $0.19 for Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate, $0.08 related to the impact from tax reform, $0.05 of higher O&M, which include -- which includes voluntary severance expense already mentioned as well as plant inventory write-offs from earlier in the year, and $0.03 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas. Year-to-date, GAAP results were $2.61 a share and include merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results and reflect lower average shares outstanding. Also, GAAP includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger close, whereas pro forma includes them for the full period. In the appendix, we've included a reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma to further explain our results. For the combined company, year-to-date residential commercial sales were up 11% and 4%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The increased sales were driven mostly by favorable weather, which when compared to normal we estimate were a benefit of about $0.29 to year-to-date pro forma results. Industrial sales were down about 1%, again mostly due to a large low-margin customer I referenced earlier. The economy in our service territory is moving along quite nicely. Unemployment rates throughout our service territory decreased to about 3.3%, staying below the national average of 3.7%. We're seeing continued expansion in healthcare and business services, causing office vacancies to continue to fall. Industrials have remained steady and growth is showing up in aircraft and metal fabrication sectors. We've now had 30 consecutive quarters of customer growth and continue to project long-term weather-normalized demand growth of flat to 50 basis points. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll give you an update on our recent financing activities. At merger close, we had $1.25 million of cash on the balance sheet, pushing our equity ratio to 59%. As part of our effort to rebalance the capital structure, we initiated share repurchase programs in August. As we discussed in the past, we're targeting to repurchase roughly 60 million shares by midyear 2020. This will result in a consolidated capital structure, reflecting that of a traditional utility at approximately 50% debt and 50% equity. If you recall on August, I mentioned that we are approaching the buyback at a deliberate and steady pace, focusing on a combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. As you can see on the slide, we did just that, retiring almost 7 million shares in the quarter by only being in the market during the second half of the quarter. We expect upon the completion of ASR this month, the total to be around 9.5 million shares or just shy of 16% of the $60 million share repurchase goal. We expect to keep the same measured approach, dollar cost averaging over time, keeping our foot on the gas and telling how far we've driven each quarter. We used $486 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. As we move down the road, we'll burn through the cash and then issue holding company debt to continue repurchase and maintain a balance capital structure. From a timing perspective, we expect this to begin sometime after the close of the year and project around $1.5 billion of holding company debt to be issued throughout the duration of the repurchase programs. The amount and timing could vary and will ultimately be determined by share price and the cadence of repurchases. This financing plan consists of what we showed the rating agencies earlier this year resulted in debt metrics that put us solidly in the range of our current credit ratings. Turning now to financing activity, we recently executed a new $2.5 billion master credit facility. This aggregate amount is a $0.25 billion more than the stand-alone facilities at which it replace. The larger capacity increases our liquidity and provides more flexibility as we optimize our financing plans. The agreement also includes adjustable supplement features that will allow us to better manage our capital structure at each entity. I will wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. In summary, our growth strategy has 3 major drivers. Our recent successful regulatory outcomes, our execution to achieve promised merger efficiencies and our share repurchases. We made progress on all 3 fronts. Our active 2018 regulatory calendar is in the home stretch, and once we receive our final approval, we should have very little regulatory overhang for the next few years, which provides increased certainty to both customers and shareholders. We've initiated our share repurchases and are executing our merger saving across our businesses. These items plus ongoing organic growth plans support our targeted 6% to 8% EPS growth. As Terry mentioned earlier, we just increased the dividend to an indicated annualized $1.90 a share. We plan to do it along with earnings while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio. Consistent with this cadence, we have previously stated that we'll issue 2019 guidance and the updated projections on our year-end call in February. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

Tony will provide you more details in a bit, but I will say the team continues to perform well and deliver solid financial and operational results, while also executing on our integration plans. We continue to focus on the execution of the merger plan, which includes capturing merger savings, delivering on a busy regulatory calendar and rebalancing our capital structure. Last and certainly, not least, is the continued integration of our workforce and cultures. Our team is working well together as we make progress on the successful execution of our plan. We're still targeting net merger savings of $30 million in 2018 and $110 million in 2019. Our achieved merger savings remain on track for the year. We realized savings in several categories, including reduced labor cost and more efficient procurement as we now have a scale of a larger company. We have begun back office IT system consolidation efforts, which includes a series of enterprise-wise projects, savings associated with combining systems will contribute toward reaching merger savings targets as they wrap up over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 6, I'll give you the latest on our regulatory proceedings. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at an active regulatory calendar that included a merger docket and rate reviews in each of our 4 jurisdictions. While a formidable task our teams' focus nevertheless, was to reach constructive settlements in each docket. The successful settlement in our merger docket jumpstarted many diligent and constructive conversations with stakeholders and the rate reviews. We used the merger settlement momentum to achieve rate review settlements in each jurisdiction, going 4 for 4 across Kansas and Missouri. Although we still need a commission order in one of the dockets, we are happy we've been able to reach settlements with most parties in these cases. This speaks to the constructive regulatory relationships that currently exist in both Kansas and Missouri. So let me give you a little detail on the rate review settlements. I'll start with Westar. In July, we reached agreement with interveners calling for a $66 million revenue decrease with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of approximately 51.5%. It also included $74 million of annual tax reform benefits for customers and $23 million in merger savings benefits. In September, the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the settlement and rates became effective. Staying in Kansas and moving over to KCP&L, in mid-October, we reached a unanimous settlement that calls for an annual revenue decrease of $11 million. It also includes a 9.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 49.1%. Tax reform benefits were reflected in rates at approximately $37 million annually, along with merger benefits of about $7 million. Unanimous nature of the settlement allowed for a truncated evidentiary hearing. We are now waiting on commission approval, which we expect in late December. Once the new KCPL rates become effective, the 5-year base rate stay-out  period will start for both Westar and KCPL customers and fulfills our commitment made as part of the merger settlement agreement. Switching over to Missouri, where our rate reviews for KCPL and GMO are combined into a single docket. Similar to the Kansas cases, we reached agreement with intervenors, allowing us to file the settlement in mid-September. It's a black box settlement, so it doesn't outline an ROE or equity ratio. The KCPL case calls for annual revenue decrease of $21 million, including annual tax reform benefits of $53 million. GMO case calls for a decrease of $24 million and includes annual tax reform benefits of $39 million. Last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission accepted the settlement and rates will be effective no later than December 6. Not only do these settlements create certainty for the next 4 to 5 years, they also modernize rate design and offerings to our customers. We will now have green tariffs of renewable riders in each of our state jurisdictions that will allow us to offer additional renewables to all customers and our largest customers in a fashion they prefer. It's important not only to meet customers needs but also continues our momentum in transforming to a cleaner energy mix. Moving to a few legislative topics. As you know, we work with stakeholders in Missouri Legislature to pass Senate Bill 564 earlier this year. This new law modernizes the regulatory framework in the state, allowing for rate stability provisions for customers and improve return potential for shareholders, a true win-win for all involved. We expect to elect the plan in service accounting, our PISA feature of this bill in the near future, and we're still evaluating mechanics and qualifying criteria for investments. So confident this will allow us to continue spending at appropriate levels in the state, yet reduce much of the regulatory lag that we've experienced historically. What you shouldn't expect, however, is for us to announce a large incremental investment plan or for a significant jurisdictional reallocation of capital, which is currently balanced across our jurisdictions. PISA, coupled with merger savings should allow us to more consistently earn our allowed returns in Missouri. We have an improved opportunity to earn allowed returns as we are rebasing property taxes in the current rate reviews and transmission costs have continued to flat. These 2 factors should also help reduce the lag that we've experienced in previous years. Now turning to Slide 7, I'll touch on the latest in our effort to diversify our generation portfolio. As part of our long-term sustainability strategy, we've been focusing on diversifying our generation portfolio, which results in a lower cost fleet and improved emissions profile. A large part of that strategy is retiring traditional fossil plants as they approach the end of their useful life. We've already shut down a few plants this year, and altogether, by the end of the year, we will shut down 800 megawatts of coal, 700 megawatts of natural gas. At our Westar operating company, on October 1, we shut down Tecumseh Energy Center, a small coal plant; and then on November 1, we retired the gas steam units at the Murray Gill and Gordon Evans energy centers. The merger allows us to shut down these plants that otherwise would have continued to run. So we've built the cost savings associated with those into our target merger savings. For the larger combined generation portfolio, we can now meet our capacity obligation without them and given how attractive wind energy is in our part of the country, we can deliver cheaper, cleaner energy from newer wind farms. Moving to KCP&L, coal units at the Sibley and Montréal plants remain on track to be retired by the end of the year. We'll experience cost savings from these plants as well, but since they were scheduled to shut down absent the merger, the cost savings were not included in our targeted merger savings. Nonetheless, the projected OEM reduction from these will be around $200 million cumulatively over the next 5 years. All of the plants have served our customers well for many years. They were 1950s and 1960s vintage units that lasted well past original expectations. These retirements make perfect business sense. And they also enable a lower carbon future. Since 2010, we have dramatically shifted our generation portfolio from over 50% coal now favoring a much more sustainable mix. This paves the way for a lower carbon future. By 2020, we will have shut down over 2,200 megawatts end-of-life fossil generation, grown our wind portfolio to over 3,800 megawatts and reduced our carbon emissions by more than 40%. You can see a full list of our sustainable initiatives in our recently published environmental, social and governance report, which can be found under the Sustainability section of our investor relations website. This is part of our effort to support the broad industry in providing investor with uniform and consistent ESG data, utilizing the EEI template and guidelines. Before turning the call over to Tony, let me point out some additional good news. Last night, we raised the dividend to an indicated annualized rate of $1.90 per share. This increase comes just 5 months after closing the merger, reflecting our board's confidence in our business plan and their understanding of the importance of dividends and producing an attractive total return. Although dividend is something the Board looks at quarterly, we expect future annual updates to occur each fall. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and impaired results as if",1131,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and impaired results as if Evergy reformed on January 1, 2017. The good news is, as we move further away from the transaction close, we should have less merger-related items and eventually more apples-to-apples comparison for GAAP results. Third quarter pro forma EPS were $1.34 compared to $1.19 for the third quarter last year. Drivers included increased sales, due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.11; $0.09 related to tax reform, which represents the difference in our refund obligation rates and actual results of operations; $0.03 of increased O&M due to about $16 million of voluntary severance expenses, which cost us about $0.04; and $0.02 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas, partially offset by lower number of shares outstanding. GAAP earnings were $1.32 a share or $0.02 lower than pro forma due to merger-related expenses. Combined company retail sales were up about 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable weather, which we estimate helped by $0.06 compared to normal. Residential and commercial sales were both up 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Industrial sales were down about 1%, due primarily to a large low-margin chemical manufacturing customer returning to normal production levels after having a banner 2017. Absent this one customer, the balance of industrial sales were up over 1%. Moving onto year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date, pro forma EPS were $2.55 compared to $2 last year. Some of the drivers include $0.36 from higher sales due primarily to the favorable weather, $0.19 for Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate, $0.08 related to the impact from tax reform, $0.05 of higher O&M, which include -- which includes voluntary severance expense already mentioned as well as plant inventory write-offs from earlier in the year, and $0.03 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas. Year-to-date, GAAP results were $2.61 a share and include merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results and reflect lower average shares outstanding. Also, GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger close, whereas pro forma includes them for the full period. In the appendix, we've included a reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma to further explain our results. For the combined company, year-to-date residential commercial sales were up 11% and 4% respectively, compared to the same period last year. The increased sales were driven mostly by favorable weather, which when compared to normal we estimate were a benefit of about $0.29 to year-to-date pro forma results. Industrial sales were down about 1%, again mostly due to the large low-margin customer I referenced earlier. The economy in our service territory is moving along quite nicely. Unemployment rates throughout our service territory decreased to about 3.3%, staying below the national average of 3.7%. We're seeing continued expansion in healthcare and business services, causing office vacancies to continue to fall. Industrials have remained steady and growth is showing up in aircraft and metal fabrication sectors. We've now had 30 consecutive quarters of customer growth and continue to project long-term weather-normalized demand growth of flat to 50 basis points. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll give you an update on our recent financing activities. At merger close, we had $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet, pushing our equity ratio to 59%. As part of our effort to rebalance the capital structure, we initiated share repurchase programs in August. As we discussed in the past, we're targeting to repurchase roughly 60 million shares by midyear 2020. This will result in a consolidated capital structure, reflecting that of a traditional utility at approximately 50% debt and 50% equity. If you recall on August, I mentioned that we are approaching the buyback at a deliberate and steady pace, focusing on a combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. As you can see on the slide, we did just that, retiring almost 7 million shares in the quarter by only being in the market during the second half of the quarter. We expect upon the completion of ASR this month, the total to be around 9.5 million shares or just shy of 16% of the 60 million share repurchase goal. We expect to keep the same measured approach, dollar cost averaging over time, keeping our foot on the gas and telling how far we've driven each quarter. We used $486 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. As we move down the road, we'll burn through the cash and then issue holding company debt to continue repurchase and maintain a balanced capital structure. From a timing perspective, we expect this to begin sometime after the first of the year and project around $1.5 billion of holding company debt to be issued throughout the duration of the repurchase programs. The amount and timing could vary and will ultimately be determined by share price and the cadence of repurchases. This financing plan consists of what we showed the rating agencies earlier this year resulted in debt metrics that put us solidly in the range of our current credit ratings. Turning to financing activity, we recently executed a new $2.5 billion master credit facility. This aggregate amount is a $0.25 billion more than the stand-alone facilities with which it replaced. The larger capacity increases our liquidity and provides more flexibility as we optimize our financing plans. The agreement also includes adjustable supplement features that will allow us to better manage our capital structure at each entity. I will wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. In summary, our growth strategy has 3 major drivers. Our recent successful regulatory outcomes, our execution to achieve promised merger efficiencies and our share repurchases. We made progress on all 3 fronts. Our active 2018 regulatory calendar is in the home stretch, and once we receive our final approval, we should have very little regulatory overhang for the next few years, which provides increased certainty to both customers and shareholders. We've initiated our share repurchases and are executing our merger saving across our businesses. These items plus ongoing organic growth plans support our targeted 6% to 8% EPS growth. As Terry mentioned earlier, we just increased the dividend to an indicated annualized $1.90 a share. We plan to go it along with earnings while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio. Consistent with this cadence, we have previously stated that we'll issue 2019 guidance and the updated projections on our year-end call in February. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."

Last night, we reported third quarter GAAP EPS of $1.32 and pro forma EPS of $1.34, which excludes nonrecurring merger-related expenses. Tony will provide you more details in a bit, but I will say the team continues to perform well and deliver solid financial and operational results, while also executing on our integration plans. We continue to focus on the execution of the merger plan, which includes capturing merger savings, delivering on a busy regulatory calendar and rebalancing our capital structure. Last and certainly, not least, is the continued integration of our workforce and cultures. Our team is working well together as we make progress on the successful execution of our plan. We're still targeting net merger savings of $30 million in 2018 and $110 million in 2019. Our achieved merger savings remain on track for the year. We realized savings in several categories, including reduced labor cost and more efficient procurement as we now have a scale of a larger company. We have begun back office IT system consolidation efforts, which includes a series of enterprise-wise projects, savings associated with combining systems will contribute toward reaching merger savings targets as they wrap up over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 6, I'll give you the latest on our regulatory proceedings. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at an active regulatory calendar that included a merger docket and rate reviews in each of our 4 jurisdictions. While a formidable task our teams' focus nevertheless, was to reach constructive settlements in each docket. The successful settlement in our merger docket jumpstarted many diligent and constructive conversations with stakeholders and the rate reviews. We used the merger settlement momentum to achieve rate review settlements in each jurisdiction, going 4 for 4 across Kansas and Missouri. Although we still need a commission order in one of the dockets, we are happy we've been able to reach settlements with most parties in these cases. This speaks to the constructive regulatory relationships that currently exist in both Kansas and Missouri. So let me give you a little detail on the rate review settlements. I'll start with Westar. In July, we reached agreement with interveners calling for a $66 million revenue decrease with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of approximately 51.5%. It also included $74 million of annual tax reform benefits for customers and $23 million in merger savings benefits. In September, the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the settlement and rates became effective. Staying in Kansas and moving over to KCP&L, in mid-October, we reached a unanimous settlement that calls for an annual revenue decrease of $11 million. It also includes a 9.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 49.1%. Tax reform benefits were reflected in rates at approximately $37 million annually, along with merger benefits of about $7 million. Unanimous nature of the settlement allowed for a truncated evidentiary hearing. We are now waiting on commission approval, which we expect in late December. Once the new KCPL rates become effective, the 5-year base rate stay-out  period will start for both Westar and KCPL customers and fulfills our commitment made as part of the merger settlement agreement. Switching over to Missouri, where our rate reviews for KCPL and GMO are combined into a single docket. Similar to the Kansas cases, we reached agreement with intervenors, allowing us to file the settlement in mid-September. It's a black box settlement, so it doesn't outline an ROE or equity ratio. The KCPL case calls for annual revenue decrease of $21 million, including annual tax reform benefits of $53 million. GMO case calls for a decrease of $24 million and includes annual tax reform benefits of $39 million. Last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission accepted the settlement and rates will be effective no later than December 6. Not only do these settlements create certainty for the next 4 to 5 years, they also modernize rate design and offerings to our customers. We will now have green tariffs of renewable riders in each of our state jurisdictions that will allow us to offer additional renewables to all customers and our largest customers in a fashion they prefer. It's important not only to meet customers’ needs but also continues our momentum in transforming to a cleaner energy mix. Moving to a few legislative topics. As you know, we work with stakeholders in Missouri Legislature to pass Senate Bill 564 earlier this year. This new law modernizes the regulatory framework in the state, allowing for rate stability provisions for customers and improve return potential for shareholders, a true win-win for all involved. We expect to elect the plan in service accounting, our PISA feature of this bill in the near future, and we're still evaluating mechanics and qualifying criteria for investments. So confident this will allow us to continue spending at appropriate levels in the state, yet reduce much of the regulatory lag that we've experienced historically. What you shouldn't expect, however, is for us to announce a large incremental investment plan or for a significant jurisdictional reallocation of capital, which is currently balanced across our jurisdictions. PISA, coupled with merger savings should allow us to more consistently earn our allowed returns in Missouri. We have an improved opportunity to earn allowed returns as we are rebasing property taxes in the current rate reviews and transmission costs have continued to flat. These 2 factors should also help reduce the lag that we've experienced in previous years. Now turning to Slide 7, I'll touch on the latest in our effort to diversify our generation portfolio. As part of our long-term sustainability strategy, we've been focusing on diversifying our generation portfolio, which results in a lower cost fleet and improved emissions profile. A large part of that strategy is retiring traditional fossil plants as they approach the end of their useful life. We've already shut down a few plants this year, and altogether, by the end of the year, we will shut down 800 megawatts of coal, 700 megawatts of natural gas. At our Westar operating company, on October 1, we shut down Tecumseh Energy Center, a small coal plant; and then on November 1, we retired the gas steam units at the Murray Gill and Gordon Evans energy centers. The merger allows us to shut down these plants that otherwise would have continued to run. So we've built the cost savings associated with those into our target merger savings. For the larger combined generation portfolio, we can now meet our capacity obligation without them and given how attractive wind energy is in our part of the country, we can deliver cheaper, cleaner energy from newer wind farms. Moving to KCP&L, coal units at the Sibley and Montréal plants remain on track to be retired by the end of the year. We'll experience cost savings from these plants as well, but since they were scheduled to shut down absent the merger, the cost savings were not included in our targeted merger savings. Nonetheless, the projected OEM reduction from these will be around $200 million cumulatively over the next 5 years. All of the plants have served our customers well for many years. They were 1950s and 1960s vintage units that lasted well past original expectations. These retirements make perfect business sense. And they also enable a lower carbon future. Since 2010, we have dramatically shifted our generation portfolio from over 50% coal now favoring a much more sustainable mix. This paves the way for a lower carbon future. By 2020, we will have shut down over 2,200 megawatts end-of-life fossil generation, grown our wind portfolio to over 3,800 megawatts and reduced our carbon emissions by more than 40%. You can see a full list of our sustainable initiatives in our recently published environmental, social and governance report, which can be found under the Sustainability section of our investor relations website. This is part of our effort to support the broad industry in providing investor with uniform and consistent ESG data, utilizing the EEI template and guidelines. Before turning the call over to Tony, let me point out some additional good news. Last night, we raised the dividend to an indicated annualized rate of $1.90 per share. This increase comes just 5 months after closing the merger, reflecting our board's confidence in our business plan and their understanding of the importance of dividends and producing an attractive total return. Although dividend is something the Board looks at quarterly, we expect future annual updates to occur each fall. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and impaired results as if",1131,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll start with the results. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus primarily on pro forma results, which exclude nonrecurring merger-related items and impaired results as if Evergy reformed on January 1, 2017. The good news is, as we move further away from the transaction close, we should have less merger-related items and eventually more apples-to-apples comparison for GAAP results. Third quarter pro forma EPS were $1.34 compared to $1.19 for the third quarter last year. Drivers included increased sales, due primarily to warmer weather, which we estimate helped about $0.11; $0.09 related to tax reform, which represents the difference in our refund obligation rates and actual results of operations; $0.03 of increased O&M due to about $16 million of voluntary severance expenses, which cost us about $0.04; and $0.02 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas, partially offset by lower number of shares outstanding. GAAP earnings were $1.32 a share or $0.02 lower than pro forma due to merger-related expenses. Combined company retail sales were up about 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable weather, which we estimate helped by $0.06 compared to normal. Residential and commercial sales were both up 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Industrial sales were down about 1%, due primarily to a large low-margin chemical manufacturing customer returning to normal production levels after having a banner 2017. Absent this one customer, the balance of industrial sales were up over 1%. Moving onto year-to-date results on Slide 10. Year-to-date, pro forma EPS were $2.55 compared to $2 last year. Some of the drivers include $0.36 from higher sales due primarily to the favorable weather, $0.19 for Westar's deferred income tax reevaluation based on the new composite tax rate, $0.08 related to the impact from tax reform, $0.05 of higher O&M, which include -- which includes voluntary severance expense already mentioned as well as plant inventory write-offs from earlier in the year, and $0.03 of other costs, including increased depreciation expense and ongoing annual bill credits in Kansas. Year-to-date, GAAP results were $2.61 a share and include merger-related costs that are in the pro forma results and reflect lower average shares outstanding. Also, GAAP only includes KCPL and GMO results for the period post-merger close, whereas pro forma includes them for the full period. In the appendix, we've included a reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma to further explain our results. For the combined company, year-to-date residential commercial sales were up 11% and 4% respectively, compared to the same period last year. The increased sales were driven mostly by favorable weather, which when compared to normal we estimate were a benefit of about $0.29 to year-to-date pro forma results. Industrial sales were down about 1%, again mostly due to the large low-margin customer I referenced earlier. The economy in our service territory is moving along quite nicely. Unemployment rates throughout our service territory decreased to about 3.3%, staying below the national average of 3.7%. We're seeing continued expansion in healthcare and business services, causing office vacancies to continue to fall. Industrials have remained steady and growth is showing up in aircraft and metal fabrication sectors. We've now had 30 consecutive quarters of customer growth and continue to project long-term weather-normalized demand growth of flat to 50 basis points. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll give you an update on our recent financing activities. At merger close, we had $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet, pushing our equity ratio to 59%. As part of our effort to rebalance the capital structure, we initiated share repurchase programs in August. As we discussed in the past, we're targeting to repurchase roughly 60 million shares by midyear 2020. This will result in a consolidated capital structure, reflecting that of a traditional utility at approximately 50% debt and 50% equity. If you recall on August, I mentioned that we are approaching the buyback at a deliberate and steady pace, focusing on a combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchases. As you can see on the slide, we did just that, retiring almost 7 million shares in the quarter by only being in the market during the second half of the quarter. We expect upon the completion of ASR this month, the total to be around 9.5 million shares or just shy of 16% of the 60 million share repurchase goal. We expect to keep the same measured approach, dollar cost averaging over time, keeping our foot on the gas and telling how far we've driven each quarter. We used $486 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. As we move down the road, we'll burn through the cash and then issue holding company debt to continue repurchase and maintain a balanced capital structure. From a timing perspective, we expect this to begin sometime after the first of the year and project around $1.5 billion of holding company debt to be issued throughout the duration of the repurchase programs. The amount and timing could vary and will ultimately be determined by share price and the cadence of repurchases. This financing plan consists of what we showed the rating agencies earlier this year resulted in debt metrics that put us solidly in the range of our current credit ratings. Turning to financing activity, we recently executed a new $2.5 billion master credit facility. This aggregate amount is a $0.25 billion more than the stand-alone facilities with which it replaced. The larger capacity increases our liquidity and provides more flexibility as we optimize our financing plans. The agreement also includes adjustable supplement features that will allow us to better manage our capital structure at each entity. I will wrap up on Slide 12 before handing it back to Terry. In summary, our growth strategy has 3 major drivers. Our recent successful regulatory outcomes, our execution to achieve promised merger efficiencies and our share repurchases. We made progress on all 3 fronts. Our active 2018 regulatory calendar is in the home stretch, and once we receive our final approval, we should have very little regulatory overhang for the next few years, which provides increased certainty to both customers and shareholders. We've initiated our share repurchases and are executing our merger saving across our businesses. These items plus ongoing organic growth plans support our targeted 6% to 8% EPS growth. As Terry mentioned earlier, we just increased the dividend to an indicated annualized $1.90 a share. We plan to go it along with earnings while targeting a 60% to 70% payout ratio. Consistent with this cadence, we have previously stated that we'll issue 2019 guidance and the updated projections on our year-end call in February.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Terry."
