Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2017. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.21 compared to $1.09 in 2016. This was slightly above our guidance range for 2017. We invested a record $1.7 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2017, part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. This investment included replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline, which drove continued reductions in leaks and methane emissions. We also replaced 68 miles of underground electric cable in about 1,300 electric poles, improving electric service reliability for our customers in Indiana.
We achieved industry top decile performance in our core employee safety metrics, and I'm proud to say that 2017 was our safest year ever. Customer satisfaction scores improved across all NiSource utilities. J.D. Power and Associates recognized Columbia Gas of Virginia as one of the nation's top gas only brands, and NIPSCO, as one of the most improved electric brands, and we added nearly 28,000 new customers with the growth driven by increased conversions to gas from other fuels in a healthy housing market.
We successfully completed key regulatory initiatives with approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia and our power generation environmental investment plan in Indiana. We refinanced nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates, which will result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years. We established aggressive environmental targets supported by our business strategy, including a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. We earned global recognition as the best place to work as well as are our inclusive and diverse culture. NiSource was the top ranked utility in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017, and for the first time was recognized as the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the human rights campaign foundation and in early 2018, we were one of 104 companies in the world named to the inaugural Bloomberg gender equality index. And we delivered the total shareholder return of more than 19% for 2017, significantly exceeding the 2 major utility indices.
As you can see, NiSource's performance in 2017 created value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees and our investors, and we're well positioned for continued growth.
Before turning the call over to Donald, I'd like to note how pleased I am with the targeted solution for the regulated utility industry that Congress included in Federal tax reform. Because this solution supports the continued investment in critical utility infrastructure, that provides long-term benefits for our customers and communities. We're working with our key stakeholders and regulators in all 7 states to shape the most balanced and constructive approach to pass the benefits of tax reform back to our customers. This effort should play out over the next 6 months or so.
To highlight a few examples of this effort, in Indiana, we amended the NIPSCO gas rate case to reflect the impact of tax reform, lowering the requested increase by approximately $26 million. In Ohio, we expect to include customer benefits from tax reform as part of our discussions around the capital expenditure program filing that requests the writer to recover differed capital investments made since 2011, in which are not being recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker.
As I said, these efforts as well as others across the remaining jurisdictions, will take shape over the next 6 months or so. With this clarity about the new tax law and the expected regulatory implementation of its provisions, we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to the financial community and continue to create solid shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,551048891,1395653,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone.

I'd like to start by adding a few more details around tax reform, which we know has been a great interest to investors over the past year.
Turning to Slide 4. With the adoption of the tax cuts and jobs act, we revalued our net operating loss carryforward to $508 million, which is expected to continue to provide NiSource the cash tax benefit beyond 2025. I would also point out that the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities increased our regulatory liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion, which will provide a benefit to our customers. As Joe mentioned, the new tax law is a positive for our customer since it lowers their costs and supports our continued investment in critical utility infrastructure, which benefits all stakeholders by enhancing safety, service reliability and the environmental performance of our system.
As we get to more clarity on the regulatory implementation and work through business initiatives focused on efficiencies, we will better understand the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics. Specifically, funds from operations to debt. With this clarity, we will then finalize any necessary changes to our financing plan, which may include utilizing a mix of hybrids convertibles, debt and equity. I would add that any necessary changes will be within the context of delivering on our stated financial commitment, including every effort to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings. It puts confidence in our plans and the levers and flexibility that we have available to us to manage this near-term impact, and that we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32. We also continue to expect to grow our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% each year through 2020, and to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 million annually in our utility infrastructure programs through 2020.
Moving on to our results on Slide 5. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017 compared with about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would note that our GAAP results were impacted by certain violent sheet adjustments and other items related to federal tax reform.
Let's now turn to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $587 million for the year compared with operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016. Net revenues were up about $164 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by operating expenses, which increased by about $174 million.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $377 million for the year, an increase of about $75 million from 2016. Net revenues were up about $122 million, driven by new rates from the 2016 base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by an approximately $48 million increase in operating expenses.
As we have discussed previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses were largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlement to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we're on track for flat O&M expenses compared with 2017. Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance are available IN our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.
And at the end of 2017, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility in our accounts receivable securitizations. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 7.

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 7. Our gas base rate case in Indiana remains pending before the Indiana utility regulatory commission. In January, we made a supplemental filing, which incorporates the customer benefits of federal tax reform, lowering our annual revenue increase request by nearly $26 million, if approved as filed. The case supports continued investments and system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. An order is expected in the second half of this year.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the 5-year extension of Columbia Gas of Ohio's Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines.
Also in Ohio, we filed an application in December for a capital expenditure program tracker, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 and not currently recovered in rates. Our application seeks to increase annual revenue by $29 million in 2018. And new rates under infrastructure modernization tracker program updates took effect last month in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Investments under these programs are designed to further improve system reliability and safety, while efficiently recovering associated costs.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 8. The IURC in December approved our environmental settlement agreement covering approval and cost recovery for investments related to handling coal ash residuals from certain units at our Michigan City and Schaefer generating stations. Construction work on these projects is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve that system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. New rates took effect in November under our second semiannual tracker update. The latest tracker update request was filed last month and covers approximately $75 million of investments made from May through November of 2017.
In construction of our 2 major electric transmission projects is expected to be completed in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers, communities and shareholders, and are sustainable for the long term. For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share, and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
Thank you all for participating today, and for your ongoing interest in, and support of, NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Andrew?"

As noted earlier, as I mentioned, and Donald touched on this as well, we're very pleased that the new framework reflects the targeted solution that so many of us advocated for across the industry throughout 2017. Fundamentally, because it benefits our customers and supports economic growth, which underpins our business, and it enhances the sustainability of our infrastructure modernization strategy by reducing one of the pass-through costs and customer bills. So while there is near-term adjustments to cash flow that we'll need to navigate, we're confident in our ability to do that, as evidenced by our reaffirmation of 2018 guidance back in December. Donald can provide some additional insights and details, but one of the things that we've looked at is the key to the retention of interest expense deductibility, and we're able to retain that through one of the elements of legal entity restructuring at the subsidiary level that we initiated in early 2017. Among other changes, this effort includes the conversion of NIPSCO to an LOC, which was completed just last week. So note that this minor restructuring has no effect on either investors or customers, but helps us to retain the overall framework, that's so important to us.

And so if we shorten that the 3s and 5s and 10s, that would provide same savings in FFO. We'd also look at hybrids and preferreds that provide you some equity content as one well as equity. So I think it's probably 3 to 6 months -- I'm sorry, 4 to 6 months in terms of a regulatory, that's the part that we're really focusing on at this point, and then the financing plan will come out of that."

And then I'd add to that on the regulatory side with our -- the puzzle of 7 jurisdictions and molecule rate mechanisms, it's a little hard to predict specific timing across each of those but given our relatively rapid regulatory cadence across our 7 states, we have every expectation that most of those are settled going into 2019, and that we have essentially building the rate, the full effect of the tax reform and reduced interest rates in the customer rates going into 2019.

And thanks for joining us. 
2017 was a year of solid execution across all facets of our business plan with industry-leading employee safety performance, improved customer satisfaction across all NiSource utilities [indiscernible] infrastructure investments, increased customer growth, more recognition as the best place to work and [indiscernible].
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2017. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.21 compared to $1.09 in 2016. This was slightly above our guidance range for 2017. We invested a record $1.7 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2017, part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. This investment included replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline, which drove continued reductions in leaks and methane emissions. We also replaced 68 miles of underground electric cable and about 1,300 electric poles, improving electric service reliability for our customers in Indiana.
We achieved industry top-decile performance in our core employee safety metrics, and I'm proud to say that 2017 was our safest year ever. Customer satisfaction scores improved across all NiSource utilities. J.D. Power and Associates recognized Columbia Gas of Virginia as one of the nation's top gas-only brands and NIPSCO as one of the most improved electric brands, and we added nearly 28,000 new customers with growth driven by increased conversions to gas from other fuels in a healthy housing market. We successfully completed key regulatory initiatives with approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia and our power generation environmental investment plan in Indiana. We refinanced nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates, which will result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years. We established aggressive environmental targets supported by our business strategy, including a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. We earned global recognition as The Best Place to Work as well as for our inclusive and diverse culture. NiSource was the top ranked utility in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017, and for the first time was recognized as The Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and in early 2018, we were one of 104 companies in the world named to the inaugural Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. And we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 19% for 2017, significantly exceeding the 2 major utility indices. As you can see, NiSource's performance in 2017 created value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees and our investors. And we're well positioned for continued growth.
Before turning the call over to Donald, I'd like to note how pleased I am with the targeted solution for the regulated utility industry that Congress included in Federal tax reform. Because this solution supports the continued investment in critical utility infrastructure that provides long-term benefits for our customers and communities. We're working with our key stakeholders and regulators in all 7 states to shape the most balanced and constructive approach to pass the benefits of tax reform back to our customers. This effort should play out over the next 6 months or so.
To highlight a few examples of this effort, in Indiana, we amended the NIPSCO gas rate case to reflect the impact of tax reform, lowering the requested increase by approximately $26 million. In Ohio, we expect to include customer benefits from tax reform as part of our discussions around the capital expenditure program filing that requests the writer to recover deferred capital investments made since 2011, in which are not being recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker. As I said, these efforts as well as others across the remaining jurisdictions, will take shape over the next 6 months or so. With this clarity about the new tax law and the expected regulatory implementation of its provisions, we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to the financial community and continue to create solid shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,551048891,1395901,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone.

I'd like to start by adding a few more details around tax reform, which we know has been a great interest to investors over the past year. Turning to Slide 4. With the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we revalued our net operating loss carryforward to $508 million, which is expected to continue to provide NiSource the cash tax benefit beyond 2025. I would also point out that the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities increased our regulatory liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion, which will provide a benefit to our customers. As Joe mentioned, the new tax law is a positive for our customers since it lowers their costs and supports our continued investment in critical utility infrastructure, which benefits all stakeholders by enhancing safety, service reliability and the environmental performance of our system.
As we get to more clarity on the regulatory implementation and work through business initiatives focused on efficiencies, we will better understand the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics, specifically, funds from operations to debt. With this clarity, we will then finalize any necessary changes to our financing plan, which may include utilizing a mix of hybrids, convertibles, debt and equity. I would add that any necessary changes will be within the context of delivering on our stated financial commitments, including every effort to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings. It puts confidence in our plans and the levers and flexibility that we have available to us to manage this near-term impact, and that we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32. We also continue to expect to grow our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% each year through 2020 and to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs through 2020.
Moving on to our results on Slide 5. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017 compared with about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would note that our GAAP results were impacted by certain balance sheet adjustments and other items related to Federal tax reform.
Let's now turn to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $587 million for the year compared with operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016. Net revenues were up about $164 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by operating expenses, which increased by about $174 million.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $377 million for the year, an increase of about $75 million from 2016. Net revenues were up about $122 million, driven by new rates from the 2016 base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by an approximately $48 million increase in operating expenses.
As we've discussed previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses were largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we're on track for flat O&M expenses compared with 2017. Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. And at the end of 2017, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,551048891,1395901,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7.

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7. Our gas base rate case in Indiana remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. In January, we made a supplemental filing which incorporates the customer benefits of Federal tax reform, lowering our annual revenue increase request by nearly $26 million if approved as filed. The case supports continued investments and system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. An order is expected in the second half of this year.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the 5-year extension of Columbia Gas of Ohio's Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. Also in Ohio, we filed an application in December for a capital expenditure program tracker, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 and not currently recovered in rates. Our application seeks to increase annual revenue by $29 million in 2018. And new rates under infrastructure modernization tracker program updates took effect last month in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Investments under these programs are designed to further improve system reliability and safety while efficiently recovering associated costs.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 8. The IURC, in December, approved our environmental settlement agreement covering approval and costs recovery for investments related to handling coal ash residuals from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. Construction work on these projects is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018.
We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. New rates took effect in November under our second semiannual tracker update. The latest tracker update request was filed last month and covers approximately $75 million of investments made from May through November of 2017. And construction of our 2 major electric transmission projects is expected to be completed in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers, communities and shareholders and are sustainable for the long term. For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Andrew?"

As noted earlier, as I mentioned, and Donald touched on this as well, we're very pleased that the new framework reflects the targeted solutions that so many of us advocated for across the industry throughout 2017. Fundamentally, because it benefits our customers and supports economic growth, which underpins our business, and it enhances the sustainability of our infrastructure modernization strategy by reducing one of the pass-through costs in customer bills. So while there is near-term adjustments to cash flow that we'll need to navigate, we're confident in our ability to do that as evidenced by our reaffirmation of 2018 guidance back in December. Donald can provide some additional insights and details. But one of the things that we've looked at is the key to the retention of interest expense deductibility, and we're able to retain that through one of the elements of legal entity restructuring at the subsidiary level that we initiated in early 2017. Among other changes, this effort includes the conversion of NIPSCO to an LLC, which was completed just last week. So note that this minor restructuring has no effect on either investors or customers, but helps us to retain the overall framework that's so important to us. Donald, any other additional details on our positioning on that?"

And so if we shorten that in the 3s and 5s and 10s, that would provide some savings in FFO. We'd also look at hybrids and preferreds that provide you some equity content as well as equity.

Just to add a little context around that whole picture is, keep in mind that the targeted solution reflects the advocacy work that we were all involved in a year ago. So we had a pretty long runway to take into account all of the various factors that ultimately did show up in the tax reform package. So our plans have been well developed over a year or more now. And then I'd add to that on the regulatory side with our -- the puzzle of 7 jurisdictions and [ mono pull ] rate mechanisms, it's a little hard to predict specific timing across each of those. But given our relatively rapid regulatory cadence across our 7 states, we have every expectation that most of those are settled going into 2019, and that we have essentially build in the rates, the full effect of the tax reform and reduce the interest rates and the customer rates going into 2019. So those 2 kind of bookends to the strategy might help think about how we're framing everything."

And thanks for joining us. 
2017 was a year of solid execution across all facets of our business plan with industry-leading employee safety performance, improved customer satisfaction across all NiSource utilities [Audio Gap}  infrastructure investments, increased customer growth, more recognition as the best place to work and [Audio Gap].
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2017. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.21 compared to $1.09 in 2016. This was slightly above our guidance range for 2017. We invested a record $1.7 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2017, part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. This investment included replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline, which drove continued reductions in leaks and methane emissions. We also replaced 68 miles of underground electric cable and about 1,300 electric poles, improving electric service reliability for our customers in Indiana.
We achieved industry top-decile performance in our core employee safety metrics, and I'm proud to say that 2017 was our safest year ever. Customer satisfaction scores improved across all NiSource utilities. J.D. Power and Associates recognized Columbia Gas of Virginia as one of the nation's top gas-only brands and NIPSCO as one of the most improved electric brands, and we added nearly 28,000 new customers with growth driven by increased conversions to gas from other fuels in a healthy housing market. We successfully completed key regulatory initiatives with approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia and our power generation environmental investment plan in Indiana. We refinanced nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates, which will result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years. We established aggressive environmental targets supported by our business strategy, including a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. We earned global recognition as The Best Place to Work as well as for our inclusive and diverse culture. NiSource was the top ranked utility in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017, and for the first time was recognized as The Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and in early 2018, we were one of 104 companies in the world named to the inaugural Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. And we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 19% for 2017, significantly exceeding the 2 major utility indices. As you can see, NiSource's performance in 2017 created value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees and our investors. And we're well positioned for continued growth.
Before turning the call over to Donald, I'd like to note how pleased I am with the targeted solution for the regulated utility industry that Congress included in Federal tax reform. Because this solution supports the continued investment in critical utility infrastructure that provides long-term benefits for our customers and communities. We're working with our key stakeholders and regulators in all 7 states to shape the most balanced and constructive approach to pass the benefits of tax reform back to our customers. This effort should play out over the next 6 months or so.
To highlight a few examples of this effort, in Indiana, we amended the NIPSCO gas rate case to reflect the impact of tax reform, lowering the requested increase by approximately $26 million. In Ohio, we expect to include customer benefits from tax reform as part of our discussions around the capital expenditure program filing that requests the writer to recover deferred capital investments made since 2011, in which are not being recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker. As I said, these efforts as well as others across the remaining jurisdictions, will take shape over the next 6 months or so. With this clarity about the new tax law and the expected regulatory implementation of its provisions, we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to the financial community and continue to create solid shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"
292092,551048891,1396051,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone.

I'd like to start by adding a few more details around tax reform, which we know has been a great interest to investors over the past year. Turning to Slide 4. With the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we revalued our net operating loss carryforward to $508 million, which is expected to continue to provide NiSource the cash tax benefit beyond 2025. I would also point out that the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities increased our regulatory liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion, which will provide a benefit to our customers. As Joe mentioned, the new tax law is a positive for our customers since it lowers their costs and supports our continued investment in critical utility infrastructure, which benefits all stakeholders by enhancing safety, service reliability and the environmental performance of our system.
As we get to more clarity on the regulatory implementation and work through business initiatives focused on efficiencies, we will better understand the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics, specifically, funds from operations to debt. With this clarity, we will then finalize any necessary changes to our financing plan, which may include utilizing a mix of hybrids, convertibles, debt and equity. I would add that any necessary changes will be within the context of delivering on our stated financial commitments, including every effort to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings. It puts confidence in our plans and the levers and flexibility that we have available to us to manage this near-term impact, and that we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32. We also continue to expect to grow our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% each year through 2020 and to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs through 2020.
Moving on to our results on Slide 5. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017 compared with about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would note that our GAAP results were impacted by certain balance sheet adjustments and other items related to Federal tax reform.
Let's now turn to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $587 million for the year compared with operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016. Net revenues were up about $164 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by operating expenses, which increased by about $174 million.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $377 million for the year, an increase of about $75 million from 2016. Net revenues were up about $122 million, driven by new rates from the 2016 base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by an approximately $48 million increase in operating expenses.
As we've discussed previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses were largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we're on track for flat O&M expenses compared with 2017. Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. And at the end of 2017, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,551048891,1396051,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7.

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7. Our gas base rate case in Indiana remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. In January, we made a supplemental filing which incorporates the customer benefits of Federal tax reform, lowering our annual revenue increase request by nearly $26 million if approved as filed. The case supports continued investments and system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. An order is expected in the second half of this year.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the 5-year extension of Columbia Gas of Ohio's Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. Also in Ohio, we filed an application in December for a capital expenditure program tracker, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 and not currently recovered in rates. Our application seeks to increase annual revenue by $29 million in 2018. And new rates under infrastructure modernization tracker program updates took effect last month in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Investments under these programs are designed to further improve system reliability and safety while efficiently recovering associated costs.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 8. The IURC, in December, approved our environmental settlement agreement covering approval and costs recovery for investments related to handling coal ash residuals from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. Construction work on these projects is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018.
We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. New rates took effect in November under our second semiannual tracker update. The latest tracker update request was filed last month and covers approximately $75 million of investments made from May through November of 2017. And construction of our 2 major electric transmission projects is expected to be completed in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers, communities and shareholders and are sustainable for the long term. For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Andrew?"

As noted earlier, as I mentioned, and Donald touched on this as well, we're very pleased that the new framework reflects the targeted solutions that so many of us advocated for across the industry throughout 2017. Fundamentally, because it benefits our customers and supports economic growth, which underpins our business, and it enhances the sustainability of our infrastructure modernization strategy by reducing one of the pass-through costs in customer bills. So while there is near-term adjustments to cash flow that we'll need to navigate, we're confident in our ability to do that as evidenced by our reaffirmation of 2018 guidance back in December. Donald can provide some additional insights and details. But one of the things that we've looked at is the key to the retention of interest expense deductibility, and we're able to retain that through one of the elements of legal entity restructuring at the subsidiary level that we initiated in early 2017. Among other changes, this effort includes the conversion of NIPSCO to an LLC, which was completed just last week. So note that this minor restructuring has no effect on either investors or customers, but helps us to retain the overall framework that's so important to us.

Just to add a little context around that whole picture is, keep in mind that the targeted solution reflects the advocacy work that we were all involved in a year ago. So we had a pretty long runway to take into account all of the various factors that ultimately did show up in the tax reform package. So our plans have been well developed over a year or more now. And then I'd add to that on the regulatory side with our -- the puzzle of 7 jurisdictions and multiple rate mechanisms, it's a little hard to predict specific timing across each of those. But given our relatively rapid regulatory cadence across our 7 states, we have every expectation that most of those are settled going into 2019, and that we have essentially build in the rates, the full effect of the tax reform and reduce the interest rates and the customer rates going into 2019. So those 2 kind of bookends to the strategy might help think about how we're framing everything."

[Audio Gap]
Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2017. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.21 compared to $1.09 in 2016. This was slightly above our guidance range for 2017. We invested a record $1.7 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2017, part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. This investment included replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline, which drove continued reductions in leaks and methane emissions. We also replaced 68 miles of underground electric cable and about 1,300 electric poles, improving electric service reliability for our customers in Indiana.
We achieved industry top-decile performance in our core employee safety metrics, and I'm proud to say that 2017 was our safest year ever. Customer satisfaction scores improved across all NiSource utilities. J.D. Power and Associates recognized Columbia Gas of Virginia as one of the nation's top gas-only brands and NIPSCO as one of the most improved electric brands, and we added nearly 28,000 new customers with growth driven by increased conversions to gas from other fuels in a healthy housing market. We successfully completed key regulatory initiatives with approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia and our power generation environmental investment plan in Indiana. We refinanced nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates, which will result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years. We established aggressive environmental targets supported by our business strategy, including a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. We earned global recognition as The Best Place to Work as well as for our inclusive and diverse culture. NiSource was the top-ranked utility in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017, and for the first time was recognized as The Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and in early 2018, we were one of 104 companies in the world named to the inaugural Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. And we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 19% for 2017, significantly exceeding the 2 major utility indices. As you can see, NiSource's performance in 2017 created value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees and our investors. And we're well positioned for continued growth.
Before turning the call over to Donald, I'd like to note how pleased I am with the targeted solution for the regulated utility industry that Congress included in Federal tax reform. Because this solution supports the continued investment in critical utility infrastructure that provides long-term benefits for our customers and communities. We're working with our key stakeholders and regulators in all 7 states to shape the most balanced and constructive approach to pass the benefits of tax reform back to our customers. This effort should play out over the next 6 months or so.
To highlight a few examples of this effort, in Indiana, we amended the NIPSCO gas rate case to reflect the impact of tax reform, lowering the requested increase by approximately $26 million. In Ohio, we expect to include customer benefits from tax reform as part of our discussions around the capital expenditure program filing that requests the writer to recover deferred capital investments made since 2011, in which are not being recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker. As I said, these efforts as well as others across the remaining jurisdictions, will take shape over the next 6 months or so. With this clarity about the new tax law and the expected regulatory implementation of its provisions, we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to the financial community and continue to create solid shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?"

I'd like to start by adding a few more details around tax reform, which we know has been a great interest to investors over the past year. Turning to Slide 4. With the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we revalued our net operating loss carryforward to $508 million, which is expected to continue to provide NiSource the cash tax benefit beyond 2025. I would also point out that the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities increased our regulatory liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion, which will provide a benefit to our customers. As Joe mentioned, the new tax law is a positive for our customers since it lowers their costs and supports our continued investment in critical utility infrastructure, which benefits all stakeholders by enhancing safety, service reliability and the environmental performance of our system.
As we get to more clarity on the regulatory implementation and work through business initiatives focused on efficiencies, we will better understand the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics, specifically, funds from operations to debt. With this clarity, we will then finalize any necessary changes to our financing plan, which may include utilizing a mix of hybrids, convertibles, debt and equity. I would add that any necessary changes will be within the context of delivering on our stated financial commitments, including every effort to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings. It puts confidence in our plans and the levers and flexibility that we have available to us to manage this near-term impact, and that we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32. We also continue to expect to grow our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% each year through 2020 and to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs through 2020.
Moving on to our results on Slide 5. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017 compared with about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would note that our GAAP results were impacted by certain balance sheet adjustments and other items related to Federal tax reform.
Let's now turn to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $587 million for the year compared with operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016. Net revenues were up about $164 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by operating expenses, which increased by about $174 million.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $377 million for the year, an increase of about $75 million from 2016. Net revenues were up about $122 million, driven by new rates from the 2016 base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by an approximately $48 million increase in operating expenses.
As we've discussed previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses were largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely, and we're on track for flat O&M expenses compared with 2017. Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than at separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. And at the end of 2017, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,551048891,1396432,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7.

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7. Our gas base rate case in Indiana remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. In January, we made a supplemental filing which incorporates the customer benefits of Federal tax reform, lowering our annual revenue increase request by nearly $26 million if approved as filed. The case supports continued investments and system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. An order is expected in the second half of this year.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the 5-year extension of Columbia Gas of Ohio's Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. Also in Ohio, we filed an application in December for a capital expenditure program tracker, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 and not currently recovered in rates. Our application seeks to increase annual revenue by $29 million in 2018. And new rates under infrastructure modernization tracker program updates took effect last month in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Investments under these programs are designed to further improve system reliability and safety while efficiently recovering associated costs.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 8. The IURC, in December, approved our environmental settlement agreement covering approval and costs recovery for investments related to handling coal ash residuals from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer Generating Stations. Construction work on these projects is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018.
We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. New rates took effect in November under our second semiannual tracker update. The latest tracker update request was filed last month and covers approximately $75 million of investments made from May through November of 2017. And construction of our 2 major electric transmission projects is expected to be completed in mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers, communities and shareholders and are sustainable for the long term. For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Andrew?"

As noted earlier, as I mentioned, and Donald touched on this as well, we're very pleased that the new framework reflects the targeted solutions that so many of us advocated for across the industry throughout 2017. Fundamentally, because it benefits our customers and supports economic growth, which underpins our business, and it enhances the sustainability of our infrastructure modernization strategy by reducing one of the pass-through costs in customer bills. So while there is near-term adjustments to cash flow that we'll need to navigate, we're confident in our ability to do that as evidenced by our reaffirmation of 2018 guidance back in December. Donald can provide some additional insights and details. But one of the things that we've looked at is the key to the retention of interest expense deductibility, and we're able to retain that through one of the elements of legal entity restructuring at the subsidiary level that we initiated in early 2017. Among other changes, this effort includes the conversion of NIPSCO to an LLC, which was completed just last week. So note that this minor restructuring has no effect on either investors or customers, but helps us to retain the overall framework that's so important to us.

Just to add a little context around that whole picture is, keep in mind that the targeted solution reflects the advocacy work that we were all involved in a year ago. So we had a pretty long runway to take into account all of the various factors that ultimately did show up in the tax reform package. So our plans have been well developed over a year or more now. And then I'd add to that on the regulatory side with our -- the puzzle of 7 jurisdictions and multiple rate mechanisms, it's a little hard to predict specific timing across each of those. But given our relatively rapid regulatory cadence across our 7 states, we have every expectation that most of those are settled going into 2019, and that we have essentially build in the rates, the full effect of the tax reform and reduce the interest rates and the customer rates going into 2019. So those 2 kind of bookends to the strategy might help think about how we're framing everything."

There is much to cover. So let's jump right in and look at Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest 1.8 -- $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.
Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda, including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland. 
In our electric business, we've initiated the latest integrated resource plan process with stakeholders in Indiana. And we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well underway at our Michigan City and Schaefer generating stations. And our 2 major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year. 
With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We view lower tax rates to help offset other revenue increase request in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts base rate cases, as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's Gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.
With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings to our planning horizon. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

And hello, everyone.Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter, compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2",745,"Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone.
Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter, compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. 
Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results.  Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for 2017.  This decline was offset by decrease in the consolidated income taxes.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment.
Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017. 
As Slide 6 depicts, operating earnings, excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million. 
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investments and lower operating expenses.
We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority, and we've launched an internal effort to make process improvement and find efficiency to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31st was about $9 billion, of which $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity of our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation.  This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.  And on April 18, we added a very cost-effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months, to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.  As you may have seen already, this morning we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million.  This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
Other annually equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plans, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.  We expect to supplement his equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or nonconvertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies. 
As illustrated on Slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low-cost capital going forward.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,558879019,1444962,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 02, 2018",2018-05-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The propos",1180,"Thanks for that update, Donald. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.
We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments and system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year. Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker. 
NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. An IURC order on the new 7-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018.
On February 27th, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflect the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the Commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker. Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the Commission.  We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.
In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our Gas Distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million and new rates took effect on May 1. 
And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rates under the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million.  A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 integrated resource plan process with the stakeholders meeting in March. Through this process, we're working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month.
The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. Investments in NIPSCO's coal combustion residual projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million.  These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and RM Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. In December 2017, the IURC approved the settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request filed on January 30, 2018, and covering approximately $25 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017 remains pending before the IURC.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345 kV, and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability. 
As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015, with subzero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers. I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy.
If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our Second Integrated Annual Report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com.  NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established, customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.
For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share, and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

And so when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at in terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes is in the mix. Certainly, O&M has been a focus of ours here last year. And you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So that is lever that we're managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability, safety and service but at the same time where there's opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings that is also a lever that we will and have in the past. And then obviously around the financing plan, you thought it was good to get out here early on equity. Certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows with significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity. And so we had some costs from -- some of our largest investors to issue equity. So we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the past back of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program, and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year."

As you know, the programs that characterize the bulk of our capital are programmatic, stretch well beyond 2020, great visibility there. The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business. As we go through the integrated resource plan this year, we will refresh that picture, which is more about capacity replacement than the retirement picture that we updated last time. And so as we formulate that strategy, that will give us the same kind of confidence for CapEx beyond 2020 that we have through 2020 today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
NiSource had a strong start to 2018 as our team continues to execute on our well-established plan that's creating value for our customers, communities and investors.
We're getting clarity on the regulatory implementation of federal tax reform. And we're on pace to deliver on the earnings, capital investment and customer commitments we made for 2018. There is much to cover. So let's jump right in and look at Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest 1.8 -- $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.
Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda, including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our Electric business, we've initiated the latest integrated resource plan process with stakeholders in Indiana. And we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well underway at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. And our 2 major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year.
With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We've used lower tax rates to help offset our revenue increase requests in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts base rate cases as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's Gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.
With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings to our planning horizon.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

And hello, everyone.Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 20",746,"Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone.
Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results. Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This decline was offset by decrease in the consolidated income taxes.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment.
Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017.
As Slide 6 depicts, operating earnings, excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million.
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the Electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investments and lower operating expenses.
We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority, and we've launched an internal effort to make process improvements and find efficiencies to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. And on April 18, we added a very cost-effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months, to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you may have seen already, this morning we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
Other annual equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plan, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. We expect to supplement these equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or nonconvertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies.
As illustrated on Slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low-cost capital going forward.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,558879019,1445608,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 02, 2018",2018-05-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald.Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The prop",1180,"Thanks for that update, Donald.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.
We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments and system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year. Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker.
NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. An IURC order on the new 7-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018.
On February 27, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the Commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker. Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the Commission. We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.
In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million, net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million, and new rates took effect on May 1.
And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rates under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process with a stakeholder's meeting in March. Through this process, we're working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP, submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month. The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request, filed on January 30, 2018, and covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017, remains pending before the IURC.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015, with subzero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers. I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy.
If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our Second Integrated Annual Report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com. NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established, customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.
For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

And so when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at in terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes is in the mix. Certainly, O&M has been a focus of ours here this last year. And you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So that is the lever that we are managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability, safety and service, but at the same time, whether there's opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings, that is also a lever that we will and have pulled in the past. And then obviously around the financing plan, we thought it was good to get out here early on equity. And certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows. We had significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity. And so we had some calls from some of our largest investors to issue equity. So we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the past back of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year."

The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business. As we go through the integrated resource plan this year, we'll refresh that picture, which is more about capacity replacement than the retirement picture that we updated last time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
NiSource had a strong start to 2018 as our team continues to execute on our well-established plan that's creating value for our customers, communities and investors.
We're getting clarity on the regulatory implementation of federal tax reform. And we're on pace to deliver on the earnings, capital investment and customer commitments we made for 2018. There is much to cover. So let's jump right in and look at Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest 1.8 -- $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.
Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda, including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our Electric business, we've initiated the latest integrated resource plan process with stakeholders in Indiana. And we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well underway at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. And our 2 major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year.
With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We've used lower tax rates to help offset our revenue increase requests in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts base rate cases as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's Gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.
With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings to our planning horizon.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

And hello, everyone.Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 20",746,"Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone.
Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results. Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This decline was offset by decrease in the consolidated income taxes.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment.
Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017.
As Slide 6 depicts, operating earnings, excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million.
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the Electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investments and lower operating expenses.
We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority, and we've launched an internal effort to make process improvements and find efficiencies to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. And on April 18, we added a very cost-effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months, to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you may have seen already, this morning we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
Other annual equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plan, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. We expect to supplement these equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or nonconvertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies.
As illustrated on Slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low-cost capital going forward.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,558879019,1445893,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 02, 2018",2018-05-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald.Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The prop",1180,"Thanks for that update, Donald.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.
We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments and system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year. Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker.
NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. An IURC order on the new 7-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018.
On February 27, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the Commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker. Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the Commission. We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.
In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million, net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million, and new rates took effect on May 1.
And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rates under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process with a stakeholder's meeting in March. Through this process, we're working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP, submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month. The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request, filed on January 30, 2018, and covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017, remains pending before the IURC.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015, with subzero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers. I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy.
If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our Second Integrated Annual Report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com. NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established, customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.
For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

And so when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at in terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes is in the mix. Certainly, O&M has been a focus of ours here this last year. And you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So that is the lever that we are managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability, safety and service, but at the same time, where there's opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings, that is also a lever that we will and have pulled in the past. And then obviously around the financing plan, we thought it was good to get out here early on equity. And certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows. We had significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity. And so we had some calls from some of our largest investors to issue equity. So we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the pass back of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year."

The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business. As we go through the integrated resource plan this year, we'll refresh that picture, which is more about capacity replacement than the retirement picture that we updated last time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
NiSource had a strong start to 2018 as our team continues to execute on our well-established plan that's creating value for our customers, communities and investors.
We're getting clarity on the regulatory implementation of federal tax reform. And we're on pace to deliver on the earnings, capital investment and customer commitments we made for 2018. There is much to cover. So let's jump right in and look at Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest 1.8 -- $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.
Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda, including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our Electric business, we've initiated the latest integrated resource plan process with stakeholders in Indiana. And we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well underway at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. And our 2 major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year.
With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We've used lower tax rates to help offset our revenue increase requests in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts base rate cases as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's Gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.
With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings to our planning horizon.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

And hello, everyone.Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 20",746,"Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone.
Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results. Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This decline was offset by decrease in the consolidated income taxes.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment.
Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017.
As Slide 6 depicts, operating earnings, excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million.
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the Electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investments and lower operating expenses.
We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority, and we've launched an internal effort to make process improvements and find efficiencies to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. And on April 18, we added a very cost-effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months, to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you may have seen already, this morning we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
Other annual equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plan, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. We expect to supplement these equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or nonconvertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies.
As illustrated on Slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low-cost capital going forward.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,558879019,1447934,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 02, 2018",2018-05-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald.Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The prop",1180,"Thanks for that update, Donald.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.
We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments and system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year. Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker.
NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. An IURC order on the new 7-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018.
On February 27, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the Commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker. Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the Commission. We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.
In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million, net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million, and new rates took effect on May 1.
And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rates under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process with a stakeholder's meeting in March. Through this process, we're working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP, submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month. The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request, filed on January 30, 2018, and covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017, remains pending before the IURC.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015, with subzero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers. I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy.
If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our Second Integrated Annual Report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com. NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established, customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.
For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

And so when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at in terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes is in the mix. Certainly, O&M has been a focus of ours here this last year. And you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So that is the lever that we are managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability, safety and service, but at the same time, where there's opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings, that is also a lever that we will and have pulled in the past. And then obviously around the financing plan, we thought it was good to get out here early on equity. And certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows. We had significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity. And so we had some calls from some of our largest investors to issue equity. So we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the pass back of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year."

The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
NiSource had a strong start to 2018 as our team continues to execute on our well-established plan that's creating value for our customers, communities and investors.
We're getting clarity on the regulatory implementation of federal tax reform. And we're on pace to deliver on the earnings, capital investment and customer commitments we made for 2018. There is much to cover. So let's jump right in and look at Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest 1.8 -- $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.
Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda, including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our Electric business, we've initiated the latest integrated resource plan process with stakeholders in Indiana. And we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well underway at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. And our 2 major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year.
With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We've used lower tax rates to help offset our revenue increase requests in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts base rate cases as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's Gas Infrastructure Replacement Program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.
With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings to our planning horizon.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

And hello, everyone.Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 20",746,"Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone.
Moving on to our results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results. Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This decline was offset by decrease in the consolidated income taxes.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment.
Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017.
As Slide 6 depicts, operating earnings, excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million.
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the Electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investments and lower operating expenses.
We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority, and we've launched an internal effort to make process improvements and find efficiencies to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. And on April 18, we added a very cost-effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months, to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you may have seen already, this morning we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
Other annual equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plan, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. We expect to supplement these equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or nonconvertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies.
As illustrated on Slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low-cost capital going forward.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,558879019,1447953,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 02, 2018",2018-05-02,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks for that update, Donald.Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The prop",1180,"Thanks for that update, Donald.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 11.
We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments and system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year. Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker.
NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. An IURC order on the new 7-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018.
On February 27, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the Commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker. Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the Commission. We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.
In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million, net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million, and new rates took effect on May 1.
And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rates under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process with a stakeholder's meeting in March. Through this process, we're working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP, submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month. The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request, filed on January 30, 2018, and covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017, remains pending before the IURC.
Our 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.
As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015, with subzero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers. I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy.
If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our Second Integrated Annual Report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com. NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established, customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.
For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.

And so when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at in terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes is in the mix. Certainly, O&M has been a focus of ours here this last year. And you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So that is the lever that we are managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability, safety and service, but at the same time, where there's opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings, that is also a lever that we will and have pulled in the past. And then obviously around the financing plan, we thought it was good to get out here early on equity. And certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows. We had significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity. And so we had some calls from some of our largest investors to issue equity. So we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the pass back of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year."

The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business.

NiSource's strong momentum continued through the second quarter. Our team further executed on our long-term growth investments and we took steps in the financing arena that enhanced the sustainability of our plan.
These steps in response to the new federal tax framework improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. They include the $600 million common equity block offering that we discussed on our first quarter call, followed by long-term debt refinancing completed in mid-July, which included issuing $400 million in preferred stock and $350 million in 5-year notes with the proceeds used to acquire $760 million of higher coupon notes outstanding.
We believe these equity and debt issuances, combined with our regulatory strategy, business initiatives and a proactive focus on cost management, have resolved the cash and credit impacts of tax reform, and we remain on pace to deliver on our earnings, capital investment and customer commitment.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.
Our non-GAAP net operating earnings were $0.07 per share in the second quarter versus $0.10 in 2017, which keeps us right on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018.
We also remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
On the regulatory front, we're awaiting a final order on our gas rate case settlement in Indiana. And just yesterday, we filed a settlement in our Maryland rate case. We've also continued to advance settlement discussions in our Massachusetts base rate case. We continue to execute on our gas modernization programs across our footprint and have applications for long-term program extensions pending in Indiana and Maryland. 
In our Electric business, we placed our 2 major transmission projects into service, and environmental upgrades are moving forward at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations.
In addition, we continue to execute on our long-term Electric transmission and distribution system modernization program and have received approval of our latest modernization tracker update.
Our integrated resource plan stakeholder process continues in Indiana, with a robust response to our request for proposals that should provide diverse options to meet our customer's electricity needs for years to come. We continue to target an IRP submission by year's end with the company generation in regulatory strategy coming together by early next year.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

As always, the biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
On Slide 4, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $26 million or $0.07 per share in the second quarter compared with approximately $33 million or $0.10 per share in the same period of 2017.
Through the first half of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $286 million or $0.83 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share.
Due to financial statement impacts and the timing of federal tax reform implementation, our year-over-year consolidated results can be difficult to compare. However, I would like to highlight the approximately $20 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, driven in part by our overall expense management and decreased generation maintenance activities.
I expect this trend to continue through the next 2 quarters, which will exceed our commitment of flat O&M expenses compared with 2017.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments.
Looking at Slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $36 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $54 million in the same period of 2017. Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were up approximately $6.5 million from a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenues.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $77 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $8 million for the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, Electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $5 million compared to 2017.
This increase is primarily due to higher infrastructure investment revenues and reduced O&M expenses, partially offset by slower -- slightly lower industrial usage. 
As I highlighted earlier, we're making continued progress on managing our annual operating and maintenance expenses. And we now expect our annual O&M expenses to be down approximately 4% in 2018 versus 2017.
This progress is beginning to reflect the transformational efforts that strengthens our continue culture and will continue to enhance the value we deliver for our customers and the sustainability of our long-term plan.
Now turning to Slide 8, I like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.3 billion, of which about $7.6 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.7%. I would note the long-term debt balance today is $550 million lower than on June 30, due to the completion of the transaction in mid-July. And this puts our current long-term debt balance at approximately $7 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. 
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing position and actions, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions. And these transactions were completed in mid-July.
As Joe mentioned at the start of the call, these steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improve our credit metrics and strengthen our balance sheet. And it puts us back on track with our previous financing plans to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
This year's financing activity and execution of our plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before we jump into our detailed operational and regulatory updates, I'd like to mention a couple items that speak to our progress in other areas.
As I've mentioned before, our employees are key to meeting the needs of our customers and communities and creating value for all our stakeholders. To attract and retain the best team, we strive to be recognized as the best place to work in all of our communities. That's why I'm so pleased that in May for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the top large employers in the country.
When we provide the right training and development opportunities for our employees, they are more prepared to serve our customers and company well. To that point, I'm happy to say that we opened another state-of-the-art employee training center in Massachusetts this spring, completing the 4 centers we announced in 2016.
The others are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter and early third quarter of 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 11.
The settlement agreement in our gas base rate case remains pending in Indiana, with the decision expected in the third quarter of this year. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. Also in Indiana, a decision on our application to extend our gas modernization program is expected in the fourth quarter. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. The latest tracker update covering approximately $54 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 remains pending before the IURC, with the decision expected in the third quarter.
Progress continues in our base rate case in Pennsylvania. Our request filed in March seeks to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing also reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. In Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider is continuing before the commission. A commission ordered audit is well underway and expected to be completed in about a month. Following completion of the audit, a procedural schedule should be established.
Also in Ohio, in May, new rates went into effect under our current infrastructure modernization tracker, allowing us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. In Massachusetts, we continue to make progress on settlement discussions with the Attorney General in the base rate case we filed in April. The request supports recovery of operating costs related to federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure.
As originally filed, the proposal would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A decision is expected by the end of February.
Also in Massachusetts, new rates took effect May 1 under our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan, starting recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million. And finally, in Maryland, the commission decision on our base rate case is expected by the end of 2018. As I noted earlier, we filed a settlement agreement yesterday covering all but 1 issue in this case. The settlement, if approved, is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million. The Maryland commission is also considering our application for a 5-year extension of our strategic infrastructure development enhancement plan or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
Looking ahead, Columbia Gas of Virginia has decided to file a base rate case and expects to file the request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission by August 28.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, our 2 major Electric transmission projects went into service in June, culminating a 6-year effort and a $600 million investment. The 100-mile, 345-kV rentals Topeka and the 70-mile 765 kV rentals line enhance region-wide system reliability, provide environmental benefits by increasing access to wind and solar energy and improved access to lower-cost electricity for customers.
NIPSCO's 2018 integrated resource planning process continues to advance. The results of our RFP for replacement capacity were reviewed at our recent stakeholder meeting. These results contained a very competitive robust response of 90 proposals totaling more than 20,000 megawatts with several diverse fuel options. The next step is to fully evaluate all of these options to develop the right portfolio of generation to best serve our Indiana Electric customers.
Through this process, we are working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term Electric energy needs. Under the last IRP, submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fire generation capacity by 2023, including Bailey Generating Station units 7 and 8, which were retired on schedule just this May.
The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. I would also note that as the 2018 IRP comes together, we are planning to filed an Electric base rate case before the end of the year. The request will focus primarily on addressing the remaining useful life of our current generation assets, treatment of deferred taxes as a result of tax reform and creating a long-term model for generation capacity to best serve our customers.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities. 
In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our 7-year Electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our Electric transmission and distribution systems designed to further improve system safety and reliability.
The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of Electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. 
In May, the IURC approved our tracker update request covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017. Just yesterday, we filed our latest request, which includes an approximately $14 million base rate refund to customers for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives and managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provide savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
As you heard today, we have a number of significant initiatives in play, including our Electric generation strategy in Indiana plus rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in several jurisdictions.
With most of those expected to be wrapped up or significantly advanced by the end of the year, we will be in a position to provide you an updated look at our long-term business plan in early 2019. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Victor?"

And on the income tax benefits side, you're only seeing -- give or take about half of that flow through. So it is putting a little bit of pressure on the quarterly number."

NiSource's strong momentum continued through the second quarter. Our team further executed on our long-term growth investments, and we took steps in the financing arena that enhanced the sustainability of our plan. These steps, in response to the new federal tax framework, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. They include the $600 million common equity block offering that we discussed on our first quarter call, followed by long-term debt refinancing completed in mid-July, which included issuing $400 million in preferred stock and $350 million in 5-year notes, with the proceeds used to acquire $760 million of higher coupon notes outstanding.
We believe these equity and debt issuances, combined with our regulatory strategy, business initiatives and a proactive focus on cost management, have resolved the cash and credit impacts of tax reform, and we remain on pace to deliver on our earnings, capital investment and customer commitment.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings were $0.07 per share in the second quarter versus $0.10 in 2017, which keeps us right on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
On the regulatory front, we're awaiting a final order on our gas rate case settlement in Indiana. And just yesterday, we filed a settlement in our Maryland rate case. We've also continued to advance settlement discussions in our Massachusetts base rate case. We continue to execute on our gas modernization programs across our footprint and have applications for long-term program extensions pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our electric business, we placed our 2 major transmission projects into service, and environmental upgrades are moving forward at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. In addition, we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program and have received approval of our latest modernization tracker update.
Our integrated resource plan stakeholder process continues in Indiana, with a robust response to our request for proposals that should provide diverse options to meet our customers' electricity needs for years to come. We continue to target an IRP submission by year's end, with the complete generation and regulatory strategy coming together by early next year.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

As always, the biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
On Slide 4, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $26 million or $0.07 per share in the second quarter compared with approximately $33 million or $0.10 per share in the same period of 2017. Through the first half of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $286 million or $0.83 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share.
Due to financial statement impacts and the timing of federal tax reform implementation, our year-over-year consolidated results can be difficult to compare. However, I would like to highlight the approximately $20 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, driven in part by our overall expense management and decreased generation maintenance activities. I expect this trend to continue through the next 2 quarters, which will exceed our commitment of flat O&M expenses compared with 2017.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments.
Looking at Slide 6. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $36 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $54 million in the same period of 2017. Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were up approximately $6.5 million from a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenues.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $77 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $8 million for the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $5 million compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher infrastructure investment revenues and reduced O&M expenses, partially offset by slower -- slightly lower industrial usage.
As I highlighted earlier, we are making continued progress on managing our annual operating and maintenance expenses, and we now expect our annual O&M expenses to be down approximately 4% in 2018 versus 2017. This progress is beginning to reflect the transformational efforts that strengthen our continuous improvement culture and will continue to enhance the value we deliver for our customers and the sustainability of our long-term plan.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.3 billion, of which about $7.6 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.7%. I would note the long-term debt balance today is $550 million lower than on June 30 due to the completion of the make-whole transaction in mid-July. And this puts our current long-term debt balance at approximately $7 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing position and actions, which is covered on slides 9 and 10.
As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions, and these transactions were completed in mid-July.
As Joe mentioned at the start of the call, these steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improve our credit metrics and strengthen our balance sheet, and it puts us back on track with our previous financing plans to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before we jump into our detailed operational and regulatory updates, I'd like to mention a couple items that speak to our progress in other areas.
As I've mentioned before, our employees are key to meeting the needs of our customers and communities and creating value for all our stakeholders. To attract and retain the best team, we strive to be recognized as the best place to work in all of our communities. That's why I'm so pleased that in May, for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the top large employers in the country.
When we provide the right training and development opportunities for our employees, they are more prepared to serve our customers and company well. To that point, I'm happy to say that we opened another state-of-the-art employee training center in Massachusetts this spring, completing the 4 centers we announced in 2016. The others are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter and early third quarter of 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 11. The settlement agreement in our gas base rate case remains pending in Indiana, with the decision expected in the third quarter of this year. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million.
Also in Indiana, a decision on our application to extend our gas modernization program is expected in the fourth quarter. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. The latest tracker update covering approximately $54 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 remains pending before the IURC, with the decision expected in the third quarter.
Progress continues in our base rate case in Pennsylvania. Our request filed in March seeks to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing also reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider is continuing before the commission. A commission-ordered audit is well underway and expected to be completed in about a month. Following completion of the audit, a procedural schedule should be established.
Also in Ohio, in May, new rates went into effect under our current infrastructure modernization tracker, allowing us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. In Massachusetts, we continue to make progress on settlement discussions with the attorney general in the base rate case we filed in April. The request supports recovery of operating costs related to federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. As originally filed, the proposal would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A decision is expected by the end of February. Also in Massachusetts, new rates took effect May 1 under our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan, starting recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million.
And finally, in Maryland, the commission decision on our base rate case is expected by the end of 2018. As I noted earlier, we filed a settlement agreement yesterday covering all but one issue in this case. The settlement, if approved, is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million.
The Maryland commission is also considering our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement plan, or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
Looking ahead, Columbia Gas of Virginia has decided to file a base rate case and expects to file the request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission by August 28.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, our 2 major electric transmission projects went into service in June, culminating a 6-year effort and a $600 million investment. The 100-mile, 345-kV rentals Reynolds-Topeka and the 70-mile 765-kV Greentown-Reynolds line enhance region-wide system reliability, provide environmental benefits by increasing access to wind and solar energy and improved access to lower-cost electricity for customers.
NIPSCO's 2018 integrated resource planning process continues to advance. The results of our RFP for replacement capacity were reviewed at our recent stakeholder meeting. These results contained a very competitive robust response of 90 proposals totaling more than 20,000 megawatts, with several diverse fuel options. The next step is to fully evaluate all of these options to develop the right portfolio of generation to best serve our Indiana electric customers.
Through this process, we are working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation capacity by 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which were retired on schedule just this May.
The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. I would also note that as the 2018 IRP comes together, we are planning to file an electric base rate case before the end of the year. The request will focus primarily on addressing the remaining useful life of our current generation assets, treatment of deferred taxes as a result of tax reform and creating a long-term model for generation capacity to best serve our customers.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities.
In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
In May, the IURC approved our tracker update request covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017. Just yesterday, we filed our latest request, which includes an approximately $14 million base rate refund to customers for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives and managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provide savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
As you've heard today, we have a number of significant initiatives in play, including our electric generation strategy in Indiana plus rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in several jurisdictions. With most of those expected to be wrapped up or significantly advanced by the end of the year, we will be in a position to provide you an updated look at our long-term business plan in early 2019.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Victor?"

NiSource's strong momentum continued through the second quarter. Our team further executed on our long-term growth investments, and we took steps in the financing arena that enhanced the sustainability of our plan. These steps, in response to the new federal tax framework, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. They include the $600 million common equity block offering that we discussed on our first quarter call, followed by long-term debt refinancing completed in mid-July, which included issuing $400 million in preferred stock and $350 million in 5-year notes, with the proceeds used to acquire $760 million of higher coupon notes outstanding.
We believe these equity and debt issuances, combined with our regulatory strategy, business initiatives and a proactive focus on cost management, have resolved the cash and credit impacts of tax reform, and we remain on pace to deliver on our earnings, capital investment and customer commitment.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings were $0.07 per share in the second quarter versus $0.10 in 2017, which keeps us right on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
On the regulatory front, we're awaiting a final order on our gas rate case settlement in Indiana. And just yesterday, we filed a settlement in our Maryland rate case. We've also continued to advance settlement discussions in our Massachusetts base rate case. We continue to execute on our gas modernization programs across our footprint and have applications for long-term program extensions pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our electric business, we placed our 2 major transmission projects into service, and environmental upgrades are moving forward at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. In addition, we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program and have received approval of our latest modernization tracker update.
Our integrated resource plan stakeholder process continues in Indiana, with a robust response to our request for proposals that should provide diverse options to meet our customers' electricity needs for years to come. We continue to target an IRP submission by year's end, with the complete generation and regulatory strategy coming together by early next year.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

As always, the biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
On Slide 4, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $26 million or $0.07 per share in the second quarter compared with approximately $33 million or $0.10 per share in the same period of 2017. Through the first half of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $286 million or $0.83 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share.
Due to financial statement impacts and the timing of federal tax reform implementation, our year-over-year consolidated results can be difficult to compare. However, I would like to highlight the approximately $20 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, driven in part by our overall expense management and decreased generation maintenance activities. I expect this trend to continue through the next 2 quarters, which will exceed our commitment of flat O&M expenses compared with 2017.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments.
Looking at Slide 6. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $36 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $54 million in the same period of 2017. Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were up approximately $6.5 million from a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenues.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $77 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $8 million for the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $5 million compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher infrastructure investment revenues and reduced O&M expenses, partially offset by slower -- slightly lower industrial usage.
As I highlighted earlier, we are making continued progress on managing our annual operating and maintenance expenses, and we now expect our annual O&M expenses to be down approximately 4% in 2018 versus 2017. This progress is beginning to reflect the transformational efforts that strengthen our continuous improvement culture and will continue to enhance the value we deliver for our customers and the sustainability of our long-term plan.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.3 billion, of which about $7.6 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.7%. I would note the long-term debt balance today is $550 million lower than on June 30 due to the completion of the make-whole transaction in mid-July. And this puts our current long-term debt balance at approximately $7 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing position and actions, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions, and these transactions were completed in mid-July.
As Joe mentioned at the start of the call, these steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improve our credit metrics and strengthen our balance sheet, and it puts us back on track with our previous financing plans to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before we jump into our detailed operational and regulatory updates, I'd like to mention a couple items that speak to our progress in other areas.
As I've mentioned before, our employees are key to meeting the needs of our customers and communities and creating value for all our stakeholders. To attract and retain the best team, we strive to be recognized as the best place to work in all of our communities. That's why I'm so pleased that in May, for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the top large employers in the country.
When we provide the right training and development opportunities for our employees, they are more prepared to serve our customers and company well. To that point, I'm happy to say that we opened another state-of-the-art employee training center in Massachusetts this spring, completing the 4 centers we announced in 2016. The others are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter and the early third quarter of 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 11. The settlement agreement in our gas base rate case remains pending in Indiana, with the decision expected in the third quarter of this year. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million.
Also in Indiana, the decision on our application to extend our gas modernization program is expected in the fourth quarter. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. The latest tracker update covering approximately $54 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 remains pending before the IURC, with the decision expected in the third quarter.
Progress continues in our base rate case in Pennsylvania. Our request filed in March seeks to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing also reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider is continuing before the commission. A commission-ordered audit is well underway and expected to be completed in about a month. Following completion of the audit, a procedural schedule should be established.
Also in Ohio, in May, new rates went into effect under our current infrastructure modernization tracker, allowing us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. In Massachusetts, we continue to make progress on settlement discussions with the attorney general in the base rate case we filed in April. The request supports recovery of operating costs related to federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. As originally filed, the proposal would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A decision is expected by the end of February. Also in Massachusetts, new rates took effect May 1 under our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan, starting recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million.
And finally, in Maryland, the commission decision on our base rate case is expected by the end of 2018. As I noted earlier, we filed a settlement agreement yesterday covering all but one issue in this case. The settlement, if approved, is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million.
The Maryland commission is also considering our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement plan, or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
Looking ahead, Columbia Gas of Virginia has decided to file a base rate case and expects to file the request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission by August 28.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, our 2 major electric transmission projects went into service in June, culminating a 6-year effort and a $600 million investment. The 100-mile, 345-kV rentals Reynolds-Topeka and the 70-mile 765-kV Greentown-Reynolds line enhance region-wide system reliability, provide environmental benefits by increasing access to wind and solar energy and improve access to lower-cost electricity for customers.
NIPSCO's 2018 integrated resource planning process continues to advance. The results of our RFP for replacement capacity were reviewed at our recent stakeholder meeting. These results contained a very competitive robust response of 90 proposals totaling more than 20,000 megawatts, with several diverse fuel options. The next step is to fully evaluate all of these options to develop the right portfolio of generation to best serve our Indiana electric customers.
Through this process, we are working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation capacity by 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which were retired on schedule just this May.
The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. I would also note that as the 2018 IRP comes together, we are planning to file an electric base rate case before the end of the year. The request will focus primarily on addressing the remaining useful life of our current generation assets, treatment of deferred taxes as a result of tax reform and creating a long-term model for generation capacity to best serve our customers.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities.
In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
In May, the IURC approved our tracker update request covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017. Just yesterday, we filed our latest request, which includes an approximately $14 million base rate refund to customers for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives and managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provide savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
As you've heard today, we have a number of significant initiatives in play, including our electric generation strategy in Indiana plus rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in several jurisdictions. With most of those expected to be wrapped up or significantly advanced by the end of the year, we will be in a position to provide you an updated look at our long-term business plan in early 2019.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Victor?"

So that happens throughout the year. There is some -- when you look at year-over-year and the impact of tax reform, there is some quarterly impact regarding how we -- our pretax earnings on a quarter-to-quarter basis are impacted by the lower tax rate this year versus last year. But over the course of the year, it all evens out. Randy, do you want to give a little bit more detail?"

Basically, you book the impact of tax reform on your revenues based on your revenue curve, Durgesh, and you book the benefit of taxes based on your pretax income curve. And at the end of the year, they converge and it will be a net 0 on a regulated basis. But sometimes in the smaller quarters, they can throw off a bit of a variance. So we're seeing a little bit of that timing. In fact, if you add the impact of tax reform that we outlined in our slides, together, it's about $37 million of negative impact on regulated revenues. And on the income tax benefits side, you're only seeing give or take about half of that flow through. So it is putting a little bit of pressure on the quarterly number."

NiSource's strong momentum continued through the second quarter. Our team further executed on our long-term growth investments, and we took steps in the financing arena that enhanced the sustainability of our plan. These steps, in response to the new federal tax framework, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. They include the $600 million common equity block offering that we discussed on our first quarter call, followed by long-term debt refinancing completed in mid-July, which included issuing $400 million in preferred stock and $350 million in 5-year notes, with the proceeds used to acquire $760 million of higher coupon notes outstanding.
We believe these equity and debt issuances, combined with our regulatory strategy, business initiatives and a proactive focus on cost management, have resolved the cash and credit impacts of tax reform, and we remain on pace to deliver on our earnings, capital investment and customer commitment.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings were $0.07 per share in the second quarter versus $0.10 in 2017, which keeps us right on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
On the regulatory front, we're awaiting a final order on our gas rate case settlement in Indiana. And just yesterday, we filed a settlement in our Maryland rate case. We've also continued to advance settlement discussions in our Massachusetts base rate case. We continue to execute on our gas modernization programs across our footprint and have applications for long-term program extensions pending in Indiana and Maryland.
In our electric business, we placed our 2 major transmission projects into service, and environmental upgrades are moving forward at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. In addition, we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program and have received approval of our latest modernization tracker update.
Our integrated resource plan stakeholder process continues in Indiana, with a robust response to our request for proposals that should provide diverse options to meet our customers' electricity needs for years to come. We continue to target an IRP submission by year's end, with the complete generation and regulatory strategy coming together by early next year.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald?"

As always, the biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure",764,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As always, the biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.
On Slide 4, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $26 million or $0.07 per share in the second quarter compared with approximately $33 million or $0.10 per share in the same period of 2017. Through the first half of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $286 million or $0.83 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share.
Due to financial statement impacts and the timing of federal tax reform implementation, our year-over-year consolidated results can be difficult to compare. However, I would like to highlight the approximately $20 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, driven in part by our overall expense management and decreased generation maintenance activities. I expect this trend to continue through the next 2 quarters, which will exceed our commitment of flat O&M expenses compared with 2017.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments.
Looking at Slide 6. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $36 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $54 million in the same period of 2017. Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were up approximately $6.5 million from a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenues.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $77 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $8 million for the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $5 million compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher infrastructure investment revenues and reduced O&M expenses, partially offset by slower -- slightly lower industrial usage.
As I highlighted earlier, we are making continued progress on managing our annual operating and maintenance expenses, and we now expect our annual O&M expenses to be down approximately 4% in 2018 versus 2017. This progress is beginning to reflect the transformational efforts that strengthen our continuous improvement culture and will continue to enhance the value we deliver for our customers and the sustainability of our long-term plan.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.3 billion, of which about $7.6 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.7%. I would note the long-term debt balance today is $550 million lower than on June 30 due to the completion of the make-whole transaction in mid-July. And this puts our current long-term debt balance at approximately $7 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing position and actions, which is covered on Slides 9 and 10.
As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions, and these transactions were completed in mid-July.
As Joe mentioned at the start of the call, these steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improve our credit metrics and strengthen our balance sheet, and it puts us back on track with our previous financing plans to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before we jump into our detailed operational and regulatory updates, I'd like to mention a couple items that speak to our progress in other areas.
As I've mentioned before, our employees are key to meeting the needs of our customers and communities and creating value for all our stakeholders. To attract and retain the best team, we strive to be recognized as the best place to work in all of our communities. That's why I'm so pleased that in May, for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the top large employers in the country.
When we provide the right training and development opportunities for our employees, they are more prepared to serve our customers and company well. To that point, I'm happy to say that we opened another state-of-the-art employee training center in Massachusetts this spring, completing the 4 centers we announced in 2016. The others are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter and the early third quarter of 2018 from our Gas Operations on Slide 11. The settlement agreement in our gas base rate case remains pending in Indiana, with the decision expected in the third quarter of this year. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million.
Also in Indiana, the decision on our application to extend our gas modernization program is expected in the fourth quarter. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved program since 2014. The latest tracker update covering approximately $54 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 remains pending before the IURC, with the decision expected in the third quarter.
Progress continues in our base rate case in Pennsylvania. Our request filed in March seeks to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing also reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider is continuing before the commission. A commission-ordered audit is well underway and expected to be completed in about a month. Following completion of the audit, a procedural schedule should be established.
Also in Ohio, in May, new rates went into effect under our current infrastructure modernization tracker, allowing us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. In Massachusetts, we continue to make progress on settlement discussions with the attorney general in the base rate case we filed in April. The request supports recovery of operating costs related to federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. As originally filed, the proposal would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A decision is expected by the end of February. Also in Massachusetts, new rates took effect May 1 under our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan, starting recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million.
And finally, in Maryland, the commission decision on our base rate case is expected by the end of 2018. As I noted earlier, we filed a settlement agreement yesterday covering all but one issue in this case. The settlement, if approved, is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million.
The Maryland commission is also considering our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement plan, or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
Looking ahead, Columbia Gas of Virginia has decided to file a base rate case and expects to file the request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission by August 28.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, our 2 major electric transmission projects went into service in June, culminating a 6-year effort and a $600 million investment. The 100-mile, 345-kV rentals Reynolds-Topeka and the 70-mile 765-kV Greentown-Reynolds line enhance region-wide system reliability, provide environmental benefits by increasing access to wind and solar energy and improve access to lower-cost electricity for customers.
NIPSCO's 2018 integrated resource planning process continues to advance. The results of our RFP for replacement capacity were reviewed at our recent stakeholder meeting. These results contained a very competitive robust response of 90 proposals totaling more than 20,000 megawatts, with several diverse fuel options. The next step is to fully evaluate all of these options to develop the right portfolio of generation to best serve our Indiana electric customers.
Through this process, we are working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP submitted in November 2016, we outlined a plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation capacity by 2023, including Bailey Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which were retired on schedule just this May.
The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. I would also note that as the 2018 IRP comes together, we are planning to file an electric base rate case before the end of the year. The request will focus primarily on addressing the remaining useful life of our current generation assets, treatment of deferred taxes as a result of tax reform and creating a long-term model for generation capacity to best serve our customers.
Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are well underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities.
In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
In May, the IURC approved our tracker update request covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017. Just yesterday, we filed our latest request, which includes an approximately $14 million base rate refund to customers for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives and managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provide savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.
As you've heard today, we have a number of significant initiatives in play, including our electric generation strategy in Indiana plus rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in several jurisdictions. With most of those expected to be wrapped up or significantly advanced by the end of the year, we will be in a position to provide you an updated look at our long-term business plan in early 2019.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Victor?"

As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the greater Lawrence Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions",630,"Thanks, Randy, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the greater Lawrence Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realized that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in greater Lawrence and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. 
In greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers and restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible. Safety and the care of our customers is very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our 7-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low-pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents, with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management, and enhanced damage prevention protocols. 
In addition, the plan includes responsive measures such as designs that would automatically shutdown an effected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation. 
Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities. And our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy. 
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter. 
Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the greater Lawrence event were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018. 
We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments, and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020. 
As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline, and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities in Lawrence Massachusetts. Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses house ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary, and adjust our approach to meet our customers needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible. 
Meanwhile, our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states. Just yesterday, we achieved 2 milestones in our electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest integrated resource plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the integrated resource plan. 
And we continued to execute on both our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program. 
In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts. 
In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our capital expenditure program case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved. 
Now I's would like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."
292092,586292382,1586721,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with",713,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the greater Lawrence event. And we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters. 
However, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance. As of yet, have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of September 30. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018, and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017. 
Through the first 9 months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share, excluding the impact of CMA event. 
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at Slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter, compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017. 
Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform were about $25 million higher than a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses. 
Our Electric Operations segment covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of $123 million for the quarter, compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, our electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower O&M, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage. 
Now turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of September 30 was about $8.8 billion, of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%. 
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. 
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plans and recent actions, which are covered on Slide 9. As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions. 
And these transactions were completed in mid-July. 
These steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. And has put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in a range of $200 million to $300 million, from an ATM program. And $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. 
Consistent with this plan, we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced, creditable financing for our infrastructure investments. And the ATM program files today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020. 
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018, and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,586292382,1586721,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.

Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10. 
New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. The settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million, once new rates are fully implemented. 
Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. Our application for a new 7-year program was dismissed without prejudice by the IURC due to pending legal matters. And we're reviewing options to refile our application at a later date. 
In Pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on August 31. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines, and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, with new rates effective in December. 
In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on October 25 with parties to our application for an annual capital expenditure program rider. The initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017, that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. The settlement also benefit it's customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform. 
In Virginia, we filed a base rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission on August 28, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. We've requested that new rates go into effect on February 1, 2019. And we expect the commission order in the second half of 2019. 
In Maryland, we're awaiting a commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month. This settlement filed July 31 resolves all but one issue in the case, and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million. If approved as filed, the Maryland Commission has approved our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Plan, or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state. 
In Massachusetts, we've withdrawn our base rate case application so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in greater Lawrence. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide 12. As I noted earlier, NIPSCO submitted it's 2018 integrated resource to the IURC yesterday. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next 5 years, and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined, and options point towards lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. The plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available, while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes. 
Also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. The request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP, as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. An IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019, with rates effective in September 2019. 
Investments in our Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are progressing, and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades that are generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and the recovery of associated costs. 
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. A settlement was filed October 25 and our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. It benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates. 
Before we turn to your questions, I just like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is as focused as ever on safety and delivering for our customers across our system. We're executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives, and we're managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments, and provides savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share, and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018. 
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to provide 2019 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter call and provide an updated look in our long-term business plan in mid-2019. As we work through the weeks ahead, our focus remains on restoring service in greater Lawrence, and thereafter, continue to support the needs of our customers in the area. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Mark?"

Was it the more renewable energy or the cost of renewable energy was lower than you thought going into this? Was it discussions with the commission? Was it just customer feedback? First that, and then I guess related to that is does this -- do you have the ability to downsize your environmental upgrades at Michigan city and Shafer because it would appear that you'd be retiring those units earlier then you had originally planned?"

We did, as you noted, accelerate relative to the last integrated resource plan, accelerate the plan for cold retirements with now all of the Schaefer stations lated for retirement within the next 5 years. And the Michigan city unit within 10 years. And it was driven by -- I would characterize it is all of the factors that you've noted, a rigorous economic analysis looking at long run cost, expected cost of all available sources, including continuing to run the existing assets, providing for environmental retrofits known to comply with current regulations. And then to look at we ran an IRP earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for an all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. And when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we've put out yesterday with the IRP. With that further acceleration of coal retirement. And as we sit here today, an expectation that renewables would be the most viable -- most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. We will continue to evaluate that so I deferred as we stepped through time. We look at what's available in the marketplace now and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the timeline of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. So that's an ongoing evaluation. And so the rate case was also filed yesterday. It's really designed to complement that integrated resource plant to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan. And with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a CPCN for both the CCR and ELG, both the coal ash and the water rule compliance. And we have proceeded with the CCR, but we'll continue that because that compliance date is upon us. On the ELG side, the water rule will continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan consistent with what you indicated in your question. So it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics. And coming up with a solution that best fits our expected needs and our customer's supply needs."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions",631,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realized that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in Greater Lawrence and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve.
In Greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers in restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible. Safety and the care of our customers is the very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our 7-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low-pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents, with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management and enhanced damage prevention protocols.
In addition, the plan includes responsive measures, such as designs that would automatically shut down an affected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.
Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities. And our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter.
Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the Greater Lawrence event, were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020.
As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities in Lawrence Massachusetts. Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses house-ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers' needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states. Just yesterday, we achieved 2 milestones in our Electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest integrated resource plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the integrated resource plan.
And we continued to execute on both our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program.
In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts.
In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our capital expenditure program rider case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint, and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."
292092,586292382,1586992,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with",712,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the Greater Lawrence event. And we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters.
However, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance but as of yet, have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of September 30. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018 and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan.
On Slide 5, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017.
Through the first 9 months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share, excluding the impact of CMA event.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at Slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017.
Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were about $25 million higher than a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of $123 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, Electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower O&M, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage.
Now turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of September 30 was about $8.8 billion, of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plan and recent actions, which are covered on Slide 9. As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions. And these transactions were completed in mid-July. 
These steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, and improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. And it put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
Consistent with this plan, we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced, predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. And the ATM program filed today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations-to-debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,586292382,1586992,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settleme",1027,"Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.
New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. The settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million once new rates are fully implemented.
Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. Our application for a new 7-year program was dismissed without prejudice by the IURC due to pending legal matters. And we're reviewing options to refile our application at a later date.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on August 31. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, with new rates effective in December.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on October 25 with parties to our application for an annual capital expenditure program rider. The initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017 that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. The settlement also benefits customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform.
In Virginia, we filed a base rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission on August 28, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. We've requested that new rates go into effect on February 1, 2019, and we expect the commission order in the second half of 2019.
In Maryland, we're awaiting a commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month. The settlement filed July 31 resolves all but one issue in the case and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million if approved as filed. The Maryland Commission has approved our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Plan or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
In Massachusetts, we have withdrawn our base rate case application, so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in Greater Lawrence.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I noted earlier, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC yesterday. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next 5 years and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined, and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. The plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes.
Also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. The request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. An IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019, with rates effective in September 2019.
Investments in our Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are progressing and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades that are generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. A settlement was filed October 25 in our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. It benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd just like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is as focused as ever on safety and delivering for our customers across our system. We're executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives, and we're managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provides savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to provide 2019 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter call and provide an updated look at our long-term business plan in mid-2019. As we work through the weeks ahead, our focus remains on restoring service in Greater Lawrence and thereafter, continuing to support the needs of our customers in the area.

Or the cost of renewable energy was lower than you thought going into this? Was it discussions with the commission? Was it just customer feedback? First that, and then I guess related to that is does this -- do you have the ability to downsize your environmental upgrades at Michigan City and Schafer because it would appear that you'd be retiring those units earlier than you had originally planned?"

Good morning, Charles. We did, as you noted, accelerate relative to the last integrated resource plan, accelerate the plan for coal retirements with now all of the Schahfer stations selected for retirement within the next 5 years and the Michigan City unit within 10 years. And it was driven by -- I would characterize it as all of the factors that you noted, a rigorous economic analysis looking at the long-run cost, expected cost of all available sources, including continuing to run the existing assets, providing for environmental retrofits known that -- to comply with current regulations. And then to look at -- we ran an RFP earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for -- and all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. And when you ran -- when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we've put out yesterday with the IRP, with that further acceleration of coal retirement and as we sit here today, an expectation that renewables would be the most viable -- most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. We will continue to evaluate that side of it as we step through time. We'll look at what's available in the marketplace now, and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the time line of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. So that's an ongoing evaluation. And so the rate case that was also filed yesterday is really designed to complement that Integrated Resource Plan to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan. And with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a CPCN for both the CCR and the ELG, both the coal ash and the water rule compliance. And we have proceeded with the CCR, but we'll continue that because that compliance date is upon us. On the ELG side, the water rule, we continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan, consistent with what you indicated in your question. So it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics and coming up with a solution that best fits our expected needs and our customers' supply needs."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions",631,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realize that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in Greater Lawrence and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve.
In Greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers in restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible. Safety and the care of our customers is the very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our 7-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low-pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents, with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management and enhanced damage prevention protocols.
In addition, the plan includes responsive measures, such as designs that would automatically shut down an affected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.
Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities. And our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter.
Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the Greater Lawrence event, were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020.
As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities in Lawrence Massachusetts. Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses house-ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers' needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states. Just yesterday, we achieved 2 milestones in our Electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest integrated resource plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the integrated resource plan.
And we continue to execute on both our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program.
In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts.
In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our capital expenditure program rider case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint, and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."
292092,586292382,1594033,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with",711,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the Greater Lawrence event. And we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters.
However, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance but as of yet, have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of September 30. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018 and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan.
On Slide 5, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017.
Through the first 9 months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share, excluding the impact of CMA event.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at Slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017.
Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were about $25 million higher than a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of $123 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, Electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower O&M, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage.
Now turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of September 30 was about $8.8 billion, of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plan and recent actions, which are covered on Slide 9. As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions. And these transactions were completed in mid-July. 
These steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. And it put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
Consistent with this plan, we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced, predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. And the ATM program filed today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations-to-debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,586292382,1594033,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settleme",1027,"Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.
New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. The settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million once new rates are fully implemented.
Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. Our application for a new 7-year program was dismissed without prejudice by the IURC due to pending legal matters. And we're reviewing options to refile our application at a later date.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on August 31. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, with new rates effective in December.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on October 25 with parties to our application for an annual capital expenditure program rider. The initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017 that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. The settlement also benefits customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform.
In Virginia, we filed a base rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission on August 28, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. We've requested that new rates go into effect on February 1, 2019, and we expect the commission order in the second half of 2019.
In Maryland, we're awaiting a commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month. The settlement filed July 31 resolves all but one issue in the case and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million if approved as filed. The Maryland Commission has approved our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Plan or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
In Massachusetts, we have withdrawn our base rate case application, so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in Greater Lawrence.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I noted earlier, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC yesterday. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next 5 years and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined, and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. The plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes.
Also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. The request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. An IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019, with rates effective in September 2019.
Investments in our Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are progressing and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at our generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. A settlement was filed October 25 in our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. It benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd just like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is as focused as ever on safety and delivering for our customers across our system. We're executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives, and we're managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provides savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to provide 2019 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter call and provide an updated look at our long-term business plan in mid-2019. As we work through the weeks ahead, our focus remains on restoring service in Greater Lawrence and thereafter, continuing to support the needs of our customers in the area.

Good morning, Charles. We did, as you noted, accelerate relative to the last integrated resource plan, accelerate the plan for coal retirements with now all of the Schafer stations slated for retirement within the next 5 years and the Michigan City unit within 10 years. And it was driven by -- I would characterize it as all of the factors that you noted, a rigorous economic analysis looking at the long-run cost, expected cost of all available sources, including continuing to run the existing assets, providing for environmental retrofits known that -- to comply with current regulations. And then to look at -- we ran an RFP earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for -- and all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. And when you ran -- when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we've put out yesterday with the IRP, with that further acceleration of coal retirement and as we sit here today, an expectation that renewables would be the most viable -- most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. We will continue to evaluate that side of it as we step through time. We'll look at what's available in the marketplace now, and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the time line of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. So that's an ongoing evaluation. And so the rate case that was also filed yesterday is really designed to complement that Integrated Resource Plan to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan. And with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a CPCN for both the CCR and the ELG, both the coal ash and the water rule compliance. And we have proceeded with the CCR, but we'll continue that because that compliance date is upon us. On the ELG side, the water rule, we continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan, consistent with what you indicated in your question. So it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics and coming up with a solution that best fits our expected needs and our customers' supply needs."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions",631,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
As most of you know, in the period since our last investor call, NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realize that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in Greater Lawrence and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve.
In Greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers in restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible. Safety and the care of our customers is the very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our 7-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low-pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents, with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management and enhanced damage prevention protocols.
In addition, the plan includes responsive measures, such as designs that would automatically shut down an affected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.
Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities. And our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.
Let's now turn to Slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter.
Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the Greater Lawrence event, were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.
We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020.
As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities in Lawrence Massachusetts. Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses house-ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers' needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states. Just yesterday, we achieved 2 milestones in our Electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest integrated resource plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the integrated resource plan.
And we continue to execute on both our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program.
In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts.
In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our capital expenditure program rider case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint, and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail."
292092,586292382,1597043,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with",711,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the Greater Lawrence event. And we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters.
However, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance but as of yet, have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of September 30. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018 and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan.
On Slide 5, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017.
Through the first 9 months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share, excluding the impact of CMA event.
Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at Slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017.
Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, were about $25 million higher than a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses.
Our Electric Operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of $123 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, Electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower O&M, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage.
Now turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of September 30 was about $8.8 billion, of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plan and recent actions, which are covered on Slide 9. As you know, in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions. And these transactions were completed in mid-July. 
These steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. And it put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs.
Consistent with this plan, we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced, predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. And the ATM program filed today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020.
This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations-to-debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."
292092,586292382,1597043,"NiSource Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settleme",1027,"Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 10.
New Gas Distribution rates took effect October 1 in Indiana, following IURC approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. The settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million once new rates are fully implemented.
Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. Our application for a new 7-year program was dismissed without prejudice by the IURC due to pending legal matters. And we're reviewing options to refile our application at a later date.
In Pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on August 31. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, with new rates effective in December.
In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on October 25 with parties to our application for an annual capital expenditure program rider. The initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017 that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. The settlement also benefits customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform.
In Virginia, we filed a base rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission on August 28, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. We've requested that new rates go into effect on February 1, 2019, and we expect the commission order in the second half of 2019.
In Maryland, we're awaiting a commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month. The settlement filed July 31 resolves all but one issue in the case and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million if approved as filed. The Maryland Commission has approved our application for a 5-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Plan or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.
In Massachusetts, we have withdrawn our base rate case application, so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in Greater Lawrence.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 12. As I noted earlier, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC yesterday. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next 5 years and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined, and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. The plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes.
Also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. The request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. An IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019, with rates effective in September 2019.
Investments in our Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are progressing and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at our generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. In December 2017, the IURC approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.
We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. A settlement was filed October 25 in our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. It benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd just like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is as focused as ever on safety and delivering for our customers across our system. We're executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives, and we're managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provides savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.
With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to provide 2019 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter call and provide an updated look at our long-term business plan in mid-2019. As we work through the weeks ahead, our focus remains on restoring service in Greater Lawrence and thereafter, continuing to support the needs of our customers in the area.

At then at the same time, how are the rating agencies viewing and how are you viewing your balance sheet, given the cash flow timing issues, perhaps, related to insurance here?"

Good morning, Charles. We did, as you noted, accelerate relative to the last integrated resource plan, accelerate the plan for coal retirements with now all of the Schahfer stations slated for retirement within the next 5 years and the Michigan City unit within 10 years. And it was driven by -- I would characterize it as all of the factors that you noted, a rigorous economic analysis looking at the long-run cost, expected cost of all available sources, including continuing to run the existing assets, providing for environmental retrofits known that -- to comply with current regulations. And then to look at -- we ran an RFP earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for -- and all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. And when you ran -- when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we've put out yesterday with the IRP, with that further acceleration of coal retirement and as we sit here today, an expectation that renewables would be the most viable -- most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. We will continue to evaluate that side of it as we step through time. We'll look at what's available in the marketplace now, and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the time line of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. So that's an ongoing evaluation. And so the rate case that was also filed yesterday is really designed to complement that Integrated Resource Plan to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan. And with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a CPCN for both the CCR and the ELG, both the coal ash and the water rule compliance. And we have proceeded with the CCR, but we'll continue that because that compliance date is upon us. On the ELG side, the water rule, we continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan, consistent with what you indicated in your question. So it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics and coming up with a solution that best fits our expected needs and our customers' supply needs."
