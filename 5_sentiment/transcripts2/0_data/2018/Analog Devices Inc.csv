251411,551398952,1405453,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarter",1218,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected declines in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in a [ 50% ] increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500. 
So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2x to 3x. I'd like to spend some time today by providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting edge mixed signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers. 
The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest performing electronics such as phased array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed-signal heat tech or microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. 
Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the bomb with customers worldwide were engaged with brownfield upgrade and greenfield installations. 
Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true real-time connectivity will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing as well as the highly synchronized real-time communications capabilities that we are bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5. 
In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying secular trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area. 
So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year ago quarter while wired demand remain weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products co-designed with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success. 
Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improved efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. We see this business becoming increasingly important for us particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years, thanks to our market leadership in high performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which had secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years. 
So these businesses combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2x to 3x SAR. 
In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected, both sequentially and compared to a year ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter. 
So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best of both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization, sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on, is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves. 
So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and our dream teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue. 
So to wrap it up, fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and a nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come. 
And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth."
251411,551398952,1405453,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince.

With the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which exclude",1362,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items. First, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging. 
Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17. 
Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback approximately 1 year. 
Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI, with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year. 
So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million relating to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately [ $60 million ] in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders. 
Which brings me to my last topic, leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least a billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our capital allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value. 
So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. 
Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. 
Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7% at the upper end of guidance. 
Non-op expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately [ $60 million ] in our second quarter and a declined by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range. 
That wraps of the P&. L, I now move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter. 
Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter, but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales. 
During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92. 
So now I move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year-ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comps in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. We are planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial trench of COGS synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a [ sub ] 30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. 
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5%, and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44. 
So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comps driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress in putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich, and we are just getting started. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite microwave technologies with ADI's mixed-signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have. The focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also with a combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces we're playing we're pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think at the large customers, the small customers, with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think again, we're starting to see the benefit now of -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittites combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed signal side and traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small cell systems, where phased array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really being the standard, the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area and particularly in the wireless area and communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share."

Like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI.

So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that. LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits. And also in the first quarter of '18, as Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal. Typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits, and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe by that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area, at least in the model. And everywhere that, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization in the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector as well, we said before that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year.

251411,551398952,1405675,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarter",1209,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500.
So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2x to 3x.
I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting-edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers.
The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest performing electronics such as phased-array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed signal, Hittite's microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. 
Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the bomb with customers worldwide. We're engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations. 
Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true real-time connectivity will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing as well as the highly synchronized real-time communications capabilities that we are bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.
In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying secular trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area.
So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products co-designed with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.
Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improve efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years, thanks to our market leadership in high-performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years.
So these businesses, combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2x to 3x SAAR.
In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected both sequentially and compared to a year ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.
So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best of both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization, sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on, is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.
So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and the dream teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.
So to wrap it up, fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.
And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth."

With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes",1356,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items: first, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.
Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17.
Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback approximately 1 year. 
Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI, with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate, offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year.
So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders.
Which brings me to my last topic, leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our cap allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.
So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter.
Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7%, at the upper end of guidance.
Nonop expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our nonop expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.
That wraps up the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.
Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year ago quarter but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales.
During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92.
So now I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comms, in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of cost synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub-30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again.
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5% and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.
So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich, and we are just getting started.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity",329,"Yes. I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite microwave technologies with ADI's mixed signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have and the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also, with the combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think, at the large customers, the small customers with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think, again, we're starting to see the benefit now of the -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittite combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small-cell systems, where phased-array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really the standard, the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area and particularly in the wireless area and communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share."

There's really no seasonality in that business. But I think what's important there, it grew year-over-year. And it really was led by our wireless growth, which is up double digits year-over-year. And industrial was down about 3% sequentially on an adjusted basis or up mid-teens percent year-over-year. Once again, very good strong growth there. In consumer, it was weak. It was weak.

Like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are in inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2, and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year."

So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that; LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits and also in the first quarter of '18. As Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal, typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area at least into the model. And everywhere that -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector, well, we've said before that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter."

Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. 
Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500. 
So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2 to 3x.
I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting-edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers.
The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest-performing electronics, such as phased-array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed signal, Hittite -- [ or ] Microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. 
Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the BOM with customers worldwide. We're engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations. 
Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true realtime connectivity, will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. 
For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities, such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing, as well as the highly synchronized realtime communications capabilities that we're bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.
In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying sector trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area.
So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year-ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products codesigned with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.
Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improve efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. 
We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years thanks to our market leadership in high-performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years.
So these businesses, combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen-sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2 to 3x SAAR. In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected both sequentially and compared to a year-ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.
So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best-of-both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization -- sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on -- is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.
So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and adjoining teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.
So to wrap it up. Fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices' capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.
And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth."
251411,551398952,1409459,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince.

With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes",1357,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items: first, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Job Acts; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.
Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17.
Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback of approximately 1 year. 
Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate, offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year.
So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. 
We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders.
Which brings me to my last topic: leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our cap allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.
So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. 
Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7%, at the upper end of guidance.
Nonop expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our nonop expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.
That wraps up the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.
Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales.
During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92.
So now I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. 
We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year-ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comms, in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. 
We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of COGS synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub-30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5% and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.
So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich. And we are just getting started.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity",328,"Yes. I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite Microwave technologies with ADI's mixed signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have, the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also, with the combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think, at the large customers, the small customers with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think, again, we're starting to see the benefit now of the -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittite combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small-cell systems, where phased-array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really the standard -- the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area, particularly in the wireless area in communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share."

But I think what's important there, it grew year-over-year. And it really was led by our wireless growth, which is up double digits year-over-year. And industrial was down about 3% sequentially on an adjusted basis or up mid-teens percent year-over-year. Once again, very good strong growth there. In consumer, we saw it as weak. It was weak.

The -- like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are in inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2, and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year."

So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that; LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits and also in the first quarter of '18. As Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal, typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area, at least into the model. And everywhere that -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector, well, we've said before, that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter."

So I would say first and foremost, that's the case. When you look at the backdrop, our market growth is very broad based, and all applications and geographies are up in double digits year-over-year. So again, you look at the PMIs, they're still in expansion phase globally. And GDP is converging across the globe across all the major geographies into an expansionary phase.

We're able to take a complete system, be it nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud, microwave to bits.

Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO Vincent Roche. Vince?"
251411,551398952,1409736,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarte",1206,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. 
Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500. 
So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2 to 3x.
I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting-edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers.
The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest-performing electronics, such as phased-array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed signal, Hittite -- [ or ] Microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. 
Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the BOM with customers worldwide. We're engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations. 
Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true realtime connectivity, will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. 
For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities, such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing, as well as the highly synchronized realtime communications capabilities that we're bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.
In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying sector trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area.
So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year-ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products codesigned with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.
Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improve efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. 
We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years thanks to our market leadership in high-performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years.
So these businesses, combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen-sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2 to 3x SAAR. In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected both sequentially and compared to a year-ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.
So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best-of-both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization -- sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on -- is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.
So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and adjoining teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.
So to wrap it up. Fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices' capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.
And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth."
251411,551398952,1409736,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes",1357,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items: first, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Job Acts; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.
Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17.
Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback of approximately 1 year. 
Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate, offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year.
So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. 
We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders.
Which brings me to my last topic: leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our cap allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.
So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. 
Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7%, at the upper end of guidance.
Nonop expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our nonop expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.
That wraps up the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.
Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales.
During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92.
So now I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. 
We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year-ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comms, in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. 
We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of COGS synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub-30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5% and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.
So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich. And we are just getting started.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite Microwave technologies with ADI's mixed signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have, the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also, with the combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think, at the large customers, the small customers with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think, again, we're starting to see the benefit now of the -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittite combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small-cell systems, where phased-array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really the standard -- the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area, particularly in the wireless area in communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share."

The -- like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are in inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2, and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year."

So I would guide you that OpEx in the second quarter, if we put -- we expect kind of be in that -- in the sub-30% of revenue, which we think is a great target for us as we continue to drive the conversion of the cash, so -- conversion of the profit.

So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that; LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits and also in the first quarter of '18. As Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal, typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area, at least into the model. And everywhere that -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector, well, we've said before, that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter."

So I would say first and foremost, that's the case. When you look at the backdrop, our market growth is very broad based, and all applications and geographies are up in double digits year-over-year. So again, you look at the PMIs, they're still in expansion phase globally. And GDP is converging across the globe across all the major geographies into an expansionary phase. So also, we pay a lot of attention to what our customers are saying. And I would tell you that our customers across the board and all the regions are pragmatically optimistic.

So we are getting more content gain across all our industrial customers, both big and small. And I will tell you as well that in the areas of aerospace and defense and instrumentation, the combination with Hittite has really -- that's catalyzed content gain, and I think we're able to solve our customers' problems at a level that others can't in these areas. We're able to take a complete system, be it nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud, microwave to bits. So I think a large part is the sheer arsenal of technologies and products that we've got and we bring to bear, the focus that we've got as a company and how we're serving our customers' needs, being able to build more complete solutions for them.

Revenue in the first quarte",1206,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. 
Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500. 
So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2 to 3x.
I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting-edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers.
The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest-performing electronics, such as phased-array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed signal, Hittite’s microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. 
Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the BOM with customers worldwide. We're engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations. 
Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true real-time connectivity, will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. 
For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing as well as the highly synchronized real-time communications capabilities that we are bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.
In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying sector trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area.
So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products co-designed with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.
Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improve efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. 
We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years, thanks to our market leadership in high-performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years.
So these businesses, combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2 to 3x SAAR. In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected both sequentially and compared to a year ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.
So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best-of-both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization, sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on -- is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.
So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and adjoining teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.
So to wrap it up, fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices' capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.
And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes",1357,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items: first, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Job Acts; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.
Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17.
Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback of approximately 1 year. 
Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate, offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year.
So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. 
We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders.
Which brings me to my last topic: leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our cap allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.
So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. 
Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7%, at the upper end of guidance.
Nonop expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our nonop expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.
That wraps up the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.
Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year ago quarter but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales.
During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92.
So now I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. 
We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comms, in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. 
We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of COGS synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub-30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5% and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.
So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich, and we are just getting started.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite Microwave technologies with ADI's mixed signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have and the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also, with the combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think, at the large customers, the small customers with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think, again, we're starting to see the benefit now of the -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittite combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small-cell systems, where phased-array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really the standard, the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area and particularly in the wireless area in communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share."

The -- like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are in inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2, and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year."

So it will take most likely 3. But obviously, we're trying to push as hard as we can for the efficiencies to kick in earlier. But that's the rule of thumb, 3 years."

So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that; LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits and also in the first quarter of '18. As Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal, typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area at least into the model. And everywhere that -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector, well, we've said before that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter."

So I would say first and foremost, that's the case. When you look at the backdrop, our market growth is very broad based, and all applications and geographies are up in double digits year-over-year. So again, you look at the PMIs, they're still in expansion phase globally. And GDP is converging across the globe across all the major geographies into an expansionary phase. So also, we pay a lot of attention to what our customers are saying. And I would tell you that our customers across the board and all the regions are pragmatically optimistic.

So we are getting more content gain across all our industrial customers, both big and small. And I will tell you as well that in the areas of aerospace and defense and instrumentation, the combination with Hittite has really -- that's catalyzed content gain, and I think we're able to solve our customers' problems at a level that others can't in these areas. We're able to take a complete system, be it nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud, microwave to bits. So I think a large part is the sheer arsenal of technologies and products that we've got and we bring to bear, the focus that we've got as a company and how we're serving our customers' needs, being able to build more complete solutions for them.

Growth and operating margin expanded substantially compared to a year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cash flow in the quarter, and our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500. 
Now before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions, and the accuracy and integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder. Now I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry, and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high-quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits and nanowatts to kilowatts. It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power and connect these 2 worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction and future important technologies such as virtual and augmented reality and so on. 
Today though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth hungry areas such as high-definition video streaming. Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the addition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The used case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real, and massive MIMO systems can deliver a greater than [ 3 ] [indiscernible] capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G base station. And this helps to solve 2 large challenges for carriers: Capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50% while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use on average 8x the number of radios compared to today's systems. 
Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world. These radios can also scale from small cells to macro base stations to massive MIMO radios, and they offer a flexible architecture capable of rightsizing the analog and digital performance needed by our customers' product family. 
However, to realize in the longer term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity using phased-array solutions. In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges. 
In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete rearchitecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This [indiscernible] network will be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabit per second download speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications such as digital health care, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors and augmented reality systems. This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. 
5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal chain solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to 3x the bond when compared to our 4G solutions. 
Now while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. And here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend as we have seen share gains in traditional 4G macro products, thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integrated software defined transceivers across macro, small cells and massive MIMO trials. 
So in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain know how, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite technology. So looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future. 
Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I'll continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth."

With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special i",995,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings Call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion, above the high end of our guidance and increasing 25% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis. 
Now before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B revenue increased 14% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter. Growth in this market was once again broad-based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation in health care continue to drive outperformance. 
Turning to the comps market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter. Sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position in virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comps revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollout, and 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are positioned to provide enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio. 
Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. After a better than seasonal first quarter, second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year-ago quarter with growth led by the infotainment and powertrain applications. And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the second quarter, and as previously communicated, decrease compared to our year ago quarter. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. 
Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%.  There is no change to our expectation for fiscal 2019, and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.45, increasing over 40% year-over-year. 
Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decreased 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year ago quarter. We generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter with associated free cash flow margins [ of ] 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion. 
During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x, down from the 2.4x in the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our 2x leverage ratio within the next 2 quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million, and we expect CapEx for fiscal '18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. And during the quarter, we paid $178 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
So let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. And we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up $10 million year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. 
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52. 
So to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI, and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year-over-year, and our strong operational execution drove growth and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cash flow in the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really kind of 2 phases to 5G, at least from a ADI perspective. There is the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. And the pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G. So our software defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond these transceiver technologies because they're so flexible are usable well in since beyond communications. Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in kind of pre-5G systems. But it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe. My sense, Tore, is that U.S. and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 time frame. We'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market, I think, with what they call 5G, which is really to me, 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So I hope that explains what it is we're doing. And in the run up to what will be pure 5G in the 2024, 2025 time frame where the core network has changed with virtualization, edge computing and fewer millimeter wave technologies, spanning multiple different frequency levels."

So obviously, we're performing below my expectatio",1047,"Yes, thanks, John. So look, our business right now, our long-term goal is to grow at the high end of kind of 2 to 3 SAAR. And our objective, obviously, is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. So obviously, we're performing below my expectations, and we're not happy as a management team right now as to where we are. But let me try and unpack the story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So we were clear in our last call that the profiles for ADI and LTC are quite different in the automotive sector today. ADI, we -- the ADI legacy business increased at the kind of level of 2 to 3 SAAR in '17. It looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level, whereas the LTC growth level has been in the low single digits or closer to kind of 1 SAAR. So but what I will tell you is that we're making a lot of progress in improving LTC's growth rates, and we've uncovered a lot of revenue synergy opportunities. And we've also changed the business logic within LTC and tilted more towards growth. Profitability has always been important. It will always be important, but we're also tilting more aggressively towards growth. But as you know, in this market, it just takes time to materialize the design wins that we've got in place. And my sense is those design wins won't materially impact the revenue, will not materially impact the revenue for a couple of years. What I'd like to is just turn our attention now to giving you a sense for what momentum we have in our business and what we're doing to get our revenue towards -- to get the growth levels to the higher end of the 2 to 3 SAAR. And as you know, we've talked before, we have 3 primary application areas in our business: Infotainment, autonomous driving and electrification. I'm going to talk to those in a little bit of detail and try and impacted story a bit for you. So in infotainment, we've won a lot of premium audio sockets. That's a great heritage for ADI across all geos, and that's really the foundation of the infotainment business. And the good news there is we're now beginning to attach LTC power to the clusters of ADI, DSP and mixed-signal technologies. We've talked before as well of our A2B technologies, and we're really getting a lot of momentum there. And what I can tell you is that about a dozen OEMs are planning to deploy that technology in the next few years across the globe in many, many geos. Now that is also -- everything I talked about here is an opportunity for LTC power attachment. If I turn to autonomous vehicles, we haven't really talked much before about our LIDAR solution, but we're gaining design ins today in long and short-range LIDAR systems with both the ADI mixed-signal technologies and the LTE portfolios and even getting some sockets for Hittite in the very, very high frequency areas. These components complement the more advanced capability that we're working on now to produce a solid-state beam steering and photodetector technology. And that will dramatically drive the size, the cost, the power, and we believe enable over the longer term, the kind of mid- to long-term 3, 4, 5 years, mass deployment of LIDAR. And we got that new technology in terms of that more integrated system capability through the acquisition of investment sometime last year. Also in autonomous vehicles, we have several design ins in place with our inertial management units, our IMUs, as we call them. And we're engaged in that almost every self driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well. So that technology, which we've been using, we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example. It's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's used as a failsafe function in the event of a radar system failure. And I will turn to electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got for our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business that we might have lost or have lost by changing again our business logic, as I talked a little earlier about, to tilting towards growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the kind of the cost profile of the products. And we're broadening LTC's customer base, bringing that technology into the strong relationships that legacy ADI has in North America and with European OEMs. Also our next-generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well. And one other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have and our isolation we have, a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there is a high-voltage and low-voltage connection. So these technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there. And not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies that we've got on the power side of things. My sense is that in a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business, given the design cycles that we've got in the strength of the power portfolio. So I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve. I believe we're focused on the right apps, the right customers. We have a terrific technology story and with the complementary customer base and Geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. So I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well."

So the way we view it in the short term, there is a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe and particularly around China. So my sense is that there are many other competitors in play who will fill the demand for building out the networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE, so it's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of headwind for the company last quarter. So I think overall, most deals are up in communications for ADI. We're getting share, and my sense is that, we're obviously staying close to the situation as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place. But I will tell you, clearly, U.S. and China need each other. And I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. And we're expecting political leaders to figure this out. So my sense is at the end of the day, there is demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building our networks out to capture the opportunity to build a revenue profit streams. And that demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other."

One is our prosumer, which looks a lot like our B2B markets with lots of customers, products and different applications globally. And that business has been strengthened as well with the addition of the LTC revenue and applications. And that's in the $300 million-plus area, so it's a significant portion of consumer for ADI. We're expecting, looking into our -- somewhere in the back end of third quarter and fourth quarter, we're expecting what is normally a seasonally strong quarter to be so. We stated previously that consumer will be down 20% to 30% for the year, and this is how the year appears to be trending now. So our strategy remains the same, to focus -- to leverage our technologies into areas of very, very high differentiation where we can get a higher return on investment. And we continue to execute against that strategy."

Well, the second quarter of fiscal '18 was remarkable for ADI. We posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and set a new high watermark in free cash flow generation, and I'm pleased to share some perspective on our results with you now. So revenue in the second quarter came in just above the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors, offset the expected decline in consumer. Our results were also supported by our Linear Tech franchise, which posted a record revenue quarter. Growth and operating margin expanded substantially compared to the year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cash flow in the quarter, and our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500. 
Now before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions, and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder. Now I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry, and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high-quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits and nanowatts to kilowatts. It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power and connect these 2 worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction and future important technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality and so on. 
Today, though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth-hungry areas such as high-definition video streaming. Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the addition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The used case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real, and massive MIMO system can deliver a greater than 3x data capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G base station. And this helps to solve 2 large challenges for carriers: capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50% while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use, on average, 8x the number of radios compared to today's systems. 
Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world. These radios can also scale from small cells to macro base stations to massive MIMO radios, and they offer a flexible architecture capable of rightsizing the analog and digital performance needed by a customers' product family. 
However, to realize the longer-term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity using phased-array solutions. In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges. 
In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete re-architecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This backbone network would be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabit per second download speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications such as digital health care, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors and augmented reality systems. This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. 
5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal chain solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to 3x the bond when compared to our 4G solutions. 
Now while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. And here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rates over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend as we have seen share gains in traditional 4G macro products, thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integrated software-defined transceivers across macro, small cells and massive MIMO trials. 
So in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain knowhow, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite and Linear Technology. So looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future. 
Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I'll continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth."

With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special i",995,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion, above the high end of our guidance and increasing 25% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis. 
Now before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B revenue increased 14% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter. Growth in this market was once again broad based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation and health care continue to drive outperformance. 
Turning to the comms market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter. Sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position on virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comms revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollout, and 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are positioned to provide the enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio. 
Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. After a better than seasonal first quarter, second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year-ago quarter, with growth led by the infotainment and powertrain applications. And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the second quarter, and as previously communicated, decreased compared to our year ago quarter. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to the first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. 
Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%.  There is no change to our expectation for fiscal 2019, and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.45, increasing over 40% year-over-year. 
Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decreased 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. We've generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter, with associated free cash flow margins of 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion. 
During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x, down from the 2.4x in the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our 2x leverage ratio within the next 2 quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million, and we expect CapEx for fiscal '18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. And during the quarter, we've paid $178 million in dividends, with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
So let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning for revenue in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. And we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up $10 million year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. 
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52. 
So to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI, and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year-over-year, and our strong operational execution drove growth and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cash flow in the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really kind of 2 phases to 5G, at least from an ADI perspective. There is the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. And the pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G. So our software-defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond these transceiver technologies, because they're so flexible, are usable as well in places beyond communications. Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in kind of pre-5G systems. But it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe. My sense, Tore, is that U.S. and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 time frame. We'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market, I think, with what they call 5G, which is really to me, 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So I hope that explains what it is we're doing. And in the run up to what will be pure 5G in the 2024, 2025 time frame where the core network has changed with virtualization, edge computing and pure millimeter wave technologies, spanning multiple different frequency levels."

So I'm just kind of curious, you've kind of been under growing your peers in auto, which was explainable over multiple years because of the MEMS part of your business. But that should be a fairly small part of the business now. So I'm just kind of curious as to what's holding back growth in that market, and how you kind of feel your long-term position is in the auto space."

And our objective, obviously, is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. So obviously, we're performing below my expectations, and we're not happy as a management team right now as to where we are. But let me try to unpack the story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So we were clear in our last call that the profiles for ADI and LTC are quite different in the automotive sector today. ADI, we -- the ADI legacy business increased at the kind of level of 2 to 3 SAAR in '17. And it looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level. Whereas the LTC growth level has been in the low single digits or closer to kind of 1 SAAR. So -- but what I will tell you is that we're making a lot of progress in improving LTC's growth rates, and we've uncovered a lot of revenue synergy opportunities. And we've also changed the business logic within LTC and tilted more towards growth. Profitability has always been important, will always be important, but we're also tilting more aggressively towards growth. But as you know, in this market, it just takes time to materialize the design wins that we've got in place. And my sense is those design wins won't materially impact the revenue, will not materially impact the revenue for a couple of years. What I'd like to do is just turn our attention now to giving you a sense for what momentum we have in our business and what we're doing to get our revenue towards -- to get the growth levels to the higher end of the 2 to 3 SAAR. And as you know, we've talked before, we have 3 primary application areas in our business: infotainment, autonomous driving and electrification. I'm going to talk to those in a little bit of detail and try to unpack the story a bit for you. So in infotainment, we've won a lot of premium audio sockets. That's a great heritage for ADI across all geos, and that's really the foundation of the infotainment business. And the good news there is we're now beginning to attach LTC power to the clusters of ADI, DSP and mixed-signal technologies. We've talked before as well of our A2B technologies, and we're really getting a lot of momentum there. And what I can tell you is that about a dozen OEMs are planning to deploy that technology in the next few years across the globe in many, many geos. Now that is also -- everything I talked about here is an opportunity for LTC power attachment. If I turn to autonomous vehicles. We haven't really talked much before about our LIDAR solution, but we're gaining design ins today in long and short-range LIDAR systems, with both the ADI mixed-signal technologies and the LT portfolios and even getting some sockets for Hittite in the very, very high-frequency areas. These components complement the more advanced capability that we're working on now to produce a solid-state beam steering and photodetector technology. And that will dramatically drive the size, the cost, the power, and we believe enable, over the longer term, the kind of mid- to long-term 3, 4, 5 years, mass deployment of LIDAR. And we got that new technology in terms of that more integrated system capability through the acquisition of Vescent sometime last year. Also in autonomous vehicles, we have several design ins in place with our inertial management units, our IMUs, as we call them. And we're engaged to then almost every self driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well. So that technology, which we've been using, we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example. It's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's used as a failsafe function in the event of a radar system failure. And I will turn to the electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got for our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business that we might have lost or have lost by changing, again, our business logic, as I talked a little earlier about, to tilting towards growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the kind of the cost profile of the products. And we're broadening LTC's customer base, bringing that technology into the strong relationships that legacy ADI has in North America and with European OEMs. Also, our next-generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well. And one other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have and our isolation we have, a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there's a high-voltage and low-voltage connection. So these technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there. And not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies that we've got on the power side of things. My sense is that in a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business, given the design cycles that we've got and the strength of the power portfolio. So I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve. I believe we're focused on the right apps, the right customers. We have a terrific technology story. And with the complementary customer bases and geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. So I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well."

So the way we view it in the short term, there's a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe and particularly in China. So my sense is that there are many other competitors in play who will fill the demand for building out the networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE, so it's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of the headwind for the company last quarter. So I think, overall, most deals are up in communications for ADI we're getting share. You know what, my senses as well, just we're obviously staying close to the situation as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place. But I will tell you, clearly, U.S. and China need each other. And I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. And we're expecting political leaders to figure this out. So my sense is at the end of the day, there's demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building their networks out, to capture the opportunity to build the revenue profit streams. And that demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other."

We continued to be driving this with the technology investments that we've made. It is across the board, C.J. It is all geographies, it is all products. So this is really a combination of the strengths of a global expanding environment, and you know the PMI continues to be an expansionary phase. And that's compounded by the technology investments that have been made over the last several years, which have now come together at a time where you can really see the driver in automation, you can see the driver in our instrumentation business. So it's really across the board, and it's hard to point to any one particular segment because it is so broad based and it's a reflection of the investments that have been made over the last several years. From where we sit today, and you can see it reflected in our guidance for the coming quarter, we feel very strong about the coming quarter. The outlook is solid. Our book-to-bill is greater than 1.

So first, as a reminder, we have not moved to ASC 606, so remember that our revenue is recognized on sell-through from the channel. So we really do provide our investors a reflection of what is the actual activity happening at the customer level. The inventory that we're seeing in our channel now, roughly 7.5 weeks, that's relatively consistent with where we have been. And we would expect, just through the normal course of business and over the course of the rest of the fiscal year, we'd expect to see that come down a bit. The inventory that we have in house is at 116 days. That's an improvement of about 8 days from where we were in the first quarter. We are comfortable kind of in that 115 to 120, so I think that's where you'll see us for the balance of the period. Our sales organization does work very closely with channel partners to monitor that order activity to ensure that we're being mindful of the order lead times and ensuring that, that behavior is appropriate. But again, the biggest metric for us is -- the revenue we're reporting is on sell-through, so it's really not impacted by any noise in the channel, whether they're building or subtracting from inventory."

So at this point, Craig, it's a bit of a guess based on trying to triangulate on all the various conversations we have with carriers and customers. But I think, clearly, we're starting to see the uptick in 4.5G, or as it's called in China, 5G, massive MIMO based on 4G infrastructure at this point.

Well, the second quarter of fiscal '18 was remarkable for ADI. We posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and set a new high-water mark in free cash flow generation, and I'm pleased to share some perspective on our results with you now. So revenue in the second quarter came in just above the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors, offset the expected decline in Consumer. Our results were also supported by our Linear Tech franchise, which posted a record revenue quarter. Gross and operating margin expanded substantially compared to the year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cash flow in the quarter, and our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500. 
Now before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions, and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder. Now I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry, and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high-quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits and nanowatts to kilowatts. It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power and connect these 2 worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction and future important technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality and so on. 
Today, though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth-hungry areas such as high-definition video streaming. Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the addition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The use case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real.  A massive MIMO system can deliver a greater than 3x data capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G base station. And this helps to solve 2 large challenges for carriers: capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50% while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use, on average, 8x the number of radios compared to today's systems. 
Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world. These radios can also scale from small cells to macro base stations to massive MIMO radios, and they offer a flexible architecture capable of rightsizing the analog and digital performance needed by a customer's product family. 
However, to realize the longer-term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity using phased-array solutions. In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges. 
In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete re-architecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This backbone network will be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabit per second download speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications such as digital health care, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors and augmented reality systems. This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. 
5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal chain solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to 3x the [ baum ] when compared to our 4G solutions. 
Now while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. And here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend as we have seen share gains in traditional 4G macro products, thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integrated software-defined transceivers across macro, small cells and massive MIMO trials. 
So in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain knowhow, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite and Linear Technology. So looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future. 
Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I'll continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth."

With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special i",995,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion, above the high end of our guidance and increasing 25% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis. 
Now before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B revenue increased 14% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter. Growth in this market was once again broad based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation and health care continue to drive outperformance. 
Turning to the comms market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter. Sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position on virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comms revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollout, and 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are positioned to provide the enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio. 
Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. After a better than seasonal first quarter, second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year-ago quarter, with growth led by the infotainment and powertrain applications. And finally, our Consumer business represented 13% of sales in the second quarter, and as previously communicated, decreased compared to our year ago quarter. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to the first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. 
Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%.  There is no change to our expectation for fiscal 2019, and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.45, increasing over 40% year-over-year. 
Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decreased 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter, with associated free cash flow margins of 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion. 
During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x, down from the 2.4x in the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our 2x leverage ratio within the next 2 quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million, and we expect CapEx for fiscal '18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. And during the quarter, we paid $178 million in dividends, with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
So let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning for revenue in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. And we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up $10 million year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. 
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52. 
So to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI, and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year-over-year, and our strong operational execution drove gross and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cash flow in the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really kind of 2 phases to 5G, at least from an ADI perspective. There is the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. And the pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G. So our software-defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond. These transceiver technologies, because they're so flexible, are usable as well in places beyond communications. Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in kind of pre-5G systems. But it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe. My sense, Tore, is that U.S. and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 time frame. We'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market, I think, with what they call 5G, which is really to me, 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So I hope that explains what it is we're doing. And in the run up to what will be pure 5G in the 2024, 2025 time frame where the core network gets changed with virtualization, edge computing and pure millimeter wave-type technologies, spanning multiple different frequency levels."

And our objective, obviously, is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. So obviously, we're performing below my expectations, and we're not happy as a management team right now as to where we are. But let me try and unpack this story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So we were clear in our last call that the profiles for ADI and LTC are quite different in the automotive sector today. ADI, we -- the ADI legacy business increased at the kind of level of 2 to 3 SAAR in '17. And it looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level. Whereas the LTC growth level has been in the low single digits or closer to kind of 1 SAAR. So -- but what I will tell you is that we're making a lot of progress in improving LTC's growth rates, and we've uncovered a lot of revenue synergy opportunities. And we've also changed the business logic within LTC and tilted more towards growth. Profitability has always been important, will always be important, but we're also tilting more aggressively towards growth. But as you know, in this market, it just takes time to materialize the design wins that we've got in place. And my sense is those design wins won't materially impact the revenue, will not materially impact the revenue for a couple of years. What I'd like to do is just turn my attention now to giving you a sense for what momentum we have in our business and what we're doing to get our revenue towards -- to get the growth levels to the higher end of the 2 to 3 SAAR. And as you know, we've talked before, we have 3 primary application areas in our business: infotainment, autonomous driving and electrification. I'm going to talk to those in a little bit of detail and try to unpack the story a bit for you. So in infotainment, we've won a lot of premium audio sockets. That's a great heritage for ADI across all geos, and that's really the foundation of the infotainment business. And the good news there is we're now beginning to attach LTC power to the clusters of ADI, DSP and mixed-signal technologies. We've talked before as well about our A2B technologies, and we're really getting a lot of momentum there. And what I can tell you is that about a dozen OEMs are planning to deploy that technology in the next few years across the globe in many, many geos. Now that is also -- everything I talk about here is an opportunity for LTC power attachment. If I turn to autonomous vehicles. We haven't really talked much before about our LIDAR solution, but we're gaining design ins today in long and short-range LIDAR systems, with both the ADI mixed-signal technologies and the LT portfolios and even getting some sockets for Hittite in the very, very high-frequency areas. These components complement the more advanced capability that we're working on now to produce a solid-state beam steering and photodetector technology. And that will dramatically drive the size, the cost, the power, and we believe enable, over the longer term, the kind of mid- to long-term 3, 4, 5 years, mass deployment of LIDAR. And we got that new technology in terms of that more integrated system capability through the acquisition of Vescent sometime last year. Also in autonomous vehicles, we have several design ins in place with our inertial management units, our IMUs, as we call them. And we're engaged today on almost every self driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well. So that technology, which we've been using, we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example. It's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's used as a failsafe function in the event of a radar system failure. And I will turn to the electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got from our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business that we might have lost or have lost and by changing, again, our business logic, as I talked a little earlier about, to tilting towards growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the kind of the cost profile of the products. And we're broadening LTC's customer base, bringing that technology into the strong relationships that legacy ADI has in North America and with European OEMs. Also, our next-generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well. And one other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have, in our isolation we have a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there's a high-voltage and low-voltage connection. So these technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there. And not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies that we've got on the power side of things. My sense is that in a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business, given the design cycles that we've got and the strength of the power portfolio. So I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve. I believe we're focused on the right apps, the right customers. We have a terrific technology story. And with the complementary customer bases and geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. So I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well."

So the way we view it in the short term, there's a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe and particularly in China. So my sense is that there are many other competitors in play who will fill the demand for building out the networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE, so it's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of headwind for the company last quarter. So I think, overall, most geos are up in communications for ADI, we're gaining share. You know, my sense is as well, just we're obviously staying close to the situation as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place. But I will tell you, clearly, U.S. and China need each other. And I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. And we're expecting political leaders to figure this out. So my sense is at the end of the day, there's demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building their networks out, to capture the opportunity to build their revenue and profit streams. And that demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other."

We've stated previously that Consumer will be down 20% to 30% for the year, and this is how the year appears to be trending now.

The inventory that we have in-house is at 116 days. That's an improvement of about 8 days from where we were in the first quarter. We are comfortable kind of in that 115 to 120, so I think that's where you'll see us for the balance of the period. Our sales organization does work very closely with channel partners to monitor that order activity to ensure that we're being mindful of the order lead times and ensuring that, that behavior is appropriate. But again, the biggest metric for us is -- the revenue we're reporting is on sell-through, so it's really not impacted by any noise in the channel, whether they're building or subtracting from inventory."

And it's going to take -- to get to what I would consider to be the objective to put a couple points more of total growth on the company's top line, it will take in the kind of 3 -- 2- to 4-year kind of area. And if Hittite is any indication, given that the technologies play in similar markets, we're virtually 4 years into the closure of the Hittite acquisition. And over that period of time, we have managed to double the growth rates of Hittite in that period of time. So given, Ross, that we expect for every dollar of ADI revenue, which is largely mixed-signal base, we expect $1 of power.

So at this point, Craig, it's a bit of a guess based on trying to triangulate on all the various conversations we have with carriers and customers. But I think, clearly, we're starting to see the uptick in 4.5G, or as it's called in China, 5G, massive MIMO based on 4G infrastructure at this point. So hopefully, that helps to give a bit of clarity to you."

Well, the second quarter of fiscal '18 was remarkable for ADI. We posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and set a new high-water mark in free cash flow generation, and I'm pleased to share some perspective on our results with you now. So revenue in the second quarter came in just above the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors, offset the expected decline in Consumer. Our results were also supported by our Linear Tech franchise, which posted a record revenue quarter. Gross and operating margin expanded substantially compared to the year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cash flow in the quarter, and our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500. 
Now before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions, and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder. Now I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry, and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high-quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits and nanowatts to kilowatts. It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power and connect these 2 worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction and future important technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality and so on. 
Today, though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth-hungry areas such as high-definition video streaming. Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the addition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The use case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real. A massive MIMO system can deliver a greater than 3x data capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G base station. And this helps to solve 2 large challenges for carriers: capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50% while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use, on average, 8x the number of radios compared to today's systems. 
Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world. These radios can also scale from small cells to macro base stations to massive MIMO radios, and they offer a flexible architecture capable of rightsizing the analog and digital performance needed by a customer's product family. 
However, to realize the longer-term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity using phased-array solutions. In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges. 
In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete re-architecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This backbone network will be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabit per second download speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications such as digital health care, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors and augmented reality systems. This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. 
5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal chain solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to 3x the [ baum ] when compared to our 4G solutions. 
Now while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. And here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend as we have seen share gains in traditional 4G macro products, thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integrated software-defined transceivers across macro, small cells and massive MIMO trials. 
So in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain knowhow, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite and Linear Technology. So looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future. 
Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I'll continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion, above the high end of our guidance and increasing 25% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis. 
Now before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B revenue increased 14% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter. Growth in this market was once again broad based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation and health care continue to drive outperformance. 
Turning to the comms market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter. Sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position on virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials. 
As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comms revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollout, and 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are positioned to provide the enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio. 
Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. After a better than seasonal first quarter, second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year-ago quarter, with growth led by the infotainment and powertrain applications. And finally, our Consumer business represented 13% of sales in the second quarter, and as previously communicated, decreased compared to our year ago quarter. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to the first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. 
Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%. There is no change to our expectation for fiscal 2019, and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.45, increasing over 40% year-over-year. 
Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decreased 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter, with associated free cash flow margins of 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion. 
During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x, down from the 2.4x in the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our 2x leverage ratio within the next 2 quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million, and we expect CapEx for fiscal '18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. And during the quarter, we paid $178 million in dividends, with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
So let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning for revenue in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. And we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up $10 million year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. 
Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52. 
So to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI, and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year-over-year, and our strong operational execution drove gross and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cash flow in the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really kind of 2 phases to 5G, at least from an ADI perspective. There is the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. And the pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G. So our software-defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond. These transceiver technologies, because they're so flexible, are usable as well in places beyond communications. Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in kind of pre-5G systems. But it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe. My sense, Tore, is that U.S. and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 time frame. We'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market, I think, with what they call 5G, which is really to me, 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So I hope that explains what it is we're doing.

And our objective, obviously, is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. So obviously, we're performing below my expectations, and we're not happy as a management team right now as to where we are. But let me try and unpack this story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So we were clear in our last call that the profiles for ADI and LTC are quite different in the automotive sector today. ADI, we -- the ADI legacy business increased at the kind of level of 2 to 3 SAAR in '17. And it looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level. Whereas the LTC growth level has been in the low single digits or closer to kind of 1 SAAR. So -- but what I will tell you is that we're making a lot of progress in improving LTC's growth rates, and we've uncovered a lot of revenue synergy opportunities. And we've also changed the business logic within LTC and tilted more towards growth. Profitability has always been important, will always be important, but we're also tilting more aggressively towards growth. But as you know, in this market, it just takes time to materialize the design wins that we've got in place. And my sense is those design wins won't materially impact the revenue, will not materially impact the revenue for a couple of years. What I'd like to do is just turn my attention now to giving you a sense for what momentum we have in our business and what we're doing to get our revenue towards -- to get the growth levels to the higher end of the 2 to 3 SAAR. And as you know, we've talked before, we have 3 primary application areas in our business: infotainment, autonomous driving and electrification. I'm going to talk to those in a little bit of detail and try to unpack the story a bit for you. So in infotainment, we've won a lot of premium audio sockets. That's a great heritage for ADI across all geos, and that's really the foundation of the infotainment business. And the good news there is we're now beginning to attach LTC power to the clusters of ADI, DSP and mixed-signal technologies. We've talked before as well about our A2B technologies, and we're really getting a lot of momentum there. And what I can tell you is that about a dozen OEMs are planning to deploy that technology in the next few years across the globe in many, many geos. Now that is also -- everything I talk about here is an opportunity for LTC power attachment. If I turn to autonomous vehicles. We haven't really talked much before about our LIDAR solution, but we're gaining design ins today in long and short-range LIDAR systems, with both the ADI mixed-signal technologies and the LT portfolios and even getting some sockets for Hittite in the very, very high-frequency areas. These components complement the more advanced capability that we're working on now to produce a solid-state beam steering and photodetector technology. And that will dramatically drive the size, the cost, the power, and we believe enable, over the longer term, the kind of mid- to long-term 3, 4, 5 years, mass deployment of LIDAR. And we got that new technology in terms of that more integrated system capability through the acquisition of Vescent sometime last year. Also in autonomous vehicles, we have several design ins in place with our inertial management units, our IMUs, as we call them. And we're engaged today on almost every self driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well. So that technology, which we've been using, we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example. It's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's used as a failsafe function in the event of a radar system failure. And I will turn to the electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got from our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business that we might have lost or have lost and by changing, again, our business logic, as I talked a little earlier about, to tilting towards growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the kind of the cost profile of the products. And we're broadening LTC's customer base, bringing that technology into the strong relationships that legacy ADI has in North America and with European OEMs. Also, our next-generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well. And one other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have, in our isolation we have a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there's a high-voltage and low-voltage connection. So these technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there. And not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies that we've got on the power side of things. My sense is that in a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business, given the design cycles that we've got and the strength of the power portfolio. So I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve. I believe we're focused on the right apps, the right customers. We have a terrific technology story. And with the complementary customer bases and geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. So I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well."

So the way we view it in the short term, there's a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe and particularly in China. So my sense is that there are many other competitors in play who will fill the demand for building out the networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE, so it's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of headwind for the company last quarter. So I think, overall, most geos are up in communications for ADI, we're gaining share. You know, my sense is as well, just we're obviously staying close to the situation as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place. But I will tell you, clearly, U.S. and China need each other. And I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. And we're expecting political leaders to figure this out. So my sense is at the end of the day, there's demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building their networks out, to capture the opportunity to build their revenue and profit streams. And that demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other."

We're expecting, looking into our -- somewhere in the back end of third quarter and fourth quarter, we're expecting what is normally a seasonally strong quarter to be so. We've stated previously that Consumer will be down 20% to 30% for the year, and this is how the year appears to be trending now.

So first, as a reminder, we have not moved to ASC 606, so remember that our revenue is recognized on sell-through from the channel. So we really do provide our investors a reflection of what is the actual activity happening at the customer level. The inventory that we're seeing in our channel now, roughly 7.5 weeks, that's relatively consistent with where we have been. And we would expect, just through the normal course of business and over the course of the rest of the fiscal year, we'd expect to see that come down a bit. The inventory that we have in-house is at 116 days. That's an improvement of about 8 days from where we were in the first quarter. We are comfortable kind of in that 115 to 120, so I think that's where you'll see us for the balance of the period. Our sales organization does work very closely with channel partners to monitor that order activity to ensure that we're being mindful of the order lead times and ensuring that, that behavior is appropriate.

Can you give us an idea, given the long-term design cycles, and I know it's not going to be immediate, but when should we as investors start to see the benefits of those tweaks to the admittedly successful Linear model turning to a little bit more growth-centric?"

We have sockets already in place now that we should see the uptake on. And it's going to take -- to get to what I would consider to be the objective to put a couple points more of total growth on the company's top line, it will take in the kind of 3 -- 2- to 4-year kind of area. And if Hittite is any indication, given that the technologies play in similar markets, we're virtually 4 years into the closure of the Hittite acquisition. And over that period of time, we have managed to double the growth rates of Hittite in that period of time. So given, Ross, that we expect for every dollar of ADI revenue, which is largely mixed-signal base, we expect $1 of power. That's the kind of opportunity spread we're looking at, but it's going to take us 2 to 4 years, I think, to see any meaningful change to the top line."

If we look back at the transition from 2G to 3G, and then 3G to 4G, as you look ahead and look at 5G and the potential for 5G to impact ADI revenues, the questions I have are, one, how do you expect pacing in the 4G to 5G revenue transition to compare to prior transitions? When do you think we get to a point where 5G would be a majority of communications revenue? And relative to some of the growth rates that you talked about earlier on a subsegment basis, would you expect 5G when it becomes a much more material part of revenues, to accelerate those growth rates?"

So somewhere between 2022 and 2025, we'll start to see what we will consider to be 5G become a more dominant part of our wireless communications infrastructure revenue. So at this point, Craig, it's a bit of a guess based on trying to triangulate on all the various conversations we have with carriers and customers. But I think, clearly, we're starting to see the uptick in 4.5G, or as it's called in China, 5G, massive MIMO based on 4G infrastructure at this point. So hopefully, that helps to give a bit of clarity to you."

Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. 
In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. 
We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. 
Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This manufacturing, in which cyber physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a vast deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go-to edge solution provider, the place where the data is born, so to speak. And I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. 
Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transaction to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and we were in the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio the targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. 
At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and SAEs. And the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities with current customers and increase penetration of new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end market such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others. And this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. 
With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC as high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power-play is an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate the space in energy-constrained areas. For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously and achievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. 
Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technologies to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our high coupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also removed customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. 
As a result of all that, we've shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digit annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. 
The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remain healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-controlled technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our constant opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. 
The secondary of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including POC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high performance position signal-processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adopted more easily, and these changes that could conditionally take hours can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins of meeting customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. 
As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless network and technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industry-already Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security requirements in the hostile environment of the digital factory.  
Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical ware of the machines to maximize factory uptime. 
So to summarize at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for controlling position, our new investments double our SAM that allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. 
So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth who will take you through the financials."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018, earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record selling quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. Growth in this market continues to be broad-based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. 
In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. 
Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. 
And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter, and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disty inventory was just [ above ] 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. 
During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's press release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40 -- 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. 
Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. 
Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15x over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. 
So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets. It's in good shape in the channel. And I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's -- I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is ADI's position. 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G. And we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have, the key customers and wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there is a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the back hold, the optical back hold. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level. So it's, I'd say, moderate but very, very important part of what we're doing."

And we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And as we look at the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margins, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020. So we still expect to be able to continue to drive the gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business."

So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single-digit area and the LT part in the low single digits arena. So there are 2 primary components, I would say, there were working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things. Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the battery management business, gets back into a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding onto the sockets that we've had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe and electric power train. And we've also got a couple of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We were leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take off our fair share of high performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next year and a half, 2 years. But somewhere in the 2020 area, I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve."

So I'd say in industrial business now is good. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties, primarily in the geopolitical arena as people think through what this tariff situation means for everybody. But I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digits growth again here on an annual basis. So I would say in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. So what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, the demand is strong. I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth and probably at the higher end of that."

That's my sense. The backhaul market particularly, the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by the market conditions are better. I think in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop. And we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market. And right now, even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in the kind of the low, I would say, double-digit area for the foreseeable future.

I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion-plus on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million-plus of that is committed to the dividend. And as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it mid- to high- 30s of our free cash flow. That leaves fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand. And then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet? And what do we need to do to maintain investment-grade so we have the flexibility that we need? So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and will be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage."

When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate. And we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes about -- a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's a $4.5 billion-ish today. Today is kind of revenue levels that legacy LT power should be a 1 for 1 match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation."

Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. 
In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. 
We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. 
Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. 
For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. 
For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go-to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. 
Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and we where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. 
At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs, and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities of current customers and increase penetration of new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. 
For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end market such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others, and this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. 
With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC add high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power play is an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy-constrained areas. 
For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. 
Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technologies to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. 
So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also removed customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. 
As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digit annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. 
The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remain healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. 
Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-controlled technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. 
The secondary of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. 
In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adopted more easily, and these changes that could traditionally take hours can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. 
As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics, will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. 
In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless network and technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.  
Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical ware of the machines to maximize factory uptime. 
So to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our SAM and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. 
So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth who will take you through the financials."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. 
Growth in this market continues to be broad based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. 
In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. 
Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. 
And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. 
Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disti inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. 
And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx, as a percentage of sales, will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40% to -- excuse me, 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. 
Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. 
With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15x over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. 
As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. 
So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets, it's in good shape in the channel and I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's, I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is ADI's position and 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G, and we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers and wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the back hold, the optical back hold. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level and so it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing."

So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading, and we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix decline to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020, so we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish."

Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business, gets back into a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding on to the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We -- we're leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take our unfair share of high-performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next 1.5 years, 2 years. But somewhere in the 2020 area, I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve."

You've seen PMI and GDP remain solid across the globe, the PMIs and GDP. I've spoken with several customers and they remain optimistic as well about the future. So I'd say, in industrial business now is good. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties, primarily in the geopolitical arena and as people think through what this tariff situation means for everybody, but I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth, again, here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. And so what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, though demand is strong, I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth level and probably at the higher end of that."

Good questions, Chris. So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area in particular, my sense is that even though it's a very, very lumpy business when you look at it quarter-by-quarter, with 4G continuing to deploy with new architectures and 5G coming on board, my sense is that can be a double-digit kind of a 10% growth area for ADI for kind of the next 3, 4 years. That's my sense. The backhaul market, particularly the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by -- the market conditions are better. I think, in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market. And right now, even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in the kind of the low, I would say, double-digit area for the foreseeable future. And I'll turn it over to Prashanth to answer the gross margin implication question."

And as Vince mentioned, as we see more growth in that comms business, which is what we would expect for 2019, that is going to drive a little bit of mix on the margins. So probably more to be in line with flattish to what we're expecting Q4 to be.

So I guess, the way that I would guide folks to think about the -- about our repurchase activity. I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion-plus on a trailing 12-month basis and we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million-plus of that is committed to the dividend, and as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it, mid- to high- 30s of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand, and then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and will be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage."

And at a very high level, our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat, the breadth and depth of our competitive moat from an innovation standpoint.

And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate and we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish starting revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's $4.5 billion-ish today, today's kind of revenue levels, that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win, in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation."

Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. 
In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. 
We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. 
Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. 
For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. 
For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. 
Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. 
At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs, and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. 
For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end markets such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others, and this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. 
With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC adds high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy-constrained areas. 
For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. 
Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. 
So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also remove customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. 
As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digits annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. 
The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. 
Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-control technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. 
The second area of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. 
In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adapted more easily, and these changes that could traditionally take hours, can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. 
As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. 
In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless networking technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.  
Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical wear of the machines to maximize factory uptime. 
So to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our SAM and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. 
So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financials."

With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in to",1184,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. 
Growth in this market continues to be broad based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. 
In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. 
Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. 
And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. 
Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disti inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. 
And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx, as a percentage of sales, will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40% to -- excuse me, 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. 
Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. 
With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. 
As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. 
So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets, it's in good shape in the channel and I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's, I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is -- ADI's position in 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G, and we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers in wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the backhaul, the optical backhaul. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level and so it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing."

So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading, and we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020, so we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish."

So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single-digit area and the LT part in the low single-digits arena. So there are 2 primary components, I would say, that we're working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things. Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business, gets back onto a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding on to the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We -- we're leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take our unfair share of high-performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next 1.5 years, 2 years. But somewhere in the 2020 area, I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve."

As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties, primarily in the geopolitical arena and as people think through what the -- this tariff situation means for everybody, but I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth, again, here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. And so what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, though demand is strong, I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth level and probably at the higher end of that."

So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area in particular, my sense is that even though it's a very, very lumpy business",255,"Yes. Good questions, Chris. So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area in particular, my sense is that even though it's a very, very lumpy business when you look at it quarter-by-quarter, with 4G continuing to deploy with new architectures and 5G coming on board, my sense is that can be a double-digit kind of a 10% growth area for ADI for kind of the next 3, 4 years. That's my sense. The backhaul market, particularly the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by -- the market conditions are better. I think, in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market. And right now, even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in the kind of the low, I would say, double-digit area for the foreseeable future. And I'll turn it over to Prashanth to answer the gross margin implication question."

We are, as you know, we're still ahead of our long-term model of 70%. Our industrial business has very rich gross margins. Our comms business has great margins, but not as strong as the industrial. And as Vince mentioned, as we see more growth in that comms business, which is what we would expect for 2019, that is going to drive a little bit of mix on the margins. So probably more to be in line with flattish to what we're expecting Q4 to be. On top of that, so I do want to remind folks, we are looking at about $100 million of cost synergies that should be modeled in for future sort -- of in the late 2020, early 2021 closing both the facilities, the one in Singapore and the one in the Bay Area in Santa -- in California."

So I guess, the way that I'd guide folks to think about the -- about our repurchase activity. I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion-plus on a trailing 12-month basis and we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million-plus of that is committed to the dividend, and as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it, mid- to high- 30s of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand, and then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and we'll be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage."

The long-term value of our investments, both organic as well as inorganic, will continue to drive the long-term profitable growth trajectory for ADI. Our approach to acquisitions has been and will continue to be very disciplined. And at a very high level, our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat, the breadth and depth of our competitive moat from an innovation standpoint. So our goal, really, is to acquire technologies and engineering capabilities that will enhance us, make our portfolio more complete to meet the demands of the markets and customers in the future, and basically increase our overall ability to deliver increasing value to our customers. That's the path we're on and that's the path we'll continue to be on. And you know, I'm not going to talk about specific targets, we've got a successful track record. And what we're looking at -- we're always looking, but our standards are very, very high. So this was the case when we acquired Hittite and Linear, LTC and also the myriad smaller things we've done over the last 3 or 4 years.

And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate and we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish starting revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it, just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's $4.5 billion-ish today, at today's kind of revenue levels, that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation."

Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. 
In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. 
We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. 
Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. 
For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. 
For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. 
Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. 
At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs, and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. 
For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end markets such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others, and this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. 
With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC adds high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy-constrained areas. 
For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. 
Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. 
So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also remove customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. 
As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digits annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. 
The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. 
Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-control technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. 
The second area of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. 
In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adapted more easily, and these changes that could traditionally take hours, can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. 
As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. 
In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless networking technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.  
Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical wear of the machines to maximize factory uptime. 
So to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our SAM and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. 
So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financials."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. 
Growth in this market continues to be broad based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. 
In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. 
Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. 
And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. 
Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disti inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. 
And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx, as a percentage of sales, will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40% to -- excuse me, 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. 
Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. 
With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. 
As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. 
So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets, it's in good shape in the channel and I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's, I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is -- ADI's position in 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G, and we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers in wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the backhaul, the optical backhaul. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level and so it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing."

So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading, and we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020, so we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish."

So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single-digit area and the LT part in the low single-digits arena. So there are 2 primary components, I would say, that we're working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things. Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business, gets back onto a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding on to the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We -- we're leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take our unfair share of high-performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next 1.5 years, 2 years.

And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth, again, here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens.

That's my sense. The backhaul market, particularly the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by -- the market conditions are better. I think, in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain.

That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand, and then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and we'll be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage."

Well, our overall capital allocation framework, as Prashanth outlined, hasn't changed very much. The long-term value of our investments, both organic as well as inorganic, will continue to drive the long-term profitable growth trajectory for ADI. Our approach to acquisitions has been and will continue to be very disciplined. And at a very high level, our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat, the breadth and depth of our competitive moat from an innovation standpoint. So our goal, really, is to acquire technologies and engineering capabilities that will enhance us, make our portfolio more complete to meet the demands of the markets and customers in the future, and basically increase our overall ability to deliver increasing value to our customers. That's the path we're on and that's the path we'll continue to be on. And you know, I'm not going to talk about specific targets, we've got a successful track record. And what we're looking at -- we're always looking, but our standards are very, very high. So this was the case when we acquired Hittite and Linear, LTC and also the myriad smaller things we've done over the last 3 or 4 years. So I'm very pleased with where we are now in terms of our overall portfolio, but we're always on the look as the markets evolve and customers' needs evolve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a philosophical view of how we think about M&A."

And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate and we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish starting revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it, just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's $4.5 billion-ish today, at today's kind of revenue levels, that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation."

Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. 
In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. 
We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. 
Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. 
For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. 
For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. 
Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. 
At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs, and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. 
For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end markets such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others, and this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. 
With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC adds high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy-constrained areas. 
For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. 
Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. 
So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also remove customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. 
As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digits annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. 
The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. 
Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-control technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. 
The second area of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. 
In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adapted more easily, and these changes that could traditionally take hours, can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. 
As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. 
In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless networking technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.  
Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical wear of the machines to maximize factory uptime. 
So to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our SAM and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. 
So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financials."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. 
Growth in this market continues to be broad based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. 
In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. 
Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. 
And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. 
Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disti inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. 
And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. 
All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx, as a percentage of sales, will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40% to -- excuse me, 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. 
Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. 
With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. 
As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. 
So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session."

So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets, it's in good shape in the channel and I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's, I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is -- ADI's position in 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G, and we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers in wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the backhaul, the optical backhaul. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level and so it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing."

So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading, and we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020, so we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish."

So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single-digit area and the LT part in the low single-digits arena. So there are 2 primary components, I would say, that we're working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things. Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business, gets back onto a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding on to the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We -- we're leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take our unfair share of high-performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next 1.5 years, 2 years.

So I'd say, in industrial business now is good. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties, primarily in the geopolitical arena and as people think through what the -- this tariff situation means for everybody, but I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth, again, here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. And so what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, though demand is strong, I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth level and probably at the higher end of that."

That's my sense. The backhaul market, particularly the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by -- the market conditions are better. I think, in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market.

So I guess, the way that I'd guide folks to think about the -- about our repurchase activity. I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion-plus on a trailing 12-month basis and we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million-plus of that is committed to the dividend, and as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it, mid- to high- 30s of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand, and then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and we'll be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage."

And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate and we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish starting revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it, just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's $4.5 billion-ish today, at today's kind of revenue levels, that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation."

We're very pleased to report that ADI had another another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share. Looking at the full year now, revenues surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double-digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduced our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders. As we outlined on the last call, going forward, we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases. Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI also. So I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best of both approach, employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers. Our combined sales force has made really great strides in delivering and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market. During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside. All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog RF power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts. We exited 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019 namely: in mutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customer's business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers. And we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. For example, in the wireless communication sector, you have may have seen recent press around deployments in 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands of pro spectral space, thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for its customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios contain an 8x increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI, and the opportunity to capture potentially up to 4x the content when compared to current 4G solutions. I should note also that in addition, power management attached assignments in this area are just beginning but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter-wave-based future generations. Here Carriers we look to increase the radio channel count of up to 512 channels per radio and we're very well positioned to, once again, solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting-edge portfolio. So I believe, we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space. So now turning for a moment to the industrial sector. Here, the digital factory envisioned by industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control, isolation and power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial grade Ethernet and sensors in areas, such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market. In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress, and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future's equally bright here. We're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation, like A to B and C to B media transport technologies and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector. On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technologies is required to deliver ever-increasing levels of precision in Level 3 plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with by, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles. In the electrification application area, we've made a stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the batteries' useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap, while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multigenerational road map includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future. And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our health care business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past 5 years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas, such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers. For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago, we've made a pivot to domain-inspired approach to solve our customer's most difficult problems. We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component-based building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits, for example. These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers design challenges, while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We've thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general, in the health care area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI. So in closing, I put forth a constructive scenario here today, and while some maybe a bit skeptical, given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that present our world, our confidence I believe is very well-founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year, and we've deepened our customer engagements. So we're in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace. And amidst the environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create ever more innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately, drives returns for our shareholders. And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We wrapped up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow, generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of the sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most the sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter led by strength in instrumentation, health care, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China. The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter increased, once again, at the double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad-based, and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI. Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application. And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected. Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high-end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year, and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were a record at 43%. As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million, and with our full year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at about $0.55. Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially, and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disti inventory declined sequentially, and exited the year right in line with our target of 6 to 8 weeks. We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt, we paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2. As of yesterday, we repurchased nearly 260 million worth of shares. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019. Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related cost for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor. We plan to provide a historical, quarterly end-market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning, you will see changes in our historical growth rates as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by the plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. Now onto guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, are also on a non-GAAP basis that exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week. So we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison. First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint on both the old and the new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard as well as a sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis, and we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase low double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are piling for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lower sequentially digital shutdowns around the holidays as well as business mix. We're expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially, and thus, include some onetime items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41%. And we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million, and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28, plus or minus $0.07. Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns the way we manage the business, that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion. So all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI, and while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session."

In the atmosphere of the kind of macro uncertainty, driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth, and the impact of tariffs, I'd say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic, though there is obviously, concern, which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx, and taking a long-term view to demand. So I would say, at this point in time, what we're seeing though is cancellations are the kind of a normal rate, and lead times, for the most part, are pretty normal. So in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say, in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China, and we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business. Obviously, health care has remained strong for the company. And I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or 2. So I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over the past -- really the past decade. So I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been in that market. It is our #1 focus, I would say, and in it's broad, it's deep, it's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond."

I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated buildout of, I would say, enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So what I'm saying is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and the -- I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands. When you look at the -- if you put the whole thing together, we're looking at our '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds, and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last 3 years, I'd say. Hittite incidentally -- just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here. When we inquired Hittite, it was roughly a $217 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time. And it isn't just communications, it's where microwave and those really frequency technologies are used and aerospace and defense and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market. So I think, when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G, some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said, in the prepared remarks, my sense is that, we've got a 4x content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. So it's -- and that, by the way, doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LTE in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think, the tailwinds are strong, and ADI's content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger. So that's what we're seeing. I think, I'd say, it's a share gain story for ADI."

All that said, we're still expecting that consumer will decline somewhere between 10%, 20% on the portable side in '18, while the prosumer portable business, which looks a lot more like a B2B sector is continuing to perform well for the company. So I think, the way to look at this, John, after this year's growth will be determined by essentially new sockets, either what we win or what we lose. That will determine, ultimately, what happens, I think, after '19. But it's always, we're optimistic about where we're playing consumer, and we'll continue to be selective in the areas that we target. And we're always seeking to increase diversity of application and customers, so I think, that's the snapshot of consumer at this point."

And we're also now, getting the benefit of adding LTC's silent switcher technology into some of these sockets as well. So we're at the early stages of an operant in our power business there. I think it's well publicized during the year that we had some -- we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solutions technology. But I think we've really turned the corner of particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth, and we expect '19 also to be a double-digit growth pro forma for ADI. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we're something our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity. On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of these in the prepared remarks across radar. We've got our -- we're sampling our 77 gigahertz image quality radar. We have very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LT and ABI mixed-signal technologies. Many customers are starting to use our IMU, the inertial management units in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving areas. So I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get a path to a growth trajectory. And a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous goals as well. So hopefully, Craig, that frames it out for you."

I'd say, as we've come out of the year, all markets have increased year-over-year. Growth was led by China, and I'd say, looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down. And no big moves one way or another to report there. Industrial was up year-on-year, it was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again, a little quarter -- a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects there, China, this new testing modality that's being adapted in Europe. But we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target.

It's a level -- it's the macro uncertainty that's causing customers to be a little cautious. Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say -- as I've just said cancellations are just normal. And just to give you a little more depth of color on that. The legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal 4- to 6-week window that we intend to report. LTE is a little more mixed. We've had some, I would say, tightening of supply. Demand has been strong, and the supply has been a little tight. But we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity. In fact, over the last couple of quarters, to support not just today's of shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So the book-to-bill as just, as Prashanth said, it's just a little bit below parity on the B2B side, driven largely by industrial. So -- but I think the book-to-bill that we've given that we're seeing is a very supportive of the guidance that we put out there."

I'd say, I mean it's very hard to parcel it precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we, as a company, have we retooled the entire strategy of the company, 8, 9, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% for R&D in the B2B spaces. And most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B areas. So the addition of the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well. We have been taking share, that I'm sure of and believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking. PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been a strong. And so obviously, the environment is strong, but I think ADI's executing in a more focused, more intense way as well in capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- think a more moderated growth range. We've said that, for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business, kind of 2 to 3x GDP, we will be content on an ongoing basis, and that's my sense for '19 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that -- that's what we're going to see again and we're going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year."

So I think first off, there are many, many solution variance out there when -- between the antenna and the bit streams, so to speak. And there's -- we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from -- right from the antenna, down into the bitstream area. So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially 4x the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last 5, 7 years. And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, the -- we have -- again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect it in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs, so as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of 8, 10-plus in terms of potential content. Just given the channel count on the radio transceivers, which by the way, is where most of the innovation has taken place in these 5G systems, at least until they virtualized in the early '20s or so. So there's -- there are kind of 3 or 4 major building blocks in these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver, there's the massive MIMO addition, there's all these power technology we can bring to as well to our customers. And then there's the digital basement, the digital front-end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side, and those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations, but in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined that with our convertible technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So my sense is, over the next, say, 5 years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of 3 to 4x, and then it's a question of how many radios deploy. And -- but we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint."

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company.

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share. 
Looking at the full year now, revenues surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double-digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. 
This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduced our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders. As we outlined on the last call, going forward, we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases. 
Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI, also. So I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. 
Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best-of-both approach, employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers. Our combined sales force has made really great strides in delivering and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market. 
During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside. All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, RF and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts. 
We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019 namely: immutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers' business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers, and we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. 
For example, in the wireless communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands of -- for spectral space, thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios contain an 8x increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI and the opportunity to capture, potentially, up to 4x the content when compared to current 4G solutions. 
I should note also that in addition, power management attached assignments in this area are just beginning but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter-wave-based future generations. Here, carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio and we're very well positioned to, once again, solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting-edge portfolio. So I believe, we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space. 
So now turning for a moment to the industrial sector. Here, the digital factory envisioned by industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control, isolation and power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial-grade deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas, such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market.
In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future is equally bright here, we're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation, like A2B and C2B media transport technologies, and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector. 
On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever-increasing levels of precision in Level 3-plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles. 
In the electrification application area, we've made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the batteries' useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap, while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multigenerational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future. 
And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our health care business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past 5 years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers. For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago, we made a pivot to a domain-inspired approach to solve our customer's most difficult problems. 
We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits, for example. These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers design challenges, while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We've thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general, in the health care area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI. 
So in closing, I put forth a constructive scenario here today, and while some maybe a bit skeptical given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that present our world, our confidence, I believe, is very well-founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year and we've deepened our customer engagements. 
So we're in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace. And amidst an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create evermore innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately, drives returns for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We wrapped up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue of $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. 
But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of the sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most of the sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter led by strength in instrumentation, health care, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China. 
The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter increased, once again, at the double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad-based, and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI. 
Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application. 
And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected. Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year, and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were a record at 43%. 
As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million. And with our full year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at about $0.55. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disti inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of 6 to 8 weeks. We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. 
During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt and paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2. As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly 260 million worth of shares. 
CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019. Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related cost for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor. 
We plan to provide a historical, quarterly end-market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning, you will see changes in our historical growth rates as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. 
Now on to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week, so we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison. 
First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint, on both the old and the new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard as well as a sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis and we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase low double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. 
Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lower sequentially due to the shutdowns around the holidays as well as business mix. We're expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially and thus include some onetime items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. 
We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41% and we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07. 
Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business, that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion. 
So all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session."

In the atmosphere of the kind of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth and the impacts of tariffs, I'd say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic though there is, obviously, concern which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand. So I would say, at this point in time, what we're seeing though is cancellations are the kind of a normal rate and lead times, for the most part, are pretty normal. So in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say, in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China. And we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business. Obviously, health care has remained strong for the company. And I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or 2, so I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over the past -- really, the past decade. So I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been on that market. It is our #1 focus, I would say, and in it's broad, it's deep, it's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond."

So let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated build-out of, I would say, enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So what I'm saying is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and the -- I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands. When you look at the -- put the whole thing together, we're looking at '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last 3 years, I'd say. Hittite incidentally, just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here, when we inquired Hittite, it was roughly a $270 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time. And it isn't just communications, it's where microwave and those radio frequency technologies are used and aerospace and defense and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market. So I think, when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G, as some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we've got a 4x content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. So it's -- and that, by the way, doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LT in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think, the tailwinds are strong and ADI's content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger, so that's what we're seeing. I think it's a share gain story for ADI."

All that said, we're still expecting that consumer will decline somewhere between 10%, 20% on the portable side in '18, while the prosumer part of our business, which looks a lot more like a B2B sector is continuing to perform well for the company. So I think, the way to look at this, John, after this year's growth will be determined by essentially new sockets, either what we win or what we lose. That will determine, ultimately, what happens, I think, after '19. But it's always, we're optimistic about where we're playing consumer and we'll continue to be selective in the areas that we target and we're always seeking to increase diversity of application and customers, so I think that's the snapshot of consumer at this point."

And yes, the A2B application space is growing for the company. We've added this in new media transport modality as well that we call C2B. And we're also now getting the benefit of adding LTC silent switcher technology into some of these sockets as well, so we're at the early stages of an operant in our power business there. I think as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solution technology. But I think we've really turned the corner, particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth and we expect '19, also, to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we're something our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity. On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of these in the prepared remarks across radar. We've got our -- we're sampling our 77-gigahertz image quality radar. We have a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LT and ADI mixed-signal technologies. And many customers are starting to use our IMU, inertial management units, in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving area. So I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get it back to a growth trajectory, and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous goals as well. So hopefully, Craig, that frames it up for you."

It was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again, a little quarter -- a little weaker quarter-on-quarter.

Certainly, we're headed into the holiday season, so our factory utilizations normally unaligned a bit for those that are impacted by Thanksgiving and then again for the Christmas, New Year period.

In terms of booking activities, certainly, our industrial business is seeing book-to-bill below parity and it's been a while since we've seen that.

Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say -- as I've just said cancellations are just normal. And just to give you a little more depth of color on that, so the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal 4- to 6-week window that we're planning to report. LTE is a little more mixed. We've had some, I would say, tightening of supply. Demand has been strong and supply has been a little tight, but we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity. In fact, over the last couple of quarters, to support not just today's of shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So the book-to-bill as just -- as Prashanth said, just a little below parity on the B2B side driven largely by industrial.

So I'd say -- I mean, it's very hard to parse out precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we, as a company, have -- we retooled the entire strategy of the company, 8, 9, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% for R&D in the B2B spaces and most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B areas. So the addition of the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well. We have been taking share, that I'm sure of, and I believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking. PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been strong. So obviously, the environment is strong, but I think ADI is executing in a more focused, more intense way as well in capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- I think a more moderated growth range. We've said that, for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business, kind of 2 to 3x GDP, we would be content on an ongoing basis. And that's my sense for '19 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that -- that's what we're going to see again in the -- we're going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year."

So I think, first off, there are many, many solution variance out there when -- between the antenna and the bit streams, so to speak. And there's -- we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from -- right from the antenna, down into the bit stream area. So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially 4x the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last 5, 7 years. And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, the -- we have, again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of 8, 10 plus in terms of potential content just given the channel count on the radio transceivers which, by the way, is where most of the innovation has taken place in these 5G systems, at least, until they virtualized in the early '20s or so. So there's -- there are kind of 3 or 4 major building blocks in these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver, there's the massive MIMO addition, there's all these power technology that we can bring to bear now as well to our customers. And then there's the digital base-end, the digital front-end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side. And those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations. But in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined it with our converter technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So my sense is, over the next, say, 5 years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of 3 to 4x, and then it's a question of how many radios to deploy. And -- but we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint."

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share. 
Looking at the full year now, revenues surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double-digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. 
This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduced our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders. As we outlined on the last call, going forward, we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases. 
Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI, also. So I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. 
Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best-of-both approach. Employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers. Our combined sales force has made really great strides in building and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market. 
During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside. All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, RF and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts. 
We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019, namely: immutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers' business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers, and we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. 
For example, in the wireless communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI's software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands of -- for spectral space, thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios contain an 8x increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI and the opportunity to capture, potentially, up to 4x the content when compared to current 4G solutions. 
I should note also that in addition, power management attached assignments in this area are just beginning but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter-wave-based future generations. Here, carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio and we're very well positioned to, once again, solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting-edge portfolio. So I believe we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space. 
So now turning for a moment to the industrial sector. Here, the digital factory envisioned by industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control, isolation and power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial-grade deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market.
In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future is equally bright here. We're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation, like A2B and C2B media transport technologies, and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector. 
On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever-increasing levels of precision in Level 3-plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles. 
In the electrification application area, we've made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the batteries' useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multigenerational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future. 
And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our health care business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past 5 years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers. For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago, we made a pivot to a domain-inspired approach to solve our customers' most difficult problems. 
We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits, for example. These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers' design challenges while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We've thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general, in the health care area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI. 
So in closing, I put forth a constructive scenario here today, and while some may be a bit skeptical given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that beset our world, our confidence, I believe, is very well-founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year and we've deepened our customer engagements. 
So we're in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace. And amidst an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create ever more innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately drives returns for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We wrap up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. 
But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of the sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter led by strength in instrumentation, health care, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China. 
The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter, increased once again at the double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad-based, and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI. 
Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application. 
And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year, and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were a record at 43%. 
As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million. And with our full year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at about $0.55. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disti inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of 6 to 8 weeks. We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. 
During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt and paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2. As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly 260 million worth of shares. 
CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related cost for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor. 
We plan to provide a historical, quarterly end-market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning, you will see changes in our historical growth rates as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. 
Now on to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week, so we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison. 
First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint, on both the old and the new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard as well as a sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis and we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase low double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. 
Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lower sequentially due to the normal shutdowns around the holidays as well as business mix. We're expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially and does include some onetime items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. 
We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41% and we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07. 
Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business; that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion. 
So all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session."

In the atmosphere of the kind of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth and the impacts of the tariffs, I'd say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic though there is, obviously, concern which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand. So I would say, at this point in time, what we're seeing though is cancellations are at a kind of a normal rate and lead times, for the most part, are pretty normal. So in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say, in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China. And we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business. Obviously, health care has remained strong for the company. And I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or 2, so I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over the past -- really, the past decade. So I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been in that market. It is our #1 focus, I would say, and it's broad, it's deep, it's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond."

Maybe you can help allay some of those concerns and just give us a little bit more detail there."

So let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated build-out of, I would say, enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So what I'm seeing is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and the -- I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands. When you look at the -- put the whole thing together, we're looking at '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last 3 years, I'd say. Hittite incidentally, just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here, when we inquired Hittite, it was roughly a $270 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time. And it isn't just communications, it's where microwave and those radio frequency technologies are used and aerospace and defense and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market. So I think, when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G, as some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we've got a 4x content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. So it's -- and that, by the way, doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LT in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think, the tailwinds are strong and ADI's content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger, so that's what we're seeing. I think it's a share gain story for ADI."

And yes, the A2B application space is growing for the company. We've added this new media transport modality as well that we call C2B. And we're also now getting the benefit of adding LTC silent switcher technology into some of these sockets as well, so we're at the early stages of an operant in our power business there. I think as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solution technology. But I think we've really turned the corner, particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth and we expect '19, also, to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we're sampling our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity. On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of this in the prepared remarks across radar. We've got our -- we're sampling our 77-gigahertz image quality radar. We've a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LT and ADI mixed-signal technologies. And many customers are starting to use our IMU, inertial management units, in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving area. So I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get it back to a growth trajectory, and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous VD goals as well. So hopefully, Craig, that frames it up for you."

And I'd say, looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down and no big moves one way or another to report there. Industrial was up year-on-year. It was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again, a little quarter -- a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects there, SAR, China, this new testing modality that's being adopted in Europe, so -- but we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target.

Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say -- as I've just said, cancellations are just normal. And just to give you a little more depth of color on that, so the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal 4- to 6-week window that we're planning to report. LTE is a little more mixed. We've had some, I would say, tightening of supply. Demand has been strong and supply has been a little tight, but we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity, in fact, over the last couple of quarters, to support not just today's shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So the book-to-bill as just -- as Prashanth said, just a little below parity on the B2B side, driven largely by industrial.

So I'd say -- I mean, it's very hard to parse out precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we, as a company, have -- we retooled the entire strategy of the company, 8, 9, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% for R&D in the B2B spaces and most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B areas. So the addition of the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well. We have been taking share, that I'm sure of, and I believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking. PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been strong. So obviously, the environment is strong, but I think ADI is executing in a more focused, more intense way as well in capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- I think a more moderated growth range. We've said that, for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business, kind of 2x to 3x GDP, we would be content on an ongoing basis. And that's my sense for '19 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that -- that's what we're going to see again in the -- we're going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year."

So I think, first off, there are many, many solution variants out there when -- between the antenna and the bit streams, so to speak. And there's -- we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from -- right from the antenna down into the bit stream area. So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially 4x the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last 5, 7 years. And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, the -- we have, again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of 8, 10 plus in terms of potential content just given the channel count on the radio transceivers which, by the way, is where most of the innovation has taken place in these 5G systems, at least, until they virtualize in the early '20s or so. So there's -- there are kind of 3 or 4 major building blocks in these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver, there's the massive MIMO addition, there's all this power technology that we can bring to bear now as well for our customers. And then there's the digital baseband, the digital front-end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side. And those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations. But in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined it with our converter technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So my sense is, over the next, say, 5 years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of 3x to 4x, and then it's a question of how many radios deploy. And -- but we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint."

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company.

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share. 
Looking at the full year now, revenues surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double-digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. 
This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduced our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders. As we outlined on the last call, going forward, we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases. 
Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI, also. So I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. 
Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best-of-both approach. Employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers. Our combined sales force has made really great strides in building and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market. 
During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside. All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, RF and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts. 
We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019, namely: immutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers' business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers, and we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. 
For example, in the wireless communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI's software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands of -- for spectral space, thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios contain an 8x increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI and the opportunity to capture, potentially, up to 4x the content when compared to current 4G solutions. 
I should note also that in addition, power management attached assignments in this area are just beginning but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter-wave-based future generations. Here, carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio and we're very well positioned to, once again, solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting-edge portfolio. So I believe we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space. 
So now turning for a moment to the industrial sector. Here, the digital factory envisioned by industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control, isolation and power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial-grade deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market.
In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future is equally bright here. We're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation, like A2B and C2B media transport technologies, and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector. 
On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever-increasing levels of precision in Level 3-plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles. 
In the electrification application area, we've made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the batteries' useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multigenerational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future. 
And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our health care business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past 5 years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers. For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago, we made a pivot to a domain-inspired approach to solve our customers' most difficult problems. 
We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits, for example. These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers' design challenges while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We've thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general, in the health care area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI. 
So in closing, I put forth a constructive scenario here today, and while some may be a bit skeptical given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that beset our world, our confidence, I believe, is very well-founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year and we've deepened our customer engagements. 
So we're in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace. And amidst an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create ever more innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately drives returns for our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We wrap up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. 
But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of the sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter led by strength in instrumentation, health care, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China. 
The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter, increased once again at the double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad-based, and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI. 
Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application. 
And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were a record at 43%. 
As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million. And with our full year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at about $0.55. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disti inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of 6 to 8 weeks. We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. 
During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt and paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2. As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly 260 million worth of shares. 
CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related cost for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor. 
We plan to provide a historical, quarterly end-market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning, you will see changes in our historical growth rates as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. 
Now on to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week, so we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison. 
First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint, on both the old and the new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard as well as a sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis and we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase low double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. 
Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lower sequentially due to the normal shutdowns around the holidays as well as business mix. We're expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially and does include some onetime items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. 
We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41% and we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07. 
Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business; that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion. 
So all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session."

The -- well, I think I've talked with quite a few customers, both domestically here in America and internationally over the last quarter, 1.5 quarters, maybe 2 quarters. In the atmosphere of the kind of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth and the impacts of the tariffs, I'd say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic though there is, obviously, concern which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand. So I would say, at this point in time, what we're seeing though is cancellations are at a kind of a normal rate and lead times, for the most part, are pretty normal. So in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say, in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China. And we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business. Obviously, health care has remained strong for the company. And I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or 2, so I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over the past -- really, the past decade. So I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been in that market. It is our #1 focus, I would say, and it's broad, it's deep, it's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond."

And I guess, are you at all concerned that some of this growth might be pull-ins from China trying to get these parts before the trade war escalates and potentially not being able to get these parts, just given how important massive MIMO and 5G are. Maybe you can help allay some of those concerns and just give us a little bit more detail there."

So let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated build-out of, I would say, enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So what I'm seeing is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and the -- I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands. When you look at the -- put the whole thing together, we're looking at '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last 3 years, I'd say. Hittite incidentally, just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here, when we inquired Hittite, it was roughly a $270 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time. And it isn't just communications, it's where microwave and those radio frequency technologies are used and aerospace and defense and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market. So I think, when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G, as some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we've got a 4x content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. So it's -- and that, by the way, doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LT in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think, the tailwinds are strong and ADI's content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger, so that's what we're seeing. I think it's a share gain story for ADI."

So I think the way to look at this, John, after this year's growth will be determined by essentially new sockets, either what we win or what we lose. That will determine, ultimately, what happens, I think, after '19.

And we're also now getting the benefit of adding LTC silent switcher technology into some of these sockets as well, so we're at the early stages of an operant in our power business there. I think as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solution technology. But I think we've really turned the corner, particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth and we expect '19, also, to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we're sampling our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity. On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of this in the prepared remarks across radar. We've got our -- we're sampling our 77-gigahertz image quality radar. We've a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LT and ADI mixed-signal technologies. And many customers are starting to use our IMU, inertial management units, in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving area. So I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get it back to a growth trajectory, and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous VD goals as well. So hopefully, Craig, that frames it up for you."

And I'd say, looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down and no big moves one way or another to report there. Industrial was up year-on-year. It was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again, a little quarter -- a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects there, SAR, China, this new testing modality that's being adopted in Europe, so -- but we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target. And communications across-the-board, all the primary geographies in which -- where strong communications are up very, very big on a year-on-year basis and also sequentially. So -- and that broad-based strength was led by China as well as the EU, particularly in the communications area. So -- but, hopefully, that gives you a sense for the atmosphere on the geographic basis. Prashanth, do you want to add anything?"

Certainly, we're headed into the holiday season, so our factory utilizations normally unaligned a bit for those that are impacted by Thanksgiving and then again for the Christmas-New Year period. So utilizations are coming down, but not necessarily linked to changes in the demand environment beyond our original planning areas. In terms of booking activities, certainly, our industrial business is seeing book-to-bill below parity and it's been a while since we've seen that. But as I mentioned, that we see most of that being heavily weighted from the 2 segments, factory automation and automated test equipment. Order activity has stabilized from where it was. Now I don't think we have the wherewithal to call the bottom here, but I'm just giving you the facts that we saw -- we certainly saw an improvement in October versus what we saw in September."

So I would say, for the most part, what we're seeing is really a pause rather than any -- we're not seeing cancellations as such. I think it's a pause. It's a level -- it's the macro uncertainty that's causing customers to be a little cautious. Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say -- as I've just said, cancellations are just normal. And just to give you a little more depth of color on that, so the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal 4- to 6-week window that we're planning to report. LTE is a little more mixed. We've had some, I would say, tightening of supply. Demand has been strong and supply has been a little tight, but we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity, in fact, over the last couple of quarters, to support not just today's shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So the book-to-bill as just -- as Prashanth said, just a little below parity on the B2B side, driven largely by industrial. So -- but I think the book-to-bill that we've given or that we're seeing is very supportive of the guidance that we put out there."

And how do you view the sustainability of the growth rate or even the target growth rate for your B2B segment?"

So I'd say -- I mean, it's very hard to parse out precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we, as a company, have -- we retooled the entire strategy of the company, 8, 9, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% for R&D in the B2B spaces and most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B areas. So the addition of the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well. We have been taking share, that I'm sure of, and I believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking. PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been strong. So obviously, the environment is strong, but I think ADI is executing in a more focused, more intense way as well in capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- I think a more moderated growth range. We've said that, for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business, kind of 2x to 3x GDP, we would be content on an ongoing basis. And that's my sense for '19 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that -- that's what we're going to see again in the -- we're going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year."

So I think, first off, there are many, many solution variants out there when -- between the antenna and the bit streams, so to speak. And there's -- we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from -- right from the antenna down into the bit stream area. So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially 4x the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last 5, 7 years. And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, the -- we have, again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of 8, 10 plus in terms of potential content just given the channel count on the radio transceivers which, by the way, is where most of the innovation has taken place in these 5G systems, at least, until they virtualize in the early '20s or so. So there's -- there are kind of 3 or 4 major building blocks in these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver, there's the massive MIMO addition, there's all this power technology that we can bring to bear now as well for our customers. And then there's the digital baseband, the digital front-end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side. And those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations. But in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined it with our converter technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So my sense is, over the next, say, 5 years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of 3x to 4x, and then it's a question of how many radios deploy. And -- but we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint."
