In Q3, Abiomed delivered best ever quarterly results on nearly every metric starting with $154 million in revenue, up 34%. Our robust growth set new records and was driven by U.S. patient utilization for both Protected PCI and emergent support, which increased 24% and 43%, respectively. In company history, our top 3 U.S. and Impella utilization months were all in Q3. We also achieved records in Europe aided by strength in the German -- in Germany, which grew 71% year-over-year. Our operational discipline and execution allowed us to achieve best-in-class gross margin of 84% and our best ever operating margin of 29%. 
We generated an additional $57 million in cash from operations, which brings our cash position to $351 million. We now own both manufacturing and training facilities in Massachusetts and Germany and maintain no debt as a company. With our solid balance sheet, we are investing in innovation, education and our patent portfolio. This quarter, we marked a new milestone of 300 patents awarded and an additional 272 patents pending. It is an exciting time as we collaborate with our customers to improve patient outcomes and the standard of care for circulatory support. As a result, the field of heart recovery is growing and ABIOMED is well positioned to capture the $5 billion U.S. market opportunity while planting the seeds for future growth in global markets. 
For today's call, I will highlight the clinical need and growing awareness of heart recovery with Impella support in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Starting with the U.S., both the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. Our Impella adoption increased to a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. We continue to have a long runway for growth because of our clinical benefits and FDA approvals. Our focus on training data and time combined with independent physician-led initiatives like shift and the national CSI continues to improve awareness and is having an impact on adoption. 
Last quarter, I spoke about a publication from The Advisory Board, an independent expert health care consulting company acquired by United Healthcare. This quarter, the advisory board circulated 2 additional publications referencing Impella. The first publications comes from the Cardiovascular Roundtable Annual Meeting, protected PCI, complex cardiac artery disease and cardiogenic shock were highlighted as advance programs that enable innovative hospitals to differentiate themselves and capturing new market opportunities. As a reference, Tabor and mitral valve are also on this list. 
The second publication stress the significant clinical need for the growing cardiogenic shock population. The report outlined the necessity for aligned patient care, recommended tactics for building a cardiogenic shock network and address the benefits, ranging from improved quality of care to alleviated cost burden. This timely publication piggybacks on success of this year's TCT physician call to arms, around improving outcomes in cardiogenic shock and this initiative is underway across United States. To be absolutely clear, cardiogenic shock is a major clinical problem with 50% mortality rates and it has a growing moderately aged population. We support 10% of this population today. 
What is critical to comprehend is that this is not only about survival. Native heart recovery is the goal. It is superior to just survival to the next therapy such as heart transplant and recovery improves patient quality of life and significantly lowers cost. The Advisory Board's recommendations aligned with our Abiomed mission to support hospitals in establishing Impella programs and protocols to improve patient outcomes. As a company, we are encouraged by the mounting intention and awareness for major influencers on the shock crisis. 
Moving to our Impella RP commercial launch. We opened 36 new RP sites for a total of 222 hospitals and also set a record for patient supported. For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we now have 15 hospital sites IRB approved that have randomized 26 patients to date, surpassing the halfway point of 50 patients. We are on track to complete the enrollment within our 18-month projection ending in October. 
Outside the U.S., we also made significant progress. In Germany, we set new patient records and have penetrated 12% of the annual 25,000 potential patients. In Japan, we have opened 9 of our projected 10 sites for the fiscal year ending in March and generated $1.1 million in revenue in Q3. We are prudently pacing our Japanese launch to ensure quality and optimal outcomes around heart recovery. I would like to share a story of one of the first patients treated in Tokyo at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. 
This 68-year-old patient had a history of coronary artery disease and called an ambulance after experiencing severe chest pain. Upon arrival to the hospital, he arrested and required CPR. One of his coronary arteries was 99% blocked and he was in profound cardiogenic shock with a lactate of 12, signifying severe lack of oxygen in the body. As a reference, one of the characteristics of cardiogenic shock is a lactate of greater than 2 and most people die when it is above 6. 
The physician inserted Impella 2.5 prior to the PCI in accordance with the clinical best practice of the national cardiogenic shock initiative protocol and the patient remained stable throughout the stenting procedure. After 3 days of Impella support, the patient's lactate normalized and he was successfully weaned off Impella. This patient returned home to his family with his native heart. This story elucidates the strong clinical demand for Impella in a country like Japan with cultural views that limit heart transplants and open heart surgeries. To date, 123 hospitals have initiated the Impella application process. 66 hospitals have submitted the application and 31 hospitals are currently approved. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide a brief update on the Impella 5.5 and the Impella ECP heart pumps. We remain on track for our first studies outside the U.S. in the first half of this calendar year and believe both products will further address the clinical needs of intervention cardiologists and heart surgeons. For those that missed our recent investor presentation at J.P. Morgan in January, we have posted our presentation on our website, including animations and new product introductions under the Investors section at abiomed.com. 
Turning to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance again to approximately $583 million, an increase of approximately 31% from the prior year. This compares to our prior fiscal 2018 guidance of $565 million to $575 million, an increase of 27% to 29%. These projects Q4 revenue to be approximately $164 million, up 31%. We are also again increasing our fiscal year 2018 guidance for operating margin to approximately 26% compared to the prior 23% to 25%. 
In summary, this quarter's execution enabled best results in revenue, operating margin, cash generation, patents and patient utilization in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a company, we are especially proud of our ability to work together with our hospitals to help improve patient outcomes. Abiomed continues to be one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies with increasing GAAP profitability. I want to recognize and thank the team for their dedication to our patients and customers. I also want to express our confidence in the future as we continue to build the field of heart recovery. 
I will now turn the call over to our former CFO and current Consultant, Bob Bowen."

Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 millio",873,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 million. U.S. Impella revenue rose 30% to $130.7 million, driven by a 33% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $17.3 million and was up 94%. Additionally, worldwide service revenue of $6 million was up 25%. In the U.S., at the end of the fiscal third quarter, the Impella 2.5 has been placed at 1,181 of approximately 1,400 targeted hospital sites for a penetration rate of 84%. Impella CP has been placed at 1,134 hospital sites for a penetration rate of 81%. Impella 5.0 has been placed at 498 sites for a penetration rate of 36% and Impella RP has been placed at 222 sites for a penetration rate of 16%. 
Reorder performance was strong for Q3 with U.S. reorders at $125 million and growing 31% versus the prior year and the reorder rate was approximately 100%. Average combined Impella 2.5 and Impella CP inventory at hospital sites, rose slightly to 3.75 units per site versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and versus 3.3 units per site in the prior year. Our busier sites carry more inventory as each pump must have a backup pump. In this way, higher patient volume at a given site requires higher levels of safety stock. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 83.8% compared to 83.4% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by higher production levels as the company manufactured the most pumps in its history. The favorable effects of higher production volume were partially offset by more console placements, the introduction of new manufacturing lines and the hiring of training of new operators to support growing demand. Because of investments in recent years, we have full manufacturing capability in both Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. We plan to continue to invest in the manufacturing area, particularly the adding of additional operators with related training initiatives and introduced new products and/or product features. 
R&D expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $17.7 million and increased 8% from the prior year. The bulk of R&D spending is related to investments and product enhancements and new products as well as research costs from our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, and ongoing cVAD Registry study. We expect to continue investing in product and clinical initiatives in the future. 
SG&A expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $66.6 million, an increase of $12.6 million or 23% from the prior year. We expect to continue expanding our industry-leading commercial team, and we expect to maintain a hiring pace of up to 10 additional U.S. field employees per quarter. We also expect to increase spending in Japan as we support the commercial launch in that country. 
Operating income for the third fiscal quarter grew 76% to $44.8 million or 29.1% of revenue, compared to $25.4 million or 22.2% of revenue in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was due to strong revenue growth and operational discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model. We will continue to invest in new products, product enhancements, new markets while prioritizing revenue growth and maintaining our operating discipline. We expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.4 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income before the recently enacted Tax Reform Act was $32.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $15.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the prior-year period. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income included income tax expense adjustments of approximately $18.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share due primarily to the recently enacted Tax Reform Act and excess tax benefit on employee share-based compensation awards, which were not applicable in the prior-year period. We believe the effects of the Tax Rate Reform Act will reduce our effective tax rate by 8 to 10 points beginning in fiscal 2019. This excludes the impact of excess tax benefits, which we believe will have a lesser effect in fiscal '19 than in fiscal '18. 
Also, keep in mind that we are not currently a cash income tax payer due to our deferred tax assets totaling $75 million. The balance sheet remains debt-free and we generated $57 million in cash from operating activities to end the quarter with $351 million in cash. During the quarter, we also closed on the purchase of our Danvers, Massachusetts global headquarters for $16.5 million. Our top priority for use of cash is to support our organic growth with product innovation, distribution, manufacturing and to continue to build our substantial advantage in intellectual property. Abiomed looks forward to continued execution during the fourth quarter. We have important tasks in front of us as we further penetrate Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock markets, rollout Impella in the Japanese market, launch Impella RP with the recent PMA approval and invest and product development and clinical studies. Abiomed will continue its pursuit of industry-leading innovation, growth and execution.

We will, overtime, continue to grow at a pace faster as we ramp, but we want to make sure that for the first 18 months of our launch, we get great outcomes. We've got rigorous training and compliance because we're also excited to bring the Impella CP and RP and other new products into Japan as soon as possible. And just to remind everyone, Japan is the second-largest medical device market for cultural reasons, they're not a astronomy or transplant environment and they're also -- unfortunately, for them, have a smoking population.

We are continuing to invest in Q4 in innovation and some of our clinical studies and product enhancements so we've guided to a 26% for the Q4, but as we've discussed with our 5-year vision, we are pursuing a $1 billion business with a 30% plus operating margin. And we are probably a little ahead of that 30% rate at this time, which we like, but we continue each year to incrementally move it up. But because of our razor, razor blade model, we believe we can be best-in-class operating margin, the way we are best-in-class gross margin and growth rates, and that's one of the goals for the company. Relative to your question on outside markets, we are only 12% penetrated in Germany of the 25,000 patients and we're very confident in that growth going into next year. And as we've mentioned, we will likely frustrate some investors in that our pace in Japan will be methodical, we'll be slow, but you really are entering a market that not only is it the second-largest market, it has the ability to be a heart recovery only clinical environment for us. So as we bring these new products into the country and then some new products around heart failure, we think we have 10-plus years of sustainable growth in Japan. So we really want to get it right with the government. MHLW and PMDA are in charge of all the indications, all the patients and all reimbursement. There's no such thing as an insurance company there, and that's why we want to establish our credibility with them up front. And again, continue to have patient stories like I mentioned where these patients in the past would usually have died or spent an amazing amount of time in the hospital reported they died organ at a time and to be able to send these patients home with their own heart in a shorter period of time. It's just a tremendous new clinical option that they haven't had in Japan. So we'll continue to execute and we'll continue to deliver best-in-class metrics."

And we said this in the past that we believe that the shock approval would take time to accelerate and would continue for the next 5 plus years, but there is a bit of a seesaw effect that happens between Protected PCI and shock and even our other buckets. So what we're focused on is sustainable growth so that we continue to have the right pace, but get the best outcomes, collect data and look for best practices. So I do think that the bigger question is the penetration rate. We are only at 9% blended so we have a long way to go, but we believe that the best way to continue to accelerate adoption is actually to have great outcomes and improve outcomes each year, which we've done. We will be giving more guidance on the next call for next year, but we certainly feel -- we're very pleased and we're very happy to see the effect of the physician call to arms on shock at TCT. And if you think about how poor outcomes are when you only 50% of the patients that go into shock at a hospital live, it's actually a coin toss. So we think we're going to have a major impact on improving outcomes.

So our targeted population of 100,000 means that of the 1,000 heart hospitals, they each have to do 100, which means that they do 8.3 a month, which means they do 2 a week. So 2 a week penetration of the 100,000 patients we're talking about is a $2.3 billion market.

The physician community, in some cases, their focus is just locally. They want to have better protocols at their own hospital, that's one of the reasons that you see a demand for the Impella RP. If you are going to treat profound shock patients, you likely need a right side device and again, that's at 222 sites. You have other hospitals that are working directly with the National CSI group, that's the Detroit initiative and they're submitting their data to that organization and that physician group. And then we have our own sites that are in our cVAD Registry, which is an FDA audited ongoing study and we're asking those sites also to switch to the NCSI protocol as well. We do think this -- in general, it's a 43% growth so that's very strong and we think it's being spread across the board and it's going to continue to drive adoption as more and more physicians get trained to feel comfortable putting the Impella in. And it's worth noting, this is the second quarter in a row and where the shock or the emergency patients exceeded the Protected PCI coordinator or Protected PCI patients, but we're also working with the coordinators to drive that volume as well.

The number that is probably the more adequate one to utilize is looking at how many drugs are used a year and there's well over 100,000 patients that receive multiple in order to improve their hemodynamics and have been shown to be a predictor of death as you escalate from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. And if you look at just the net effects or the net numbers on deaths in hospitals, well over 300,000 patients die of organ failure or heart failure in the hospital that again are relatively young, that could benefit from being stabilized with Impella both on the right and left.

And the thesis is by doing that, you'll precondition the th myocardium and you'll reduce the size of the infarct caused by reperfusion injury or the apoptosis process. If we can show that this is safe and the delay doesn't cause an issue for these patients, we can then move into the pivotal study where we'll be looking at showing what you're mentioning is reduction of infarct where you look at not only troponins and, we'll also have MRI follow-up images as well. But just so for all the people on the call, in today's growing epidemic of heart failure, we have amazing technology and innovation and from the plumbing side of stenting or pacemakers on the electricity, they've hit a limit of how they can improve survival. They've also had a result that the stats show that 70% of the people that have heart attacks will suffer from heart failure within 5 years. So clearly, we can do better with this population.

I felt like I came away from TCT, hearing similar anticipation around cardiogenic shock and the different initiative that we saw back when Chip was first implemented, whatever that was at TCT a few years back, right. There was a notable pickup amongst physicians and KOL on cardiogenic shock. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then following up on that, how we should think about the growth in cardiogenic shock versus high-risk PCI and how you balance that between -- amongst the sales force and sort of drive a balanced growth outlook between both? Sorry, that was a long question."

The call to arms by the physician community was very rewarding to -- for the company after the work we've done with education and training. And the community, the physician community has acknowledged that it's the outcomes for the mortality rate for the last 20 years in cardiogenic shock has been 50%. And the call to arms is that this population, we can do better than 50%. There is a lot of attention to the opioid crisis and there should be and there's a lot more we could do. Cardiogenic shock is also a crisis that is responsible for more deaths in the U.S. than the opioid crisis and again, these are 60 to 70 years old that have more life to live. So we are incredibly focused, not just on survival and I think this is where the momentum is starting to transition, but in native heart recovery because it's one thing to survive and it's another thing to survive and go home with your own heart and go home with -- in a shorter period of time. So that's the ultimate goal and that's where the momentum is starting to occur, the science in the understanding around what is native heart recovery. History also shows that in FDA approval, it's usually the strongest catalyst for market adoption, and this is the first fiscal year we've had full FDA exclusive approvals for high-risk PCI and shock as well as a dedicated DRG. So while we're one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies, changing the practice of medicine can be challenging, and that's why we always go back to our function of training data and time. On the last point of your question was around how do we balance high-risk PCI, again, our overall focus is on both high-risk PCI is a population that is out there, that we have to find them and get them referred into our best centers, that's why we're doing things like patient awareness campaigns, educations, the referring physicians, but in the end, we want to get great outcomes and we want to continue to grow at the right pace that is sustainable and collect our data and publish the share best practices."

And again, we scaled that number to be patients that will benefit today that are of a relatively appropriate age and have the ability to go home with their own heart. So we're really focused on that population. You can find numbers that are tremendously bigger. And again, when a person dies of heart failure in a hospital, they die of pump failure, they die of organ failure, so essentially if you make it to a hospital alive and that hospital has Impella, between the left side devices or the right side devices, we should be able to stabilize that patient for other therapies, but again we're focused on native heart recovery, and we are trying to get to 100% penetration, which means they will have drastic improvements in those growth rates."

And if you get better outcomes, it can be more margin for the hospital. It can be lower length of stay and what we do is we impact 2 of the 4 items that all hospitals are ranked on for quality so Protected PCI helps with their heart failure, helps reduce readmissions as shown on the FDA study. For shock, we tend -- we've shown the ability to have lower length of stay and again, native heart recovery. And so we're really helping hospitals improve their metrics that are being tracked by CMS. And with the new reform, hospitals shifted from measuring quality at discharged to quality at 90 days and that tends to be where you do best because we can significantly reduce those out of hospital adverse events with native heart recovery."

In Q3, Abiomed delivered best ever quarterly results on nearly every metric starting with $154 million in revenue, up 34%. Our robust growth set new records and was driven by U.S. patient utilization for both Protected PCI and emergent support, which increased 24% and 43%, respectively. In company history, our top 3 U.S. Impella utilization months were all in Q3. We also achieved records in Europe aided by strength in the German -- in Germany, which grew 71% year-over-year. Our operational discipline and execution allowed us to achieve best-in-class gross margin of 84% and our best ever operating margin of 29%. 
We generated an additional $57 million in cash from operations, which brings our cash position to $351 million. We now own both manufacturing and training facilities in Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and maintain no debt as a company. With our solid balance sheet, we are investing in innovation, education and our patent portfolio. This quarter, we marked a new milestone of 300 patents awarded and an additional 272 patents pending. It is an exciting time as we collaborate with our customers to improve patient outcomes and the standard of care for circulatory support. As a result, the field of heart recovery is growing and Abiomed is well positioned to capture the $5 billion U.S. market opportunity while planting the seeds for future growth in global markets. 
For today's call, I will highlight the clinical need and growing awareness of heart recovery with Impella support in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Starting with the U.S., both the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. Our Impella adoption increased to a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. We continue to have a long runway for growth because of our clinical benefits and FDA approvals. Our focus on training, data and time, combined with independent physician-led initiatives like CHIP and the National CSI, continues to improve awareness and is having an impact on adoption. 
Last quarter, I spoke about a publication from The Advisory Board, an independent expert health care consulting company acquired by UnitedHealthcare. This quarter, The Advisory Board circulated 2 additional publications referencing Impella. The first publications comes from the Cardiovascular Roundtable Annual Meeting, Protected PCI, complex coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock were highlighted as advanced programs that enable innovative hospitals to differentiate themselves and capture new market opportunities. As a reference, TAVR and mitral valve are also on this list. The second publication stressed the significant clinical need for the growing cardiogenic shock population. The report outlined the necessity for aligned patient care, recommended tactics for building a cardiogenic shock network and addressed the benefits, ranging from improved quality of care to alleviated cost burden. This timely publication piggybacks on success of this year's TCT physician call to arms around improving outcomes in cardiogenic shock and this initiative is underway across United States. To be absolutely clear, cardiogenic shock is a major clinical problem with 50% mortality rates and it has a growing moderately aged population. We support 10% of this population today. What is critical to comprehend is that this is not only about survival. Native heart recovery is the goal. It is superior to just survival to the next therapy, such as heart transplant, and recovery improves patient quality of life and significantly lowers costs. The Advisory Board's recommendations aligned with our Abiomed mission to support hospitals in establishing Impella programs and protocols to improve patient outcomes. As a company, we are encouraged by the mounting attention and awareness from major influencers on the shock crisis. 
Moving to our Impella RP commercial launch. We opened 36 new RP sites for a total of 222 hospitals and also set a record for patient supported. For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we now have 15 hospital sites IRB approved that have randomized 26 patients to date, surpassing the halfway point of 50 patients. We are on track to complete the enrollment within our 18-month projection ending in October. 
Outside the U.S., we also made significant progress. In Germany, we set new patient records and have penetrated 12% of the annual 25,000 potential patients. In Japan, we have opened 9 of our projected 10 sites for the fiscal year ending in March and generated $1.1 million in revenue in Q3. We are prudently pacing our Japanese launch to ensure quality and optimal outcomes around heart recovery. 
I would like to share a story of one of the first patients treated in Tokyo at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. This 68-year-old patient had a history of coronary artery disease and called an ambulance after experiencing severe chest pain. Upon arrival to the hospital, he arrested and required CPR. One of his coronary arteries was 99% blocked, and he was in profound cardiogenic shock with a lactate of 12, signifying severe lack of oxygen in the body. As a reference, one of the characteristics of cardiogenic shock is a lactate of greater than 2 and most people die when it is above 6. The physician inserted Impella 2.5 prior to the PCI in accordance with the clinical best practice of the National Cardiogenic Shock initiative protocol and the patient remained stable throughout the stenting procedure. After 3 days of Impella support, the patient's lactate normalized and he was successfully weaned off Impella. This patient returned home to his family with his native heart. This story elucidates the strong clinical demand for Impella in a country like Japan with cultural views that limit heart transplants and open-heart surgeries. To date, 123 hospitals have initiated the Impella application process. 66 hospitals have submitted the application and 31 hospitals are currently approved. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide a brief update on the Impella 5.5 and the Impella ECP heart pumps. We remain on track for our first-in-man studies outside the U.S. in the first half of this calendar year and believe both products will further address the clinical needs of intervention cardiologists and heart surgeons. For those that missed our recent Investor Presentation at J.P. Morgan in January, we have posted our presentation on our website, including animations and new product introductions under the Investors section at abiomed.com. 
Turning to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance again to approximately $583 million, an increase of approximately 31% from the prior year. This compares to our prior fiscal 2018 guidance of $565 million to $575 million, an increase of 27% to 29%. This projects Q4 revenue to be approximately $164 million, up 31%. We are also again increasing our fiscal year 2018 guidance for operating margin to approximately 26% compared to the prior 23% to 25%. 
In summary, this quarter's execution enabled the best results in revenue, operating margin, cash generation, patents and patient utilization in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a company, we are especially proud of our ability to work together with our hospitals to help improve patient outcomes. Abiomed continues to be one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies with increasing GAAP profitability. I want to recognize and thank the team for their dedication to our patients and customers. I also want to express our confidence in the future as we continue to build the field of heart recovery. 
I will now turn the call over to our former CFO and current Consultant, Bob Bowen."

Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 mill",875,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. 
Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 million. U.S. Impella revenue rose 30% to $130.7 million, driven by a 33% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $17.3 million and was up 94%. Additionally, worldwide service revenue of $6 million was up 25%. In the U.S., at the end of the fiscal third quarter, the Impella 2.5 has been placed at 1,181 of approximately 1,400 targeted hospital sites for a penetration rate of 84%. Impella CP has been placed at 1,134 hospital sites for a penetration rate of 81%. Impella 5.0 has been placed at 498 sites for a penetration rate of 36% and Impella RP has been placed at 222 sites for a penetration rate of 16%. 
Reorder performance was strong for Q3 with U.S. reorders at $125 million and growing 31% versus the prior year and the reorder rate was approximately 100%. Average combined Impella 2.5 and Impella CP inventory at hospital sites rose slightly to 3.75 units per site versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and versus 3.3 units per site in the prior year. Our busier sites carry more inventory as each pump must have a backup pump. In this way, higher patient volume at a given site requires higher levels of safety stock. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 83.8% compared to 83.4% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by higher production levels as the company manufactured the most pumps in its history. The favorable effects of higher production volume were partially offset by more console placements, the introduction of new manufacturing lines and the hiring of training of new operators to support growing demand. Because of investments in recent years, we have full manufacturing capability in both Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. We plan to continue to invest in the manufacturing area, particularly the adding of additional operators with related training initiatives and introduce new products and/or product features. 
R&D expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $17.7 million and increased 8% from the prior year. The bulk of R&D spending is related to investments in product enhancements and new products as well as research costs from our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study and ongoing cVAD Registry study. We expect to continue investing in product and clinical initiatives in the future. 
SG&A expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $66.6 million, an increase of $12.6 million or 23% from the prior year. We expect to continue expanding our industry-leading commercial team, and we expect to maintain a hiring pace of up to 10 additional U.S. field employees per quarter. We also expect to increase spending in Japan as we support the commercial launch in that country. 
Operating income for the third fiscal quarter grew 76% to $44.8 million or 29.1% of revenue compared to $25.4 million or 22.2% of revenue in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was due to strong revenue growth and operational discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model. We will continue to invest in new products, product enhancements, new markets while prioritizing revenue growth and maintaining our operating discipline. We expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 26%. 
GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.4 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income before the recently enacted Tax Reform Act was $32.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $15.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the prior year period. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income included income tax expense adjustments of approximately $18.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share due primarily to the recently enacted Tax Reform Act and excess tax benefits on employee share-based compensation awards, which were not applicable in the prior year period. We believe the effects of the Tax Reform Act will reduce our effective tax rate by 8 to 10 points beginning in fiscal 2019. This excludes the impact of excess tax benefits, which we believe will have a lesser effect in fiscal '19 than in fiscal '18. 
Also, keep in mind that we are not currently a cash income tax payer due to our deferred tax assets totaling $75 million. The balance sheet remains debt-free and we generated $57 million in cash from operating activities to end the quarter with $351 million in cash. 
During the quarter, we also closed on the purchase of our Danvers, Massachusetts global headquarters for $16.5 million. Our top priority for use of cash is to support our organic growth with product innovation, distribution, manufacturing and to continue to build our substantial advantage in intellectual property. Abiomed looks forward to continued execution during the fourth quarter. We have important tasks in front of us as we further penetrate Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock markets, roll out Impella in the Japanese market, launch Impella RP with the recent PMA approval and invest in product development and clinical studies. Abiomed will continue its pursuit of industry-leading innovation, growth and execution.

Our goal for the year was that we would open 10 centers by the end of March. So we're ahead of schedule right now with 9 of the 10 opened. Of the $1.1 million in revenue, much of this is initial placement revenue, but we do anticipate some more incremental revenue in Q4. We will, over time, continue to go at a pace faster as we ramp. But we want to make sure that for the first 18 months of our launch, we get great outcomes, we've got rigorous training and compliance because we're also excited to bring the Impella CP and RP and other new products into Japan as soon as possible. And just to remind everyone, Japan is the second-largest medical device market. For cultural reasons, they're not a sternotomy or transplant environment and they also -- unfortunately, for them, they have a smoking population. So we think we can have a major impact in bringing heart recovery to the country. And we currently have 31 employees in Japan, and we're continuing to ramp up with the patients."

We are continuing to invest in Q4 in innovation in some of our clinical studies and product enhancements, so we've guided to a 26% for the Q4. But as we've discussed with our 5-year vision, we are pursuing a $1 billion business with a 30%-plus operating margin. And we are probably a little ahead of that 30% rate at this time, which we like, but we continue each year to incrementally move it up. But because of our razor-razorblade model, we believe that we can be best-in-class operating margin, the way we are best-in-class gross margin and growth rates. And that's one of the goals for the company. Relative to your question on outside markets, we are only 12% penetrated in Germany of the 25,000 patients and we're very confident in that growth going into next year. And as we've mentioned, we will likely frustrate some investors in that our pace in Japan will be methodical, will be slow, but you really are entering a market that not only is it the second-largest market, it has the ability to be a heart-recovery-only clinical environment for us. So as we bring these new products into the country and then some new products around heart failure, we think we have 10-plus years of sustainable growth in Japan. So we really want to get it right with the government. MHLW and PMDA are in charge of all the indications, all the patients and all reimbursement. There's no such thing as an insurance company there, and that's why we want to establish our credibility with them up front and again, continue to have patient stories like I mentioned where these patients in the past would usually have died or spent an amazing amount of time in the hospital before they died organ at a time and to be able to send these patients home with their own heart in a shorter period of time. It's just a tremendous new clinical option that they haven't had in Japan. So we'll continue to execute and we'll continue to deliver best-in-class metrics."

And we said this in the past that we believe that the shock approval would take time to accelerate and would continue for the next 5-plus years, but there is a bit of a seesaw effect that happens between Protected PCI and shock and even our other buckets. So what we're focused on is sustainable growth so that we continue to have the right pace but get the best outcomes, collect data and look for best practices. So I do think that the bigger question is the penetration rate. We are only at 9% blended so we have a long way to go, but we believe that the best way to continue to accelerate adoption is actually to have great outcomes and improve outcomes each year, which we've done. We will be giving more guidance on the next call for next year, but we certainly feel -- we're very pleased and we're very happy to see the effect of the physician call to arms on shock at TCT. And if you think about how poor outcomes are when you -- only 50% of the patients that go into shock at a hospital live, it's essentially a coin toss. So we think we're going to have a major impact on improving outcomes.

Over a couple of hundred thousand patients here die in hospitals of shock or, overall, heart failure. So our targeted population of 100,000 means that of the 1,000 heart hospitals, they each have to do 100, which means that they do 8.3 a month, which means they do 2 a week.

The physician community, in some cases, their focus is just locally. They want to have better protocols at their own hospital, that's one of the reasons that you see a demand for the Impella RP. If you are going to treat profound shock patients, you likely need a right side device and again, that's at 222 sites. You have other hospitals that are working directly with the National CSI group, that's the Detroit initiative and they're submitting their data to that organization and that physician group. And then we have our own sites that are in our cVAD Registry, which is an FDA-audited ongoing study, and we're asking those sites also to switch to the NCSI protocol as well. We do think -- this, in general, is a 43% growth so that's very strong. And we think it's being spread across the board and it's going to continue to drive adoption as more and more physicians get trained and feel comfortable putting the Impella in. And it's worth noting, this is the second quarter in a row and where the shock or the emergency patients exceeded the Protected PCI coordinator or the Protected PCI patients, but we're also working with coordinators to drive that volume as well.

On the reports that you can look at that are samples or that are pulled from CMS, they don't always report all the deaths relatives -- or accurately or even when someone has had support. But you're 100% correct, about 1/3 of these sites or 1/3 of these patients are getting any support with the intra-aortic balloon pump, so there's tremendous upside there. The number that is probably the more adequate one to utilize is looking at how many inotropic drugs are used a year. And there's well over 100,000 patients that receive multiple inotropes in order to improve their hemodynamics. And inotropes have been shown to be a predictor of death as you escalate from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. And if you look at just the net effects or the net numbers on deaths in hospitals, well over 300,000 patients die of organ failure or heart failure in the hospital that, again, are relatively young that could benefit from being stabilized with Impella, both on the right and left.

And if we can show that this is safe and the delay doesn't cause an issue for these patients, we can then move into the pivotal study where we'll be looking at showing what you're mentioning is reduction of infarct where you look at not only troponin and CKMB, we'll also have MRI follow-up images as well. But just so for all the people on the call, in today's growing epidemic of heart failure, we have amazing technology and innovation and from the plumbing side of stenting or pacemakers on the electricity, they've hit a limit of how they can improve survival. They've also had a result that the stat show that 70% of the people that have heart attacks will suffer from heart failure within 5 years. So clearly, we can do better with this population.

How much momentum -- I know this is -- I'm asking you to put numbers around what is more qualitative, maybe even to talk about it qualitatively, momentum post-TCT. I felt like I came away from TCT hearing similar anticipation around cardiogenic shock and the different initiative that we saw back when CHIP was first implemented, whenever that was at TCT a few years back, right? There was a notable pickup amongst physicians and KOLs on cardiogenic shock. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then following up on that, how we should think about the growth in cardiogenic shock versus high-risk PCI? And how you balance that between -- amongst the sales force and sort of drive a balanced growth outlook between both? Sorry, that was a long question."

The call to arms by the physician community was very rewarding to -- for the company after the work we've done with education and training. And the community, the physician community has acknowledged that it's -- the outcomes for the mortality rate for the last 20 years in cardiogenic shock has been 50%. And the call to arms is that this population, we can do better than 50%. There is a lot of attention to the opioid crisis and there should be and there's a lot more we can do. Cardiogenic shock is also a crisis that is responsible for more deaths in the U.S. than the opioid crisis. And again, these are 60 to 70 years old that have more life to live. So we are incredibly focused not just on survival, and I think this is where the momentum is starting to transition, but in native heart recovery because it's one thing to survive and it's another thing to survive and go home with your own heart and go home within a shorter period of time. So that's the ultimate goal and that's where the momentum is starting to occur, the science and the understanding around what is native heart recovery. History also shows that in FDA approval, it's usually the strongest catalyst for market adoption. And this is the first fiscal year we've had full FDA exclusive approvals for high-risk PCI and shock as well as a dedicated DRG. So while we're one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies, changing the practice of medicine can be challenging, and that's why we always go back to our function of training, data and time. And the last point of your question was around how do we balance high-risk PCI. Again, our overall focus is on both high-risk PCI is a population that is out there, that we have to find them and get them referred into our best centers that's why we're doing things like patient awareness campaigns, education, the referring physicians. But in the end, we want to get great outcomes and we want to continue to grow at the right pace that is sustainable and collect our data and publish and share best practices."

We likely do not need to be at most hospitals for Protected PCI. And in many cases, we will swing into the hospital into the ICU because we think we can help standardize protocols, but we also have a 24/7 call center with nurse experts.

And again, we scale that number to be patients that will benefit today that are of a relatively appropriate age and have the ability to go home with their own heart. So we're really focused on that population. You can find numbers that are tremendously bigger. And again, when a person dies of heart failure in a hospital that they die of pump failure, they die of organ failure.

And the way the system is set up is that an efficient hospital, the majority of the time, can breakeven or make a little money. But again, it comes back to the outcomes. And if you get better outcomes, there can be more margin for the hospital, that can be a lower length of stay. And what we do is we impact 2 of the 4 items that all hospitals are ranked on for quality. So Protected PCI helps with their heart failure, helps reduce readmissions as shown in the FDA study. For shock, we tend to -- we've shown the ability to have lower length of stay and, again, native heart recovery. And so we're really helping hospitals improve their metrics that are being tracked by CMS. And with the new reform, hospitals shifted from measuring quality at discharge to quality at 90 days.

In Q3, Abiomed delivered best ever quarterly results on nearly every metric starting with $154 million in revenue, up 34%. Our robust growth set new records and was driven by U.S. patient utilization for both Protected PCI and emergent support, which increased 24% and 43%, respectively. In company history, our top 3 U.S. Impella utilization months were all in Q3. We also achieved records in Europe aided by strength in the German -- in Germany, which grew 71% year-over-year. Our operational discipline and execution allowed us to achieve best-in-class gross margin of 84% and our best ever operating margin of 29%.
We generated an additional $57 million in cash from operations, which brings our cash position to $351 million. We now own both manufacturing and training facilities in Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and maintain no debt as a company. With our solid balance sheet, we are investing in innovation, education and our patent portfolio. This quarter, we marked a new milestone of 300 patents awarded and an additional 272 patents pending. It is an exciting time as we collaborate with our customers to improve patient outcomes and the standard of care for circulatory support. As a result, the field of heart recovery is growing, and Abiomed is well positioned to capture the $5 billion U.S. market opportunity while planting the seeds for future growth in global markets.
For today's call, I will highlight the clinical need and growing awareness of heart recovery with Impella support in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Starting with the U.S., both the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. Our Impella adoption increased to a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. We continue to have a long runway for growth because of our clinical benefits and FDA approvals. Our focus on training, data and time, combined with independent physician-led initiatives like CHIP and the National CSI, continues to improve awareness and is having an impact on adoption.
Last quarter, I spoke about a publication from The Advisory Board, an independent expert health care consulting company acquired by UnitedHealthcare. This quarter, The Advisory Board circulated 2 additional publications referencing Impella. The first publications comes from the Cardiovascular Roundtable Annual Meeting, Protected PCI, complex coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock were highlighted as advanced programs that enable innovative hospitals to differentiate themselves and capture new market opportunities. As a reference, TAVR and mitral valve are also on this list. The second publication stressed the significant clinical need for the growing cardiogenic shock population. The report outlined the necessity for aligned patient care, recommended tactics for building a cardiogenic shock network and addressed the benefits, ranging from improved quality of care to alleviated cost burden. This timely publication piggybacks on success of this year's TCT physician call to arms around improving outcomes in cardiogenic shock, and this initiative is under way across United States. To be absolutely clear, cardiogenic shock is a major clinical problem with 50% mortality rates, and it has a growing moderately aged population. We support 10% of this population today. What is critical to comprehend is that this is not only about survival. Native heart recovery is the goal. It is superior to just survival to the next therapy, such as heart transplant, and recovery improves patient quality of life and significantly lowers costs. The Advisory Board's recommendations aligned with our Abiomed mission to support hospitals in establishing Impella programs and protocols to improve patient outcomes. As a company, we are encouraged by the mounting attention and awareness from major influencers on the shock crisis.
Moving to our Impella RP commercial launch. We opened 36 new RP sites for a total of 222 hospitals and also set a record for patients supported. For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we now have 15 hospital sites IRB approved that have randomized 26 patients to date, surpassing the halfway point of 50 patients. We are on track to complete the enrollment within our 18-month projection ending in October.
Outside the U.S., we also made significant progress. In Germany, we set new patient records and have penetrated 12% of the annual 25,000 potential patients. In Japan, we have opened 9 of our projected 10 sites for the fiscal year ending in March and generated $1.1 million in revenue in Q3. We are prudently pacing our Japanese launch to ensure quality and optimal outcomes around heart recovery.
I would like to share a story of one of the first patients treated in Tokyo at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. This 68-year-old patient had a history of coronary artery disease and called an ambulance after experiencing severe chest pain. Upon arrival to the hospital, he arrested and required CPR. One of his coronary arteries was 99% blocked, and he was in profound cardiogenic shock with a lactate of 12, signifying severe lack of oxygen in the body. As a reference, one of the characteristics of cardiogenic shock is a lactate of greater than 2 and most people die when it is above 6. The physician inserted Impella 2.5 prior to the PCI in accordance with the clinical best practice of the National Cardiogenic Shock initiative protocol, and the patient remained stable throughout the stenting procedure. After 3 days of Impella support, the patient's lactate normalized and he was successfully weaned off Impella. This patient returned home to his family with his native heart. This story elucidates the strong clinical demand for Impella in a country like Japan with cultural views that limit heart transplants and open-heart surgeries. To date, 123 hospitals have initiated the Impella application process. 66 hospitals have submitted the application, and 31 hospitals are currently approved.
Before concluding, I would like to provide a brief update on the Impella 5.5 and the Impella ECP heart pumps. We remain on track for our first-in-man studies outside the U.S. in the first half of this calendar year and believe both products will further address the clinical needs of interventional cardiologists and heart surgeons. For those that missed our recent Investor Presentation at J.P. Morgan in January, we have posted our presentation on our website, including animations and new product introductions under the Investors section at abiomed.com.
Turning to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance again to approximately $583 million, an increase of approximately 31% from the prior year. This compares to our prior fiscal 2018 guidance of $565 million to $575 million, an increase of 27% to 29%. This projects Q4 revenue to be approximately $164 million, up 31%. We are also again increasing our fiscal year 2018 guidance for operating margin to approximately 26% compared to the prior 23% to 25%.
In summary, this quarter's execution enabled the best results in revenue, operating margin, cash generation, patents and patient utilization in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a company, we are especially proud of our ability to work together with our hospitals to help improve patient outcomes. Abiomed continues to be one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies with increasing GAAP profitability. I want to recognize and thank the team for their dedication to our patients and customers. I also want to express our confidence in the future as we continue to build the field of heart recovery.
I will now turn the call over to our former CFO and current Consultant, Bob Bowen."

Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 million. U.S. Impella revenue rose 30% to $130.7 million, driven by a 33% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $17.3 million and was up 94%. Additionally, worldwide service revenue of $6 million was up 25%. In the U.S., at the end of the fiscal third quarter, the Impella 2.5 has been placed at 1,181 of approximately 1,400 targeted hospital sites for a penetration rate of 84%. Impella CP has been placed at 1,134 hospital sites for a penetration rate of 81%. Impella 5.0 has been placed at 498 sites for a penetration rate of 36% and Impella RP has been placed at 222 sites for a penetration rate of 16%.
Reorder performance was strong for Q3 with U.S. reorders at $125 million and growing 31% versus the prior year and the reorder rate was approximately 100%. Average combined Impella 2.5 and Impella CP inventory at hospital sites rose slightly to 3.75 units per site versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and versus 3.3 units per site in the prior year. Our busier sites carry more inventory as each pump must have a backup pump. In this way, higher patient volume at a given site requires higher levels of safety stock.
Gross margin for the quarter was 83.8% compared to 83.4% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by higher production levels as the company manufactured the most pumps in its history. The favorable effects of higher production volume were partially offset by more console placements, the introduction of new manufacturing lines and the hiring of training of new operators to support growing demand. Because of investments in recent years, we have full manufacturing capability in both Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. We plan to continue to invest in the manufacturing area, particularly the adding of additional operators with related training initiatives and introduce new products and/or product features.
R&D expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $17.7 million and increased 8% from the prior year. The bulk of R&D spending is related to investments in product enhancements and new products as well as research costs from our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study and ongoing cVAD Registry study. We expect to continue investing in product and clinical initiatives in the future.
SG&A expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $66.6 million, an increase of $12.6 million or 23% from the prior year. We expect to continue expanding our industry-leading commercial team, and we expect to maintain a hiring pace of up to 10 additional U.S. field employees per quarter. We also expect to increase spending in Japan as we support the commercial launch in that country.
Operating income for the third fiscal quarter grew 76% to $44.8 million or 29.1% of revenue compared to $25.4 million or 22.2% of revenue in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was due to strong revenue growth and operational discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model. We will continue to invest in new products, product enhancements, new markets while prioritizing revenue growth and maintaining our operating discipline. We expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 26%.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.4 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income before the recently enacted Tax Reform Act was $32.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $15.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the prior year period. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income included income tax expense adjustments of approximately $18.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share due primarily to the recently enacted Tax Reform Act and excess tax benefits on employee share-based compensation awards, which were not applicable in the prior year period. We believe the effects of the Tax Reform Act will reduce our effective tax rate by 8 to 10 points beginning in fiscal 2019. This excludes the impact of excess tax benefits, which we believe will have a lesser effect in fiscal '19 than in fiscal '18.
Also, keep in mind that we are not currently a cash income taxpayer due to our deferred tax assets totaling $75 million. The balance sheet remains debt-free, and we generated $57 million in cash from operating activities to end the quarter with $351 million in cash.
During the quarter, we also closed on the purchase of our Danvers, Massachusetts global headquarters for $16.5 million. Our top priority for use of cash is to support our organic growth with product innovation, distribution, manufacturing and to continue to build our substantial advantage in intellectual property. Abiomed looks forward to continued execution during the fourth quarter. We have important tasks in front of us as we further penetrate Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock markets, roll out Impella in the Japanese market, launch Impella RP with the recent PMA approval and invest in product development and clinical studies. Abiomed will continue its pursuit of industry-leading innovation, growth and execution.

Our goal for the year was that we would open 10 centers by the end of March. So we're ahead of schedule right now with 9 of the 10 opened. Of the $1.1 million in revenue, much of this is initial placement revenue, but we do anticipate some more incremental revenue in Q4. We will, over time, continue to go at a pace faster as we ramp. But we want to make sure that for the first 18 months of our launch, we get great outcomes, we've got rigorous training and compliance because we're also excited to bring the Impella CP and RP and other new products into Japan as soon as possible. And just to remind everyone, Japan is the second-largest medical device market. For cultural reasons, they're not a sternotomy or transplant environment and they also -- unfortunately, for them, they have a smoking population. So we think we can have a major impact in bringing heart recovery to the country. And we currently have 31 employees in Japan, and we're continuing to ramp with the patients."

We are continuing to invest in Q4 in innovation in some of our clinical studies and product enhancements, so we've guided to a 26% for the Q4. But as we've discussed with our 5-year vision, we are pursuing a $1 billion business with a 30%-plus operating margin. And we are probably a little ahead of that 30% rate at this time, which we like, but we continue each year to incrementally move it up. But because of our razor, razorblade model, we believe that we can be best-in-class operating margin, the way we are best-in-class gross margin and growth rates. And that's one of the goals for the company. Relative to your question on outside markets, we are only 12% penetrated in Germany of the 25,000 patients, and we're very confident in that growth going into next year. And as we've mentioned, we will likely frustrate some investors in that our pace in Japan will be methodical, will be slow, but you really are entering a market that not only is it the second-largest market, it has the ability to be a heart-recovery-only clinical environment for us. So as we bring these new products into the country and then some new products around heart failure, we think we have 10-plus years of sustainable growth in Japan. So we really want to get it right with the government. MHLW and PMDA are in charge of all the indications, all the patients and all reimbursement. There's no such thing as an insurance company there, and that's why we want to establish our credibility with them up front and, again, continue to have patient stories like I mentioned where these patients in the past would usually have died or spent an amazing amount of time in the hospital before they died organ at a time, and to be able to send these patients home with their own heart in a shorter period of time is just a tremendous new clinical option that they haven't had in Japan. So we'll continue to execute and we'll continue to deliver best-in-class metrics."

And we said this in the past that we believe that the shock approval would take time to accelerate and would continue for the next 5-plus years, but there is a bit of a seesaw effect that happens between Protected PCI and shock and even our other buckets. So what we're focused on is sustainable growth so that we continue to have the right pace but get the best outcomes, collect data and look for best practices. So I do think that the bigger question is the penetration rate. We are only at 9% blended, so we have a long way to go, but we believe that the best way to continue to accelerate adoption is actually to have great outcomes and improve outcomes each year, which we've done. We will be giving more guidance on the next call for next year, but we certainly feel -- we're very pleased and we're very happy to see the effect of the physician call to arms on shock at TCT. And if you think about how poor outcomes are when you -- only 50% of the patients that go into shock at a hospital live, it's essentially a coin toss. So we think we're going to have a major impact on improving outcomes. And again, these are relatively young patients, anywhere from 60 to 70 years old, and they have a lot of life left to live with their own heart."

So we really have to get these great outcomes and it definitely has that potential to continue to ramp, and that's why we're so focused on collecting the data and sharing best practices."

The physician community, in some cases, their focus is just locally. They want to have better protocols at their own hospital, that's one of the reasons that you see a demand for the Impella RP. If you are going to treat profound shock patients, you likely need a right side device and again, that's at 222 sites. You have other hospitals that are working directly with the National CSI group, that's the Detroit initiative and they're submitting their data to that organization and that physician group. And then we have our own sites that are in our cVAD Registry, which is an FDA-audited ongoing study, and we're asking those sites also to switch to the NCSI protocol as well. We do think -- this, in general, is a 43% growth, so that's very strong. And we think it's being spread across the board and it's going to continue to drive adoption as more and more physicians get trained and feel comfortable putting the Impella in. And it's worth noting, this is the second quarter in a row and where the shock or the emergency patients exceeded the Protected PCI coordinator or the Protected PCI patients, but we're also working with coordinators to drive that volume as well. So it really comes back to just getting great outcomes, understanding these are different types of patients. Our Protected PCI patients are like the TAVR market and our emergency patients are out there in all these different hospitals, and we want to be able to capture them as soon as we can."

On the reports that you can look at that are sampled or that are pulled from CMS, they don't always report all the deaths relatives -- or accurately or even when someone has had support. But you're 100% correct, about 1/3 of these sites or 1/3 of these patients are getting any support with the intra-aortic balloon pump, so there's tremendous upside there. The number that is probably the more adequate one to utilize is looking at how many inotropic drugs are used a year. And there's well over 100,000 patients that receive multiple inotropes in order to improve their hemodynamics. And inotropes have been shown to be a predictor of death as you escalate from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. And if you look at just the net effects or the net numbers on deaths in hospitals, well over 300,000 patients die of organ failure or heart failure in the hospital that, again, are relatively young that could benefit from being stabilized with Impella, both on the right and left. So we do believe that 100,000 is the appropriate proper number from a bigger funnel just like we believe the 121 is a conservative and proper number to be treated today for high-risk PCI."

They're not at that level yet. And we're really also testing the concept that you can delay opening up the coronary blockage by unloading the Impella -- with 30 minutes of Impella unloading. And the thesis is by doing that, you'll precondition the myocardium and you'll reduce the size of the infarct caused by reperfusion injury or the apoptosis process. And if we can show that this is safe and the delay doesn't cause an issue for these patients, we can then move into the pivotal study where we'll be looking at showing what you're mentioning is reduction of infarct where you'll look at not only troponin and CKMB, we'll also have MRI follow-up images as well. But just so for all the people on the call, in today's growing epidemic of heart failure, we have amazing technology and innovation, and from the plumbing side of stenting or pacemakers on the electricity, they've hit a limit of how they can improve survival. They've also had a result that the stats show that 70% of the people that have heart attacks will suffer from heart failure within 5 years. So clearly, we can do better with this population. And as you mentioned, if we can show this here in this population, there'll be new patients, but I think it also adds more credibility and benefit for all our other applications."

How much momentum -- I know this is -- I'm asking you to put numbers around what is more qualitative, maybe even to talk about it qualitatively, momentum post-TCT. I felt like I came away from TCT hearing similar anticipation around cardiogenic shock and the different initiative that we saw back when CHIP was first implemented, whenever that was at TCT a few years back, right? There was a notable pickup amongst physicians and KOLs on cardiogenic shock. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then following up on that, how we should think about the growth in cardiogenic shock versus high-risk PCI.

The call to arms by the physician community was very rewarding to -- for the company after the work we've done with education and training. And the community, the physician community has acknowledged that it's -- the outcomes for the mortality rate for the last 20 years in cardiogenic shock has been 50%. And the call to arms is that this population, we can do better than 50%. There is a lot of attention to the opioid crisis, and there should be. And there's a lot more we can do. Cardiogenic shock is also a crisis that is responsible for more deaths in the U.S. than the opioid crisis. And again, these are 60 to 70 years old that have more life to live. So we are incredibly focused not just on survival, and I think this is where the momentum is starting to transition, but in native heart recovery because it's one thing to survive and it's another thing to survive and go home with your own heart and go home within a shorter period of time. So that's the ultimate goal and that's where the momentum is starting to occur, the science and the understanding around what is native heart recovery. History also shows that in FDA approval, it's usually the strongest catalyst for market adoption. And this is the first fiscal year we've had full FDA exclusive approvals for high-risk PCI and shock as well as a dedicated DRG. So while we're one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies, changing the practice of medicine can be challenging, and that's why we always go back to our function of training, data and time. And the last point of your question was around how do we balance high-risk PCI. Again, our overall focus is on both high-risk PCI is a population that is out there, that we have to find them and get them referred into our best centers that's why we're doing things like patient awareness campaigns, education, the referring physicians. But in the end, we want to get great outcomes and we want to continue to grow at the right pace that is sustainable and collect our data and publish and share best practices."

And again, we scale that number to be patients that will benefit today that are of a relatively appropriate age and have the ability to go home with their own heart. So we're really focused on that population. You can find numbers that are tremendously bigger. And again, when a person dies of heart failure in a hospital that they die of pump failure, they die of organ failure. So essentially, if you make it to a hospital alive and that hospital has Impella, between the left side devices and the right side devices, we should be able to stabilize that patient to allow for other therapies. But again, we're focused on native heart recovery, and we are trying to get to 100% penetration, which means that we'll have drastic improvements in those growth rates."

And the way the system is set up is that an efficient hospital, the majority of the time, can break even or make a little money. But again, it comes back to the outcomes. And if you get better outcomes, there can be more margin for the hospital, that can be a lower length of stay. And what we do is we impact 2 of the 4 items that all hospitals are ranked on for quality. So Protected PCI helps with their heart failure, helps reduce readmissions as shown in the FDA study. For shock, we tend to -- we've shown the ability to have lower length of stay and, again, native heart recovery. And so we're really helping hospitals improve their metrics that are being tracked by CMS. And with the new reform, hospitals shifted from measuring quality at discharge to quality at 90 days. And that tends to be where you do best because we can significantly reduce those out of hospital, adverse events with native heart recovery."

In Q3, Abiomed delivered best ever quarterly results on nearly every metric starting with $154 million in revenue, up 34%. Our robust growth set new records and was driven by U.S. patient utilization for both Protected PCI and emergent support, which increased 24% and 43%, respectively. In company history, our top 3 U.S. Impella utilization months were all in Q3. We also achieved records in Europe aided by strength in the German -- in Germany, which grew 71% year-over-year. Our operational discipline and execution allowed us to achieve best-in-class gross margin of 84% and our best ever operating margin of 29%.
We generated an additional $57 million in cash from operations, which brings our cash position to $351 million. We now own both manufacturing and training facilities in Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and maintain no debt as a company. With our solid balance sheet, we are investing in innovation, education and our patent portfolio. This quarter, we marked a new milestone of 300 patents awarded and an additional 272 patents pending. It is an exciting time as we collaborate with our customers to improve patient outcomes and the standard of care for circulatory support. As a result, the field of heart recovery is growing, and Abiomed is well positioned to capture the $5 billion U.S. market opportunity while planting the seeds for future growth in global markets.
For today's call, I will highlight the clinical need and growing awareness of heart recovery with Impella support in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Starting with the U.S., both the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. Our Impella adoption increased to a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. We continue to have a long runway for growth because of our clinical benefits and FDA approvals. Our focus on training, data and time, combined with independent physician-led initiatives like CHIP and the National CSI, continues to improve awareness and is having an impact on adoption.
Last quarter, I spoke about a publication from The Advisory Board, an independent expert health care consulting company acquired by UnitedHealthcare. This quarter, The Advisory Board circulated 2 additional publications referencing Impella. The first publications comes from the Cardiovascular Roundtable Annual Meeting, Protected PCI, complex coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock were highlighted as advanced programs that enable innovative hospitals to differentiate themselves and capture new market opportunities. As a reference, TAVR and mitral valve are also on this list. The second publication stressed the significant clinical need for the growing cardiogenic shock population. The report outlined the necessity for aligned patient care, recommended tactics for building a cardiogenic shock network and addressed the benefits, ranging from improved quality of care to alleviated cost burden. This timely publication piggybacks on success of this year's TCT physician call to arms around improving outcomes in cardiogenic shock, and this initiative is under way across United States. To be absolutely clear, cardiogenic shock is a major clinical problem with 50% mortality rates, and it has a growing moderately aged population. We support 10% of this population today. What is critical to comprehend is that this is not only about survival. Native heart recovery is the goal. It is superior to just survival to the next therapy, such as heart transplant, and recovery improves patient quality of life and significantly lowers costs. The Advisory Board's recommendations aligned with our Abiomed mission to support hospitals in establishing Impella programs and protocols to improve patient outcomes. As a company, we are encouraged by the mounting attention and awareness from major influencers on the shock crisis.
Moving to our Impella RP commercial launch. We opened 36 new RP sites for a total of 222 hospitals and also set a record for patients supported. For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we now have 15 hospital sites IRB approved that have randomized 26 patients to date, surpassing the halfway point of 50 patients. We are on track to complete the enrollment within our 18-month projection ending in October.
Outside the U.S., we also made significant progress. In Germany, we set new patient records and have penetrated 12% of the annual 25,000 potential patients. In Japan, we have opened 9 of our projected 10 sites for the fiscal year ending in March and generated $1.1 million in revenue in Q3. We are prudently pacing our Japanese launch to ensure quality and optimal outcomes around heart recovery.
I would like to share a story of one of the first patients treated in Tokyo at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. This 68-year-old patient had a history of coronary artery disease and called an ambulance after experiencing severe chest pain. Upon arrival to the hospital, he arrested and required CPR. One of his coronary arteries was 99% blocked, and he was in profound cardiogenic shock with a lactate of 12, signifying severe lack of oxygen in the body. As a reference, one of the characteristics of cardiogenic shock is a lactate of greater than 2 and most people die when it is above 6. The physician inserted Impella 2.5 prior to the PCI in accordance with the clinical best practice of the National Cardiogenic Shock initiative protocol, and the patient remained stable throughout the stenting procedure. After 3 days of Impella support, the patient's lactate normalized and he was successfully weaned off Impella. This patient returned home to his family with his native heart. This story elucidates the strong clinical demand for Impella in a country like Japan with cultural views that limit heart transplants and open-heart surgeries. To date, 123 hospitals have initiated the Impella application process. 66 hospitals have submitted the application, and 31 hospitals are currently approved.
Before concluding, I would like to provide a brief update on the Impella 5.5 and the Impella ECP heart pumps. We remain on track for our first-in-man studies outside the U.S. in the first half of this calendar year and believe both products will further address the clinical needs of interventional cardiologists and heart surgeons. For those that missed our recent Investor Presentation at J.P. Morgan in January, we have posted our presentation on our website, including animations and new product introductions under the Investors section at abiomed.com.
Turning to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance again to approximately $583 million, an increase of approximately 31% from the prior year. This compares to our prior fiscal 2018 guidance of $565 million to $575 million, an increase of 27% to 29%. This projects Q4 revenue to be approximately $164 million, up 31%. We are also again increasing our fiscal year 2018 guidance for operating margin to approximately 26% compared to the prior 23% to 25%.
In summary, this quarter's execution enabled the best results in revenue, operating margin, cash generation, patents and patient utilization in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a company, we are especially proud of our ability to work together with our hospitals to help improve patient outcomes. Abiomed continues to be one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies with increasing GAAP profitability. I want to recognize and thank the team for their dedication to our patients and customers. I also want to express our confidence in the future as we continue to build the field of heart recovery.
I will now turn the call over to our former CFO and current Consultant, Bob Bowen."

Today, I would like to share details on the continued strong growth Abiomed achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As mentioned, fiscal third quarter revenue increased $39.3 million or 34% to $154 million. U.S. Impella revenue rose 30% to $130.7 million, driven by a 33% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $17.3 million and was up 94%. Additionally, worldwide service revenue of $6 million was up 25%. In the U.S., at the end of the fiscal third quarter, the Impella 2.5 has been placed at 1,181 of approximately 1,400 targeted hospital sites for a penetration rate of 84%. Impella CP has been placed at 1,134 hospital sites for a penetration rate of 81%. Impella 5.0 has been placed at 498 sites for a penetration rate of 36% and Impella RP has been placed at 222 sites for a penetration rate of 16%.
Reorder performance was strong for Q3 with U.S. reorders at $125 million and growing 31% versus the prior year and the reorder rate was approximately 100%. Average combined Impella 2.5 and Impella CP inventory at hospital sites rose slightly to 3.75 units per site versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and versus 3.3 units per site in the prior year. Our busier sites carry more inventory as each pump must have a backup pump. In this way, higher patient volume at a given site requires higher levels of safety stock.
Gross margin for the quarter was 83.8% compared to 83.4% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by higher production levels as the company manufactured the most pumps in its history. The favorable effects of higher production volume were partially offset by more console placements, the introduction of new manufacturing lines and the hiring of training of new operators to support growing demand. Because of investments in recent years, we have full manufacturing capability in both Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. We plan to continue to invest in the manufacturing area, particularly the adding of additional operators with related training initiatives and introduce new products and/or product features.
R&D expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $17.7 million and increased 8% from the prior year. The bulk of R&D spending is related to investments in product enhancements and new products as well as research costs from our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study and ongoing cVAD Registry study. We expect to continue investing in product and clinical initiatives in the future.
SG&A expense for the third fiscal quarter totaled $66.6 million, an increase of $12.6 million or 23% from the prior year. We expect to continue expanding our industry-leading commercial team, and we expect to maintain a hiring pace of up to 10 additional U.S. field employees per quarter. We also expect to increase spending in Japan as we support the commercial launch in that country.
Operating income for the third fiscal quarter grew 76% to $44.8 million or 29.1% of revenue compared to $25.4 million or 22.2% of revenue in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was due to strong revenue growth and operational discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model. We will continue to invest in new products, product enhancements, new markets while prioritizing revenue growth and maintaining our operating discipline. We expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 26%.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.4 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income before the recently enacted Tax Reform Act was $32.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $15.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the prior year period. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted net income included income tax expense adjustments of approximately $18.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share due primarily to the recently enacted Tax Reform Act and excess tax benefits on employee share-based compensation awards, which were not applicable in the prior year period. We believe the effects of the Tax Reform Act will reduce our effective tax rate by 8 to 10 points beginning in fiscal 2019. This excludes the impact of excess tax benefits, which we believe will have a lesser effect in fiscal '19 than in fiscal '18.
Also, keep in mind that we are not currently a cash income taxpayer due to our deferred tax assets totaling $75 million. The balance sheet remains debt-free, and we generated $57 million in cash from operating activities to end the quarter with $351 million in cash.
During the quarter, we also closed on the purchase of our Danvers, Massachusetts global headquarters for $16.5 million. Our top priority for use of cash is to support our organic growth with product innovation, distribution, manufacturing and to continue to build our substantial advantage in intellectual property. Abiomed looks forward to continued execution during the fourth quarter. We have important tasks in front of us as we further penetrate Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock markets, roll out Impella in the Japanese market, launch Impella RP with the recent PMA approval and invest in product development and clinical studies. Abiomed will continue its pursuit of industry-leading innovation, growth and execution.

Our goal for the year was that we would open 10 centers by the end of March. So we're ahead of schedule right now with 9 of the 10 opened. Of the $1.1 million in revenue, much of this is initial placement revenue, but we do anticipate some more incremental revenue in Q4. We will, over time, continue to go at a pace faster as we ramp. But we want to make sure that for the first 18 months of our launch, we get great outcomes, we've got rigorous training and compliance because we're also excited to bring the Impella CP and RP and other new products into Japan as soon as possible. And just to remind everyone, Japan is the second-largest medical device market. For cultural reasons, they're not a sternotomy or transplant environment and they also -- unfortunately, for them, they have a smoking population. So we think we can have a major impact in bringing heart recovery to the country. And we currently have 31 employees in Japan, and we're continuing to ramp with the patients."

We are continuing to invest in Q4 in innovation in some of our clinical studies and product enhancements, so we've guided to a 26% for the Q4. But as we've discussed with our 5-year vision, we are pursuing a $1 billion business with a 30%-plus operating margin. And we are probably a little ahead of that 30% rate at this time, which we like, but we continue each year to incrementally move it up. But because of our razor, razorblade model, we believe that we can be best-in-class operating margin, the way we are best-in-class gross margin and growth rates. And that's one of the goals for the company. Relative to your question on outside markets, we are only 12% penetrated in Germany of the 25,000 patients, and we're very confident in that growth going into next year. And as we've mentioned, we will likely frustrate some investors in that our pace in Japan will be methodical, will be slow, but you really are entering a market that not only is it the second-largest market, it has the ability to be a heart-recovery-only clinical environment for us. So as we bring these new products into the country and then some new products around heart failure, we think we have 10-plus years of sustainable growth in Japan. So we really want to get it right with the government. MHLW and PMDA are in charge of all the indications, all the patients and all reimbursement. There's no such thing as an insurance company there, and that's why we want to establish our credibility with them up front and, again, continue to have patient stories like I mentioned where these patients in the past would usually have died or spent an amazing amount of time in the hospital before they died organ at a time, and to be able to send these patients home with their own heart in a shorter period of time is just a tremendous new clinical option that they haven't had in Japan. So we'll continue to execute and we'll continue to deliver best-in-class metrics."

And we said this in the past that we believe that the shock approval would take time to accelerate and would continue for the next 5-plus years, but there is a bit of a seesaw effect that happens between Protected PCI and shock and even our other buckets. So what we're focused on is sustainable growth so that we continue to have the right pace but get the best outcomes, collect data and look for best practices. So I do think that the bigger question is the penetration rate. We are only at 9% blended, so we have a long way to go, but we believe that the best way to continue to accelerate adoption is actually to have great outcomes and improve outcomes each year, which we've done. We will be giving more guidance on the next call for next year, but we certainly feel -- we're very pleased and we're very happy to see the effect of the physician call to arms on shock at TCT. And if you think about how poor outcomes are when you -- only 50% of the patients that go into shock at a hospital live, it's essentially a coin toss. So we think we're going to have a major impact on improving outcomes.

So our targeted population of 100,000 means that of the 1,000 heart hospitals, they each have to do 100, which means that they do 8.3 a month, which means they do 2 a week.

The physician community, in some cases, their focus is just locally. They want to have better protocols at their own hospital, that's one of the reasons that you see a demand for the Impella RP. If you are going to treat profound shock patients, you likely need a right side device and again, that's at 222 sites. You have other hospitals that are working directly with the National CSI group, that's the Detroit initiative and they're submitting their data to that organization and that physician group. And then we have our own sites that are in our cVAD Registry, which is an FDA-audited ongoing study, and we're asking those sites also to switch to the NCSI protocol as well. We do think -- this, in general, is a 43% growth, so that's very strong. And we think it's being spread across the board and it's going to continue to drive adoption as more and more physicians get trained and feel comfortable putting the Impella in. And it's worth noting, this is the second quarter in a row and where the shock or the emergency patients exceeded the Protected PCI coordinator or the Protected PCI patients, but we're also working with coordinators to drive that volume as well.

On the reports that you can look at that are sampled or that are pulled from CMS, they don't always report all the deaths relatives -- or accurately or even when someone has had support. But you're 100% correct, about 1/3 of these sites or 1/3 of these patients are getting any support with the intra-aortic balloon pump, so there's tremendous upside there. The number that is probably the more adequate one to utilize is looking at how many inotropic drugs are used a year. And there's well over 100,000 patients that receive multiple inotropes in order to improve their hemodynamics. And inotropes have been shown to be a predictor of death as you escalate from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. And if you look at just the net effects or the net numbers on deaths in hospitals, well over 300,000 patients die of organ failure or heart failure in the hospital that, again, are relatively young that could benefit from being stabilized with Impella, both on the right and left.

How much momentum -- I know this is -- I'm asking you to put numbers around what is more qualitative, maybe even to talk about it qualitatively, momentum post-TCT. I felt like I came away from TCT hearing similar anticipation around cardiogenic shock and the different initiative that we saw back when CHIP was first implemented, whenever that was at TCT a few years back, right? There was a notable pickup amongst physicians and KOLs on cardiogenic shock. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then following up on that, how we should think about the growth in cardiogenic shock versus high-risk PCI. And how you balance that between -- amongst the sales force and sort of drive a balanced growth outlook between both. Sorry, that was a long question."

The call to arms by the physician community was very rewarding to -- for the company after the work we've done with education and training. And the community, the physician community has acknowledged that it's -- the outcomes for the mortality rate for the last 20 years in cardiogenic shock has been 50%. And the call to arms is that this population, we can do better than 50%. There is a lot of attention to the opioid crisis, and there should be. And there's a lot more we can do. Cardiogenic shock is also a crisis that is responsible for more deaths in the U.S. than the opioid crisis. And again, these are 60 to 70 years old that have more life to live. So we are incredibly focused not just on survival, and I think this is where the momentum is starting to transition, but in native heart recovery because it's one thing to survive and it's another thing to survive and go home with your own heart and go home within a shorter period of time. So that's the ultimate goal and that's where the momentum is starting to occur, the science and the understanding around what is native heart recovery. History also shows that in FDA approval, it's usually the strongest catalyst for market adoption. And this is the first fiscal year we've had full FDA exclusive approvals for high-risk PCI and shock as well as a dedicated DRG. So while we're one of the fastest-growing MedTech companies, changing the practice of medicine can be challenging, and that's why we always go back to our function of training, data and time. And the last point of your question was around how do we balance high-risk PCI. Again, our overall focus is on both high-risk PCI is a population that is out there, that we have to find them and get them referred into our best centers that's why we're doing things like patient awareness campaigns, education, the referring physicians. But in the end, we want to get great outcomes and we want to continue to grow at the right pace that is sustainable and collect our data and publish and share best practices."

We likely do not need to be at most hospitals for Protected PCI. And in many cases, we will swing into the hospital into the ICU because we think we can help standardize protocols, but we also have a 24/7 call center with nurse experts.

And the way the system is set up is that an efficient hospital, the majority of the time, can break even or make a little money. But again, it comes back to the outcomes. And if you get better outcomes, there can be more margin for the hospital, that can be a lower length of stay. And what we do is we impact 2 of the 4 items that all hospitals are ranked on for quality. So Protected PCI helps with their heart failure, helps reduce readmissions as shown in the FDA study. For shock, we tend to -- we've shown the ability to have lower length of stay and, again, native heart recovery. And so we're really helping hospitals improve their metrics that are being tracked by CMS. And with the new reform, hospitals shifted from measuring quality at discharge to quality at 90 days.

In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of over 40% to $174",1355,"Thank you, Ingrid. Good morning, eveyrone. In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of over 40% to $174 million. For the full fiscal year 2018, Abiomed generated $594 million in revenue, with growth of 33% and operating income at $157 million with growth of 74% year-over-year. This year, Abiomed marked several significant milestones and I am proud of our patients first execution and operational discipline from research to manufacturing to customer support. We earned multiple global regulatory approvals in the U.S., Germany, and Japan on new products, new indications and reimbursement.
For today's call, I will cover growth in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock and briefly discuss fiscal '19 expansion with new products, geographies and clinical studies. Q4 success was driven by U.S. patient utilization growth at 35% with Protected PCI in emergent patients at 26%, and 43% respectively. We set new overall U.S. utilization records for every category, best quarter, month, week and day for both Protected PCI and emergent usage. Impella RP also delivered solid results in our second full quarter since the commercial launch with 48 new U.S. sites, and growth of 93% in patients and 154% in revenue. However, Impella adoption is a function of training, data and time. And as a result, we are still in the early innings with the penetration rate of approximately 9% of 231,000 patients in the U.S. alone. To elucidate this adoption process, I would like to share to patient stories.
Mr. Margin Smiley, 77 years old, had bypass surgery in 1989, and more recently began experiencing severe shortness of breath, leaving him unable to walk a few feet without feeling completely fatigued. A primary care physician eventually referred him to a cardiologist at Park West Hospital in Tennessee. Fortunately, Park West Hospital has a protected PSAG coordinator that educates the community on high-risk PCI and identifies appropriate patients that are often turned down for cardiac surgery. The hospital's Protected PCI coordinator reviewed Mr. Smiley's clinical history and scheduled him for a consultation with Dr. [ Iaz Raman ]. On the day of the procedure, Mr. Smiley's heart was failing, and the PCI was performed with Impella CP support during the placement of multiple coronary stents. The procedure went smoothly and Impella was removed. Mr. Smiley was discharged home to his family, and his ejection fraction, a measure of the heart pump power, improved after the procedure. The improvement in ejection fraction is a significant driver of improved quality of life, cost savings and is a unique and validated benefit of Protected PCI. As a result, Mr. Smiley is now back at work, helping customers at Lows.
My second patient story is about cardiogenic shock. Last November, a former governor, Tom Rich, now 72 years old, suffered a massive heart attack while attending a conference in Texas and received CPR at the hotel and in the ambulance for about 30 minutes. Cover in the range arrived at the hospital in dire circumstances and was rushed directly to the cath lab. Upon arrival, the interventional cardiologists immediately and simultaneously inserted the Impella CP and opened up the blockage. After 4 days in the ICU, with Impella unloading his heart and supporting his vital organs the device was explanted. He was later discharged with his native heart, and an improved ejection fraction and returned home.
This past February, I visited the governor in DC, where he was back at work and functioning without the need for an implantable LVAD or heart transplant. From a CMS population perspective, most patient above 65 years old are not candidates for heart transplant and prioritize heart recovery above all other treatment options, based on quality of life and cost. We believe our continued focus on best-practice protocols are driving improved clinical outcomes and adoption. To date, we estimate 200 hospitals have these multidisciplinary shock algorithms, 30 hospitals in 18 cities had joined the independent national cardiogenic shock initiative, and we are in the process of converting 40 hospitals in our CVAD registry to the protocol. The advanced heart hospitals and dedicated physicians are combining our Impella products with improved processes to help patients like Mr. Smiley, and Governor Ridge, not only survive, but avoid the cascade of the most invasive and expensive therapies, because they return to life with their native hearts.
Over the years, the FDA and CMF -- CMS have reviewed our clinical data and cost-effectiveness research and have expanded our FDA PMA labels and allocated a dedicated MS DRG for percutaneous heart pumps. For highest PCI, our new label now accounts for patients with complex anatomy, severe coronary disease and comorbidities with or without reduced ejection fraction. Data supporting this expansion included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients from the cVAD Registry study. The majority of patients were older, more often female, had more hypertension with more lesions treated, including left main and were turned down for open-heart surgery due to risk factors. The data showed that high-risk PCI with Impella support was feasible, safe and achieved favorable outcomes for these patients. This combined patient experience was published in March 2018 in the American Journal of Cardiology, studying 891 patients.
The FDA also expanded our PMA approval for cardiogenic shock, resulting from cardiomyopathy, which incorporates peripartum, postpartum cardiomyopathy SCAD and myocarditis. Abiomed submitted analysis from 93 patients in the cVAD Registry study and a comprehensive literature review, including 109 patients treated with Impella. Both FDA expansions reinforced prior FDA studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness of Impella support in the elective, urgent and emergent patient populations. While we remain focused on the 231,000 U.S, high-risk patient population, we acknowledge that these additional indications expand our addressable market and enable a wider range of patients in the future. We also anticipate steady adoption in both Germany and Japan for 25,000 and 50,000 patients respectively. In Germany, we grew 95% in Q4 and 70% for the year. In Japan, we exceeded our fiscal '18 goal and expect to add $10 million in revenue in fiscal '19 under a controlled launch.
Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to some new pipeline opportunities. In Q4, Abiomed received European CE mark approval for the Impella 5.5 pump and treated our first set of patients in Germany. The Impella 5.5 is a heart recovery pump, because it provides physicians a minimally invasive, 30-day, ambulatory, weanable, forward flow, unloading heart device with peak flows above 6 liters. The device is also designed for a 60-minute axillary implant that avoids a sternotomy. While not yet approved in the U.S., we expect the Impella 5.5 to further enhance Abiomed's product and significantly advanced field of heart recovery for both chronic and acute patients requiring longer-term hemodynamic support.
For our STEMI DTU FEA feasibility study, we are somewhat ahead of schedule and enrollment is near-complete with 46 of the 50 patient randomized. Therefore, we anticipate earlier completion of enrollment by mid- to late summer versus October.
We are excited to test our hypothesis that unloading within Impella before revascularization may reduce re-perfusion injury in the setting up acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock. We look forward to analyzing the feasibility clinical data and if successful, designing the larger pivotal randomized controlled trial.
In closing, we enter fiscal '19 with purpose and confidence in our mission to recover hearts and save lives. We finished the year achieving records on nearly every clinical and business metric and fortified our leadership position with expanded distribution, training facilities, manufacturing capacity, 317 patents, 311 patents pending and $400 million in cash. Fiscal 2019 is positioned to be another outstanding year, and we appreciate the investment from our shareholders. I'm also grateful to the dedicated employees, and customers that have enabled us to serve our patient and achieve our corporate goals around heart recoveries. I would now like to officially welcome and introduce our new CFO, Todd Trapp. We are extremely pleased to have Todd on the team and know he will further improve our execution in the future."

And before I get started, I just want to say that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholder on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future. Now let's get into the financial results. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $174 million, an increase of $50 million or 40% versus last year. U.S. Impella revenue rose 35% to $146 million, driven by a 35% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $22 million and was up 17%, mainly driven by a performance apartments in Germany. In the quarter, our German revenue increased 95% versus last year, due to continued patient utilization and a greater adoption associated with high-risk PCI. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year. In the U.S., at the end of fiscal 2018, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at 1,197 and 1,172 sites of the targeted 1,400 hospitals. Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 516 and 270 sites respectfully. Both of 5.0 and RP are now being adopted by more sites and have significant runway.
Reorder performance continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorders increase 35% to $140 million versus prior year, which translated into our reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP, rose slightly to 3.8 units per site, versus 3.7 in the perior quarter; and 3.4 units per site in the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 82.7% compared to 84.6% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to higher manufacturing of investments to support future topline growth as well as the geographic mix. Our D&E expense for the quarter totaled $21 million or 31% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was related to investments in new products, including enhancements and higher clinical costs related to STEMI and cVAD Registry studies.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter totaled $76 million, an increase of $15 million or 26% versus prior year. Incremental investments to expand our industry-leading U.S. commercial team and to support the Japanese commercial launch were the main driver of the increase.
Operating income improved grew 64% to $48 million in Q4. This translated into an operating margin of 27.3%, an increase of 400 basis points versus prior year. The strong margin expansion was due to higher patient volume and continued operating discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $37 million or $0.80 per diluted share versus $0.33 in Q4 of '17. The year-over-year net income increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and excess tax benefits associated with our equity awards.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. In the quarter, we generated $49 million of cash from operating activities. As a result, we ended the year with $400 million of cash. Our top priority for deployment continues to be supporting organic growth initiatives, including building on our intellectual property advantage.
Now, I'll make a few comments on our record setting fiscal 2018. For the year, we delivered revenue of $594 million, an increase of 33% or $149 million versus prior year. We saw broad based growth in both the U.S. can outside the U.S. due to continued adoption of the entire Impella platform. For the year, operating income was $157 million, up 74% compared to the prior year. We delivered operating margins of 26.5%, while continuing to make the necessary investments to support our future growth initiatives. GAAP net income for the year was a $112 million or $2.45 per diluted share versus $52 million or $1.17 in the prior year. The 100-plus percent increase was again driven by strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate.
Finally, we increased our cash position by $123 million during the year, while investing in our infrastructure, and manufacturing capacity. And we remain debt free. Lastly, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2019. As noted in the earnings release, we expect 2019 revenue to be in the range of $740 million to $770 million, which translates to 25% to 30% growth for the year. The guidance is based on the following assumptions: Continued penetration of the existing and expanded markets for Protected PCI in cardiogenic shock; accelerated growth in Impella RP post PMA approvals and approximately $10 million in revenue from Japan. The business continues to expand rapidly, and our growth rates are in line with our 5-year vision outlined back in the 2015. We will continue with our patients-first sustainable growth model. 
I would also like to remind investors of the seasonality of the fiscal year as we typically do when issuing guidance. In Q1, our field team was brought in to headquarters for extensive annual training and also tend to take their vacations of busy Q4. Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations so we expect revenue at or just under the Q1 pace. In Q3, we typically see significant sequential lift based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement.
In Q4, our March quarter, we have our best results as we end our fiscal year. Therefore,, we would expect second-half revenues to represent approximately 55% of our total year.
Turning to operating margins. We expect our fiscal year 2019 margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%, showing continued leverage in progress towards our 30% plus patient. Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, while delivering improvements in operating leverage. These investments will enable us to grow we are new product enhancement, including sensing technology, geographies, clinical studies and quarter platforms, including Impella CP, Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. These investments will continue to lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes, and sustaining long-term growth. As it relates to the tax rate for fiscal year 2019, we are consistent with what we communicated during our last earnings call. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards, we expect a full year tax rate to fall in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary, as we close out our successful 2018, we look forward to work new year of continued execution, as we build the field of heart recovery. Operator, please now open the line for questions."

Impella also significantly reduced the risk of dialysis, which increases mortality, lent of stay and cost so the answer is, yes. We do have a more extensive research that will be coming out over the next 2 to 3 years. And what we believe is happening, is the forward flow driving more blood flow to the kidneys is of hormonal benefit, it increases urine production, and it allows the kidneys to remove impurities in the blood. One of the Achilles heels of all of PCI are now also now TAVR is acute kidney injury because of the contrast because of the stress to the heart and what the kidneys can do is sometimes shut down.

So first on the new EF.

And we do think it will have an impact and I think it will have an impact also in identifying patients that just do better with hemodynamic support so it allows them to do longer inflations, potentially atherectomy, potentially reduced acute kidney injury so we don't think it will have an impact and we're watching as it goes out and it takes time for this information to filter. The second question on the reinvestment, what's happened is, CMS has now created a dedicated code for percutaneous heart pumps, it is now Cath Lab only patients as well as the ICU emergency patients or all NDRG 215, they maintained that the focus on support and biventricular support and they also gave -- permanently created a DRG for biventricular Impella.

When they do the analysis that is being proposed and potentially can take affect now it's our October, they usually looking at a subset of data that is 2 years old, and that data may or may not have the most recent trends of more emergency patients than elective patients. But the nice thing about the process is one, if a hospital gets better outcomes
[Audio Gap]
ensure that the hospitals can do the right things for the patient, and have a win-win for both the system itself with heart recovery, but also for patients that they can avoid having to go down the cascade of more surgeries and potentially a transplant."

There essentially was no additional support, and many of the hospitals per transfer will not receive any reimbursement for patient management in explant of Impella.

So the growth in Germany is a function of [indiscernible], [indiscernible] and [indiscernible], which is training, data and time in gentlemen. It's was happening as you mentioned we do 95% in the quarter, you have a couple of factors. 1 is we have been adding to the distribution, and we have a training center now in Auchen Germany so that's been very beneficial to have physicians come in where we go through hemodynamic science best practices. We've also seen an increase in the mix of increase in high-risk PCI. Years ago, Germany was 95% shock patients and now we have high-risk PCI growing. The third is that it's just continued reinforcement that in Germany, the intra-aortic bloom pump is a Class III for cardiogenic shock, which means that it's harmful for patients. And then we're now active with over 200 hospitals and there are 600 to go in Germany so we're making progress in opening new centers with our added distribution. And as we do that will continue to grow both indications but also -- we'll go deeper in new site and that drives strong growth itself. Your question on the 5.5, the answer is it's a little bit of cannibalization, because it will replace completely the 5.0, but because it's longer-term the CE mark is for 30 days, because it's peak flow is about 6 liters, it will have an optical sensor because patient can get up and ambulate there is a lot of interest in new science of unloading, we will match the Impella use things with stem cells or immunosuppressant drugs, but there is no question that when you put up 5.5 in the patient, it completely unloads them, their kidneys make urine, patient feel better, and they can get up and move around because it's designed for the implant and it avoids the sternotomy. So we're very excited. We're going to go slow and steady, we're going to collect data to publish, and we're going to work with the FDA early so they really understand how this product will replace the Impella 5.0."

And the reason is because it requires a heart team, and it requires an approach and an implementation of best practices so that takes a group of people. One of the things that's very rewarding for us is the Detroit CSI program, cardiogenic shock initiative is now national. It's independent of Abiomed, and it's kind of a call-to-arms by physicians to enable not only the Impella but better processes of putting the Impella in before the PCI using a catheter to monitor the patient, and we just had a recent publication showing that the Impella CP has a even higher survival effect over the Impella 2.5. So there is lots of information in there, we love seeing the improvement in outcomes. And we really enjoy meeting these patient and seeing them having the ability to go home with their own hearts so it's working well is going.

The current DTU study are patients that are not having cardiogenic shock so we do not treat any of them today. The thesis that we're testing is not just the unloading benefit of Impella where it takes the work demand and reduces the oxygen demand for the heart, it's -- and there is a publication on this thesis. It's that the unloading of Impella preconditions the myocardium so when the patient is revascularized where they open up the blockage that, that preconditioning of Impella will reduce the reperfusion injury that happens in the normal process and standard of care today where they try to open clogged arteries within 90 minutes. And reperfusion injury results from that solution, because what happens is there is a process called apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, and that's why patients today that survive heart attacks, again, the average -- the statistics are that 70% of these patients that survived the first heart attack will suffer from heart failure in 5 years. So we think that this has really a huge impact in looking at the way STEMI patients are treated. If it is not successful, it does not change the fact that Impella is proven to reduce the oxygen demand, it doesn't -- it's proven to help increase cardiac power, it reduce acute kidney injury and multiple benefits that we've already started with the FDA. What's unique about this again now is it's new science on what unloading tests in the preconditioning, and help to reduce reperfusion injury."

One note that is important that just happened in Japan is the Japanese Society guidelines just came out with the classification, and they have downgraded the intra-aortic balloon pump to Class III and cardiogenic shock, which again Class III means is potentially harmful to patients and is not recommended.

You also have multiple indications so you may have an interventional cardiologist using it for high-risk PCI, but not for shock or vice versa.

In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of over 40% to $174",1353,"Thank you, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of over 40% to $174 million. For the full fiscal year 2018, Abiomed generated $594 million in revenue, with growth of 33%, and operating income at $157 million with growth of 74% year-over-year. This year, Abiomed marked several significant milestones, and I am proud of our patients first execution and operational discipline from research to manufacturing to customer support. We earned multiple global regulatory approvals in the U.S., Germany, and Japan on new products, new indications and reimbursement.
For today's call, I will cover growth in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock and briefly discuss fiscal '19 expansion with new products, geographies and clinical studies. Q4 success was driven by U.S. patient utilization growth at 35% with Protected PCI in emergent patients at 26%, and 43% respectively. We set new overall U.S. utilization records for every category, best quarter, month, week and day for both Protected PCI and emergent usage. 
Impella RP also delivered solid results in our second full quarter since the commercial launch with 48 new U.S. sites, and growth of 93% in patients and 154% in revenue. However, Impella adoption is a function of training, data and time. And as a result, we are still in the early innings with the penetration rate of approximately 9% of 231,000 patients in the U.S. alone. To elucidate this adoption process, I would like to share 2 patient stories.
Mr. Martin Smiley, 77 years old, had bypass surgery in 1989, and more recently began experiencing severe shortness of breath, leaving him unable to walk a few feet without feeling completely fatigued. A primary care physician eventually referred him to a cardiologist at Park West Hospital in Tennessee. Fortunately, Park West Hospital has a protected PCI coordinator that educates the community on high-risk PCI and identifies appropriate patients that are often turned down for cardiac surgery. The hospital's Protected PCI coordinator reviewed Mr. Smiley's clinical history and scheduled him for a consultation with Dr. Ayaz Rahman. On the day of the procedure, Mr. Smiley's heart was failing, and the PCI was performed with Impella CP support during the placement of multiple coronary stents. The procedure went smoothly and Impella was removed. Mr. Smiley was discharged home to his family, and his ejection fraction, a measure of the heart pump power, improved after the procedure. The improvement in ejection fraction is a significant driver of improved quality of life, cost savings and is a unique and validated benefit of Protected PCI. As a result, Mr. Smiley is now back at work, helping customers at Lows.
My second patient story is about cardiogenic shock. Last November, former governor, Tom Ridge, now 72 years old, suffered a massive heart attack while attending a conference in Texas and received CPR at the hotel and in the ambulance for about 30 minutes. Governor Ridge arrived at the hospital in dire circumstances and was rushed directly to the cath lab. Upon arrival, the interventional cardiologists immediately and simultaneously inserted the Impella CP and opened up the blockage. After 4 days in the ICU, with Impella unloading his heart and supporting his vital organs the device was explanted. He was later discharged with his native heart, and in improved ejection fraction and returned home.
This past February, I visited the governor in DC, where he was back at work and functioning without the need for an implantable LVAD or heart transplant. From a CMS population perspective, most patients above 65 years old are not candidates for heart transplant and prioritize heart recovery above all other treatment options, based on quality of life and cost. We believe our continued focus on best-practice protocols are driving improved clinical outcomes and adoption. To date, we estimate 200 hospitals have these multidisciplinary shock algorithms, 30 hospitals in 18 cities had joined the independent National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, and we are in the process of converting 40 hospitals in our cVAD Registry to the protocol. The advance heart hospitals and dedicated physicians are combining our Impella products with improved processes to help patients like Mr. Smiley, and Governor Ridge, not only survive, but avoid the cascade of the most invasive and expensive therapies, because they returned to life with their native hearts.
Over the years, the FDA and CMF -- CMS have reviewed our clinical data and cost-effectiveness research and have expanded our existing FDA, PMA labels and allocated a dedicated MS-DRG for percutaneous heart pumps. 
For highest PCI, our new label now accounts for patients with complex anatomy, severe coronary artery disease and comorbidities with or without reduced ejection fraction. Data supporting this expansion included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients from the cVAD Registry study. The majority of patients were older, more often female, had more hypertension with more lesions treated, including left main and were turned down for open-heart surgery due to risk factors. The data show that high-risk PCI with Impella support was feasible, safe and achieved favorable outcomes for these patients. This combined patient experience was published in March 2018, in the American Journal of Cardiology, studying 891 patients.
The FDA also expanded our PMA approval for cardiogenic shock, resulting from cardiomyopathy, which incorporates peripartum, postpartum cardiomyopathy, SCAD and myocarditis. Abiomed submitted analysis from 93 patients in the cVAD Registry study and a comprehensive literature review, including 109 patients treated with Impella. 
Both FDA expansions reinforced prior FDA studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness of Impella support in the elective, urgent and emergent patient populations. While we remain focused on the 231,000 U.S, high-risk patient population, we acknowledge that these additional indications expand our addressable market and enable a wider range of patients in the future. We also anticipate steady adoption in both Germany and Japan for 25,000 and 50,000 patients respectively. In Germany, we grew 95% in Q4 and 70% for the year. In Japan, we exceeded our fiscal '18 goal and expect to add $10 million in revenue in fiscal '19 under a controlled launch.
Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to some new pipeline opportunities. In Q4, Abiomed received European CE Mark approval for the Impella 5.5 pump and treated our first set of patients in Germany. The Impella 5.5 is a heart recovery pump, because it provides physicians a minimally invasive, 30-day, ambulatory, weanable, forward flow, unloading heart device with peak flows above 6 liters. The device is also designed for a 60-minute axillary implant that avoids a sternotomy. While not yet approved in the U.S., we expect the Impella 5.5 to further enhance Abiomed's product portfolio, and significantly advance the field of heart recovery, for both chronic and acute patients requiring longer-term hemodynamic support.
For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we are somewhat ahead of schedule and enrollment is near-complete with 46 of the 50 patient randomized. Therefore, we anticipate earlier completion of enrollment by mid- to late summer versus October.
We are excited to test our hypothesis that unloading with Impella before revascularization may reduce re-perfusion injury in the setting of acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock. We look forward to analyzing the feasibility clinical data and if successful, designing the larger pivotal randomized controlled trial.
In closing, we enter fiscal '19 with purpose and confidence in our mission to recover hearts and save lives. We finished the year achieving records on nearly every clinical and business metric and fortified our leadership position with expanded distribution, training facilities, manufacturing capacity, 317 patents, 311 patents pending and $400 million in cash. Fiscal 2019 is positioned to be another outstanding year, and we appreciate the investment from our shareholders. I'm also grateful to the dedicated employees, and customers that have enabled us to serve our patient and achieve our corporate goals around heart recovery. 
I would now like to officially welcome and introduce our new CFO, Todd Trapp. We are extremely pleased to have Todd on the team and know he will further improve our execution in the future."

And before I get started, I just want to say, that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholder on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future. 
So now let's get into the financial results. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $174 million, an increase of $50 million or 40% versus last year. U.S. Impella revenue rose 35% to $146 million, driven by a 35% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $22 million and was up 107%, mainly driven by our performance in Germany. In the quarter, our German revenue increased 95% versus last year, due to continued patient utilization and a greater adoption associated with high-risk PCI. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year. In the U.S., at the end of fiscal year 2018, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at 1,197 and 1,172 sites of the targeted 1,400 hospitals. Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 516 and 270 sites, respectfully. Both the 5.0 and RP are now being adopted by more sites and have significant runway.
Reorder performance continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorders increase 35% to $140 million versus prior year, which translated into our reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP, rose slightly to 3.8 units per site, versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and 3.4 units per site in the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 82.7% compared to 84.6% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to higher manufacturing investments to support future topline growth as well as geographic mix. Our [ D&E ] expense for the fourth quarter totaled $21 million, a 31% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was related to investments in new products, including enhancements and higher clinical costs related to STEMI and cVAD Registry studies.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter totaled $76 million, an increase of $15 million or 26% versus prior year. Incremental investments to expand our industry-leading U.S. commercial team and to support the Japanese commercial launch were the main drivers of the increase.
Operating income grew 64% to $48 million in Q4. This translated into an operating margin of 27.3%, an increase of 400 basis points versus prior year. The strong margin expansion was due to higher patient volume and continued operating discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $37 million or $0.80 per diluted share versus $0.33 in Q4 of '17. The year-over-year net income increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and excess tax benefits associated with our equity awards.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. In the quarter, we generated $49 million of cash from operating activities. As a result, we ended the year with $400 million of cash. Our top priority for deployment continues to be supporting organic growth initiatives, including building on our intellectual property advantage.
Now, I'll make a few comments on our record setting fiscal 2018. For the year, we delivered revenue of $594 million, an increase of 33% or $149 million versus prior year. We saw broad base growth in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. due to continued adoption of the entire Impella platform. For the year, operating income was $157 million, up 74% compared to the prior year. We delivered operating margins of 26.5%, while continuing to make the necessary investments to support our future growth initiatives. GAAP net income for the year was a $112 million or $2.45 per diluted share versus $52 million or $1.17 in the prior year. The 100-plus percent increase was again driven by strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate.
Finally, we increased our cash position by $123 million during the year, while investing in our infrastructure, and manufacturing capacity and we remain debt free. 
Lastly, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2019. As noted in the earnings release, we expect 2019 revenue to be in the range of $740 million to $770 million, which translates to 25% to 30% growth for the year. The guidance is based on the following assumptions: Continued penetration of the existing and expanded markets for Protected PCI in cardiogenic shock; accelerated growth in Impella RP post PMA approval and approximately $10 million in revenue from Japan. The business continues to expand rapidly, and our growth rates are in line with our 5-year vision outlined back in 2015. We will continue with our patients-first sustainable growth model.
I would also like to remind investors of the seasonality of the fiscal year as we typically do when issuing guidance. In Q1, our field team was brought in to headquarters for extensive annual training and also tend to take their vacations after a busy Q4. Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to summer time slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. So we expect revenue at or just under the Q1 pace. In Q3, we typically see significant sequential lift based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement.
In Q4, our March quarter, we have our best results as we end our fiscal year. Therefore, we would expect second-half revenues to represent approximately 55% of our total year.
Turning to operating margins. We expect our fiscal year 2019 margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%, showing continued leverage in progress towards our 30% plus vision. Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, while delivering improvements in operating leverage. These investments will enable us to grow via new product enhancements, including sensing technology, geographies, clinical studies and product platforms, including Impella ECP, the Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. These investments will continue to lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. As it relates to the tax rate for fiscal year 2019, we are consistent with what we communicated during our last earnings call. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-base compensation awards, we expect the full year tax rate to fall in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary, as we close out our successful 2018, we look forward to a new year of continued execution, as we build the field of heart recovery.

Impella has been recently showing a protective kidney function, and lower ejection fractions, undergoing PCI. Is this an angle that the company is exploring with new perspective evidence development?"

Impella also significantly reduced the risk of dialysis, which is, increases mortality, length of stay and cost. So the answer is, yes. We do have more extensive research that will be coming out over the next 2 to 3 years. And what we believe is happening, is the forward flow driving more blood flow to the kidneys, has a hormonal benefit, it increases urine production and it allows the kidneys to remove impurities in the blood. One of the Achilles heels of all of PCI and now also TAVR is acute kidney injury, because of the contrast, because of the stress to the heart and what the kidneys can do is sometimes shut down. So you'll be seeing, over the next 3 years, a lot of publications around the research, the basic science, but also you'll be seeing this in patients and studies that are happening both in Europe and the U.S. in the future."

So first on the new EF. The patient population, if there are already surgical turndown and they have everything I described about comorbidities or complex anatomy or severe coronary diseases, they don't have the option to go to surgery if something goes wrong. And we do think it will have an impact, and I think it will have an impact also in identifying patients that just do better with hemodynamic support. So it allows them to do longer inflations, potentially atherectomy, potentially reduce acute kidney injury, so we do think it will have an impact, and we're watching it as it goes out and it takes time for this information to filter. The second question on the reimbursement. What's happened is, CMS has now created a dedicated code for percutaneous heart pumps, it is now cath lab only patients as well as the ICU emergency patients, are all in DRG 215. They maintained the focus on biventricular support and they also gave -- permanently created a DRG for biventricular Impella. So we think the simplicity of having everything together will be beneficial, but we'll watch it and make that we have appropriate use and appropriate reimbursement. When they do the analysis, that is being proposed and potentially it can take effect next October. They are usually looking at a subset of data that's 2 years old, and that data may or may not have the most recent trends of more emergency patients than elective patients. But the nice thing about the process is one, if a hospital gets better outcomes

ensure that the hospitals can do the right things for the patient, and have a win-win for both the system itself with heart recovery, but also for patients that they can avoid having to go down the cascade of more surgeries and potentially a transplant."

So as the balance goes, we work with it, but just to remind all our investors, 3 years ago, we were being paid at a lower rate for a mix between DRG 216 and 221, the coding was difficult, we did not have biventricular support with Impella. There essentially was no additional support, and many of the hospitals per transfer would not receive any reimbursement for patient management in explant of Impella.

So that's been very beneficial to have physicians come in where we go through hemodynamic science best practices. We've also seen an increase in the mix of increase in high-risk PCI. Years ago, Germany was 95% shock patients and now we have high-risk PCI growing. The third is that, it just continued reinforcement, that in Germany, the intra-aortic balloon pump is a Class III for cardiogenic shock, which means, that it's harmful for patients.

There is a lot of interest in new science of unloading, we will match the Impella use, things with stem cells or immunosuppressant drugs, but there is no question that when you put the 5.5 in a patient, it completely unloads them, their kidneys make urine, patients feel better, and they can get up and move around because it's designed for the axillary implant and it avoids the sternotomy. So we're very excited. We're going to go slow and steady, we're going to collect data to publish, and we're going to work with the FDA early so they understand how this product will replace the Impella 5.0."

And it -- the reason is just because it requires a heart team, and it requires an approach and an implementation of best practices, so that takes a group of people. One of the things that's very rewarding for us, is the Detroit CSI program, Cardiogenic Shock Initiative is now national. It's independent of Abiomed, and it's kind of a call-to-arms by physicians to enable not only the Impella, but better processes of putting the Impella in before the PCI, using a catheter to monitor the patient. And we just had a recent publication showing that the Impella CP has a even higher survival effect over the Impella 2.5. So there is lots of information in there, we love seeing the improvement in outcomes. And we really enjoy meeting these patients and seeing them having the ability to go home with their own hearts. So it's working well, it's growing. But again, the key to success and sustainable growth, is getting these improving outcomes and native heart recovery."

The current DTU study are patients that are not having cardiogenic shock, so we do not treat any of them today. The thesis that we're testing is not just the unloading benefits of Impella, where it takes the work demand and reduces the oxygen demand for the heart, it's the -- and there is a publication on this thesis. It's that the unloading of Impella preconditions the myocardium, so when the patient is revascularized, where they open up the blockage, that, that preconditioning of Impella will reduce the reperfusion injury that happens in the normal process and standard of care today, where they try to open the clogged artery within 90 minutes. And reperfusion injury results from that solution, because what happens is there is a process called apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, and that's why patients today that survive heart attacks, again, the average is -- the statistics are that 70% of these patients that survived their first heart attack will suffer from heart failure in 5 years. So we think that this has really a huge impact in looking at the way STEMI patients are treated. If it is not successful, it does not change the fact that Impella is proven to reduce the oxygen demand, it doesn't -- it's been proven to help increase coronary -- cardiac power, it reduced acute kidney injury and multiple other benefits that we've already studied with the FDA. What's unique about this again though is, it's new science on what unloading does in preconditioning and helping to reduce reperfusion injury."

One note that is important, that just happened in Japan, is the Japanese Society Guidelines just came out with a classification, and they have downgraded the intra-aortic balloon pump to Class III in cardiogenic shock, which again Class III means, it's potentially harmful to patients and it's not recommended. So, we're glad to see that, that guideline has been updated and we're very excited again to bring our best practices to Japan, to drive native heart recovery as a standard of care.

There's a lot of physicians that are a little bit nervous to close a 12-French or 14-French hole. So, I would say, it's not 60% for interventional cardiologists yet. You also have multiple indications, so you may have an interventional cardiologist using it for high-risk PCI, but not for shock or vice versa. For surgeons, we have only penetrated about half the market with the 5.0, so the 5.0 has got a long way to go and again, we think the 5.5 will replace that and we'll be at all 1,000 heart hospitals in the U.S. alone. In the RP we're only 19% penetrated in the install base. So we have essentially, many years ahead of new doctors, new indications and new products into all the existing U.S. hospitals in our current install base. So we're very excited, but again as we train people, we train to get the best outcomes both for high-risk PCI and for cardiogenic shock."

In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of 40% to $174 million. For the full fiscal year 2018, Abiomed generated $594 million in revenue, with growth of 33%, and operating income at $157 million with growth of 74% year-over-year. This year, Abiomed marked several significant milestones, and I am proud of our patients first execution and operational discipline from research to manufacturing to customer support. We earned multiple global regulatory approvals in the U.S., Germany and Japan on new products, new indications and reimbursement.
For today's call, I will cover growth in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock and briefly discuss fiscal '19 expansion with new products, geographies and clinical studies. Q4 success was driven by U.S. patient utilization growth at 35% with Protected PCI in emergent patients at 26% and 43%, respectively. We set new overall U.S. utilization records for every category, best quarter, month, week and day for both Protected PCI and emergent usage. 
Impella RP also delivered solid results in our second full quarter since the commercial launch with 48 new U.S. sites, and growth of 93% in patients and 154% in revenue. However, Impella adoption is a function of training, data and time. And as a result, we are still in the early innings with the penetration rate of approximately 9% of 231,000 patients in the U.S. alone. To elucidate this adoption process, I would like to share 2 patient stories.
Mr. Martin Smiley, 77 years old, had bypass surgery in 1989, and more recently began experiencing severe shortness of breath, leaving him unable to walk a few feet without feeling completely fatigued. A primary care physician eventually referred him to a cardiologist at Park West Hospital in Tennessee. Fortunately, Park West Hospital has a protected PCI coordinator that educates the community on high-risk PCI and identifies appropriate patients that are often turned down for cardiac surgery. The hospital's Protected PCI coordinator reviewed Mr. Smiley's clinical history and scheduled him for a consultation with Dr. Ayaz Rahman. On the day of the procedure, Mr. Smiley's heart was failing, and the PCI was performed with Impella CP support during the placement of multiple coronary stents. The procedure went smoothly and Impella was removed. Mr. Smiley was discharged home to his family, and his ejection fraction, a measure of the heart pump power, improved after the procedure. The improvement in ejection fraction is a significant driver of improved quality of life, cost savings and is a unique and validated benefit of Protected PCI. As a result, Mr. Smiley is now back at work, helping customers at Lowes.
My second patient story is about cardiogenic shock. Last November, former governor, Tom Ridge, now 72 years old, suffered a massive heart attack while attending a conference in Texas and received CPR at the hotel and in the ambulance for about 30 minutes. Governor Ridge arrived at the hospital in dire circumstances and was rushed directly to the cath lab. Upon arrival, the interventional cardiologists immediately and simultaneously inserted the Impella CP and opened up the blockage. After 4 days in the ICU, with Impella unloading his heart and supporting his vital organs, the device was explanted. He was later discharged with his native heart, and in improved ejection fraction and returned home.
This past February, I visited the governor in DC, where he was back at work and functioning without the need for an implantable LVAD or heart transplant. From a CMS population perspective, most patients above 65 years old are not candidates for heart transplant and prioritize heart recovery above all other treatment options, based on quality of life and cost. We believe our continued focus on best-practice protocols are driving improved clinical outcomes and adoption. To date, we estimate 200 hospitals have these multidisciplinary shock algorithms, 30 hospitals in 18 cities had joined the independent National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, and we are in the process of converting 40 hospitals in our cVAD Registry to the protocol. The advance heart hospitals and dedicated physicians are combining our Impella products with improved processes to help patients like Mr. Smiley and Governor Ridge, not only survive, but avoid the cascade of the most invasive and expensive therapies, because they returned to life with their native hearts.
Over the years, the FDA and CMF -- CMS have reviewed our clinical data and cost-effectiveness research and have expanded our existing FDA, PMA labels and allocated a dedicated MS-DRG for percutaneous heart pumps. 
For highest PCI, our new label now accounts for patients with complex anatomy, severe coronary artery disease and comorbidities with or without reduced ejection fraction. Data supporting this expansion included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients from the cVAD Registry study. The majority of patients were older, more often female, had more hypertension with more lesions treated, including left main and were turned down for open-heart surgery due to risk factors. The data showed that high-risk PCI with Impella support was feasible, safe and achieved favorable outcomes for these patients. This combined patient experience was published in March 2018, in the American Journal of Cardiology, studying 891 patients.
The FDA also expanded our PMA approval for cardiogenic shock, resulting from cardiomyopathy, which incorporates peripartum, postpartum cardiomyopathy, SCAD and myocarditis. Abiomed submitted analysis from 93 patients in the cVAD Registry study and a comprehensive literature review, including 109 patients treated with Impella. 
Both FDA expansions reinforced prior FDA studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness of Impella support in the elective, urgent and emergent patient populations. While we remain focused on the 231,000 U.S high-risk patient population, we acknowledge that these additional indications expand our addressable market and enable a wider range of patients in the future. We also anticipate steady adoption in both Germany and Japan for 25,000 and 50,000 patients respectively. In Germany, we grew 95% in Q4 and 70% for the year. In Japan, we exceeded our fiscal '18 goal and expect to add $10 million in revenue in fiscal '19 under a controlled launch.
Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to some new pipeline opportunities. In Q4, Abiomed received European CE Mark approval for the Impella 5.5 pump and treated our first set of patients in Germany. The Impella 5.5 is a heart recovery pump, because it provides physicians a minimally invasive, 30-day, ambulatory, weanable, forward flow, unloading heart device with peak flows above 6 liters. The device is also designed for a 60-minute axillary implant that avoids a sternotomy. While not yet approved in the U.S., we expect the Impella 5.5 to further enhance Abiomed's product portfolio, and significantly advance the field of heart recovery, for both chronic and acute patients requiring longer-term hemodynamic support.
For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we are somewhat ahead of schedule and enrollment is near-complete with 46 of the 50 patients randomized. Therefore, we anticipate earlier completion of enrollment by mid- to late summer versus October.
We are excited to test our hypothesis that unloading with Impella before revascularization may reduce re-perfusion injury in the setting of acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock. We look forward to analyzing the feasibility clinical data and, if successful, designing the larger pivotal randomized controlled trial.
In closing, we enter fiscal '19 with purpose and confidence in our mission to recover hearts and save lives. We finished the year achieving records on nearly every clinical and business metric and fortified our leadership position with expanded distribution, training facilities, manufacturing capacity, 317 patents, 311 patents pending and $400 million in cash. Fiscal 2019 is positioned to be another outstanding year, and we appreciate the investment from our shareholders. I'm also grateful to the dedicated employees and customers that have enabled us to serve our patient and achieve our corporate goals around heart recovery. 
I would now like to officially welcome and introduce our new CFO, Todd Trapp. We are extremely pleased to have Todd on the team and know he will further improve our execution in the future."

And before I get started, I just want to say, that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholders on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future.

And before I get started, I just want to say, that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholders on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future. 
So now let's get into the financial results. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $174 million, an increase of $50 million or 40% versus last year. U.S. Impella revenue rose 35% to $146 million, driven by a 35% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $22 million and was up 107%, mainly driven by our performance in Germany. In the quarter, our German revenue increased 95% versus last year, due to continued patient utilization and a greater adoption associated with high-risk PCI. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year. In the U.S., at the end of fiscal year 2018, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at 1,197 and 1,172 sites of the targeted 1,400 hospitals. Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 516 and 270 sites, respectfully. Both the 5.0 and RP are now being adopted by more sites and have significant runway.
Reorder performance continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorders increased 35% to $140 million versus prior year, which translated into our reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP, rose slightly to 3.8 units per site, versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and 3.4 units per site in the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 82.7% compared to 84.6% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to higher manufacturing investments to support future topline growth as well as geographic mix. Our D&E expense for the fourth quarter totaled $21 million, a 31% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was related to investments in new products, including enhancements and higher clinical costs related to STEMI and cVAD Registry studies.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter totaled $76 million, an increase of $15 million or 26% versus prior year. Incremental investments to expand our industry-leading U.S. commercial team and to support the Japanese commercial launch were the main drivers of the increase.
Operating income grew 64% to $48 million in Q4. This translated into an operating margin of 27.3%, an increase of 400 basis points versus prior year. The strong margin expansion was due to higher patient volume and continued operating discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $37 million or $0.80 per diluted share versus $0.33 in Q4 of '17. The year-over-year net income increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and excess tax benefits associated with our equity awards.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. In the quarter, we generated $49 million of cash from operating activities. As a result, we ended the year with $400 million of cash. Our top priority for deployment continues to be supporting organic growth initiatives, including building on our intellectual property advantage.
Now, I'll make a few comments on our record setting fiscal 2018. For the year, we delivered revenue of $594 million, an increase of 33% or $149 million versus prior year. We saw broad base growth in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. due to continued adoption of the entire Impella platform. For the year, operating income was $157 million, up 74% compared to the prior year. We delivered operating margins of 26.5%, while continuing to make the necessary investments to support our future growth initiatives. GAAP net income for the year was $112 million or $2.45 per diluted share versus $52 million or $1.17 in the prior year. The 100-plus percent increase was again driven by strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate.
Finally, we increased our cash position by $123 million during the year, while investing in our infrastructure, and manufacturing capacity and we remain debt free. 
Lastly, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2019. As noted in the earnings release, we expect 2019 revenue to be in the range of $740 million to $770 million, which translates to 25% to 30% growth for the year. The guidance is based on the following assumptions: continued penetration of the existing and expanded markets for Protected PCI in cardiogenic shock; accelerated growth in Impella RP post PMA approval and approximately $10 million in revenue from Japan. The business continues to expand rapidly, and our growth rates are in line with our 5-year vision outlined back in 2015. We will continue with our patients-first sustainable growth model.
I would also like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year as we typically do when issuing guidance. In Q1, our field team was brought into headquarters for extensive annual training and also tend to take their vacations after a busy Q4. Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to summer time slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. So we expect revenue at or just under the Q1 pace. In Q3, we typically see significant sequential lift based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement.
In Q4, our March quarter, we have our best results as we end our fiscal year. Therefore, we would expect second-half revenues to represent approximately 55% of our total year.
Turning to operating margins. We expect our fiscal year 2019 margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%, showing continued leverage in progress towards our 30% plus vision. Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, while delivering improvements in operating leverage. These investments will enable us to grow via new product enhancements, including sensing technology, geographies, clinical studies and product platforms, including Impella ECP, the Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. These investments will continue to lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. As it relates to the tax rate for fiscal year 2019, we are consistent with what we communicated during our last earnings call. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-base compensation awards, we expect the full year tax rate to fall in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary, as we close out a successful 2018, we look forward to a new year of continued execution, as we build the field of heart recovery.

In this group, 25% or around 40,000 were coded for acute kidney injury, suggested of low perfusion and contrast damage. Overall mechanical support was only around 5% in the Cyrus group. Impella has been recently showing a protective kidney function, and lower ejection fractions, undergoing PCI. Is this an angle that the company is exploring with new perspective evidence development?"

Impella also significantly reduced the risk of dialysis, which is, increases mortality, length of stay and cost. So the answer is, yes. We do have more extensive research that will be coming out over the next 2 to 3 years. And what we believe is happening, is the forward flow driving more blood flow to the kidneys, has a hormonal benefit, it increases urine production and it allows the kidneys to remove impurities in the blood. One of the Achilles heels of all of PCI and now also TAVR is acute kidney injury, because of the contrast, because of the stress to the heart and what the kidneys can do is sometimes shut down. So you'll be seeing, over the next 3 years, a lot of publications around the research, the basic science, but also you'll be seeing this in patients and studies that are happening both in Europe and the U.S. in the future."

So first on new EF. The patient population, if there are already surgical turndown and they have everything I described about comorbidities or complex anatomy or severe coronary disease, they don't have the option to go to surgery if something goes wrong. And we do think it will have an impact, and I think it will have an impact also in identifying patients that just do better with hemodynamic support. So it allows them to do longer inflations, potentially atherectomy, potentially reduce acute kidney injury, so we do think it will have an impact, and we're watching it as it goes out and it takes time for this information to filter. The second question on the reimbursement. What's happened is, CMS has now created a dedicated code for percutaneous heart pumps, it is now cath lab only patients as well as the ICU emergency patients, are all in DRG 215. They maintained the focus on biventricular support and they also gave -- permanently created a DRG for biventricular Impella. So we think the simplicity of having everything together will be beneficial, but we'll watch it and make sure that we have appropriate use and appropriate reimbursement. When they do the analysis, that is being proposed and potentially can take effect next October. They are usually looking at a subset of data that's 2 years old, and that data may or may not have the most recent trends of more emergency patients than elective patients. But the nice thing about the process is one, if a hospital gets better outcomes

ensure that the hospitals can do the right things for the patient, and have a win-win for both the system itself with heart recovery, but also for patients that they can avoid having to go down the cascade of more surgeries and potentially a transplant."

So as the balance goes, we work with it, but just to remind all our investors, 3 years ago, we were being paid at a lower rate for a mix between DRG 216 and 221, the coding was difficult, we did not have biventricular support with Impella. There essentially was no additional support, and many of the hospitals per transfer would not receive any reimbursement for patient management in explant of Impella. So we now have a dedicated system, we now have approval of essentially, an extensive array for elective urgent and emergent indications from the FDA, and now it's up to us to continue to execute and partner with our hospitals to get better outcomes."

So that's been very beneficial to have physicians come in where we go through hemodynamic science best practices. We've also seen an increase in the mix of increase in high-risk PCI. Years ago, Germany was 95% shock patients and now we have high-risk PCI growing. The third is that, it just continued reinforcement, that in Germany, the intra-aortic balloon pump is a Class III for cardiogenic shock, which means that it's harmful for patients. And then we're now active with over 200 hospitals and there are 600 to go in Germany, so we're making progress in opening new centers with our added distribution. And as we do that, we'll continue to grow both indications, but also -- we'll go deeper in new site and that drives strong growth itself. Your question on the 5.5, the answer is that it's a little bit of cannibalization, because it will replace completely the 5.0, but because it's longer-term the CE mark is for 30 days, because its peak flow is above 6 liters, it will have an optical sensor because patients can get up and ambulate. There is a lot of interest in new science of unloading, we will match the Impella use, things with stem cells or immunosuppressant drugs, but there is no question that when you put the 5.5 in a patient, it completely unloads them, their kidneys make urine, patients feel better, and they can get up and move around because it's designed for the axillary implant and it avoids the sternotomy. So we're very excited.

It's independent of Abiomed, and it's kind of a call-to-arms by physicians to enable not only the Impella, but better processes of putting the Impella in before the PCI, using a catheter to monitor the patient. And we just had a recent publication showing that the Impella CP has a even higher survival effect over the Impella 2.5.

The thesis that we're testing is not just the unloading benefits of Impella, where it takes the work demand and reduces the oxygen demand for the heart, it's the -- and there is a publication on this thesis. It's that the unloading of Impella preconditions the myocardium, so when the patient is revascularized, where they open up the blockage, that, that preconditioning of Impella will reduce the reperfusion injury that happens in the normal process and standard of care today, where they try to open the clogged artery within 90 minutes. And reperfusion injury results from that solution, because what happens is there is a process called apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, and that's why patients today that survive heart attacks, again, the average is -- the statistics are that 70% of these patients that survive their first heart attack will suffer from heart failure in 5 years. So we think that this has really a huge impact in looking at the way STEMI patients are treated. If it is not successful, it does not change the fact that Impella is proven to reduce the oxygen demand, it doesn't -- it's been proven to help increase coronary -- cardiac power, it reduced acute kidney injury and multiple other benefits that we've already studied with the FDA.

One note that is important, that just happened in Japan, is the Japanese Society Guidelines just came out with a classification, and they have downgraded the intra-aortic balloon pump to Class III in cardiogenic shock, which again Class III means, it's potentially harmful to patients and is not recommended. So, we're glad to see that, that guideline has been updated and we're very excited again to bring our best practices to Japan to drive native heart recovery as a standard of care. And we'll give more updates as we go, but again, we think that the Japan is the second largest market opportunity in the world and is custom designed to our mission of recovering hearts."

If you're looking at interventional cardiologist, where that's our primary user, I would say, we have usually 3 to 5 champions at each center, 60% sounds a little high to me, relative to how many interventional cardiologists are there, and we're seeing that broadly increase, as we're doing training centers and programs on access and closure. There's a lot of physicians that are a little bit nervous to close a 12-French or 14-French hole. So, I would say, it's not 60% for interventional cardiologists yet. You also have multiple indications, so you may have an interventional cardiologist using it for high-risk PCI, but not for shock or vice versa. For surgeons, we have only penetrated about half the market with the 5.0, so the 5.0 has got a long way to go and again, we think the 5.5 will replace that and we'll be at all 1,000 heart hospitals in the U.S. alone. In the RP we're only 19% penetrated in the install base. So we have essentially, many years ahead of new doctors, new indications and new products into all the existing U.S. hospitals in our current install base. So we're very excited, but again as we train people, we train to get the best outcomes both for high-risk PCI and for cardiogenic shock."

In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan.

In Q4 Abiomed achieved record results and continued adoption of the Impella product portfolio in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We closed the fiscal year with strong momentum, and revenue growth of 40% to $174 million. For the full fiscal year 2018, Abiomed generated $594 million in revenue, with growth of 33%, and operating income at $157 million with growth of 74% year-over-year. This year, Abiomed marked several significant milestones, and I am proud of our patients-first execution and operational discipline from research to manufacturing to customer support. We earned multiple global regulatory approvals in the U.S., Germany and Japan on new products, new indications and reimbursement.
For today's call, I will cover growth in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock and briefly discuss fiscal '19 expansion with new products, geographies and clinical studies. Q4 success was driven by U.S. patient utilization growth at 35% with Protected PCI in emergent patients at 26% and 43%, respectively. We set new overall U.S. utilization records for every category, best quarter, month, week and day for both Protected PCI and emergent usage. 
Impella RP also delivered solid results in our second full quarter since the commercial launch with 48 new U.S. sites, and growth of 93% in patients and 154% in revenue. However, Impella adoption is a function of training, data and time. And as a result, we are still in the early innings with the penetration rate of approximately 9% of 231,000 patients in the U.S. alone. To elucidate this adoption process, I would like to share 2 patient stories.
Mr. Martin Smiley, 77 years old, had bypass surgery in 1989 and more recently began experiencing severe shortness of breath, leaving him unable to walk a few feet without feeling completely fatigued. A primary care physician eventually referred him to a cardiologist at Park West Hospital in Tennessee. Fortunately, Park West Hospital has a protected PCI coordinator that educates the community on high-risk PCI and identifies appropriate patients that are often turned down for cardiac surgery. The hospital's Protected PCI coordinator reviewed Mr. Smiley's clinical history and scheduled him for a consultation with Dr. Ayaz Rahman. On the day of the procedure, Mr. Smiley's heart was failing, and the PCI was performed with Impella CP support during the placement of multiple coronary stents. The procedure went smoothly and Impella was removed. Mr. Smiley was discharged home to his family, and his ejection fraction, a measure of the heart pump power, improved after the procedure. The improvement in ejection fraction is a significant driver of improved quality of life, cost savings and is a unique and validated benefit of Protected PCI. As a result, Mr. Smiley is now back at work, helping customers at Lowes.
My second patient story is about cardiogenic shock. Last November, former governor, Tom Ridge, now 72 years old, suffered a massive heart attack while attending a conference in Texas and received CPR at the hotel and in the ambulance for about 30 minutes. Governor Ridge arrived at the hospital in dire circumstances and was rushed directly to the cath lab. Upon arrival, the interventional cardiologists immediately and simultaneously inserted the Impella CP and opened up the blockage. After 4 days in the ICU, with Impella unloading his heart and supporting his vital organs, the device was explanted. He was later discharged with his native heart, and in improved ejection fraction and returned home.
This past February, I visited the governor in DC, where he was back at work and functioning without the need for an implantable LVAD or heart transplant. From a CMS population perspective, most patients above 65 years old are not candidates for heart transplant and prioritize heart recovery above all other treatment options, based on quality of life and cost. We believe our continued focus on best-practice protocols are driving improved clinical outcomes and adoption. To date, we estimate 200 hospitals have these multidisciplinary shock algorithms, 30 hospitals in 18 cities had joined the independent National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, and we are in the process of converting 40 hospitals in our cVAD Registry to the protocol. The advanced heart hospitals and dedicated physicians are combining our Impella products with improved processes to help patients like Mr. Smiley and Governor Ridge, not only survive, but avoid the cascade of the most invasive and expensive therapies, because they returned to life with their native hearts.
Over the years, the FDA and CMF -- CMS have reviewed our clinical data and cost-effectiveness research and have expanded our existing FDA, PMA labels and allocated a dedicated MS-DRG for percutaneous heart pumps. 
For highest PCI, our new label now accounts for patients with complex anatomy, severe coronary artery disease and comorbidities with or without reduced ejection fraction. Data supporting this expansion included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients from the cVAD Registry study. The majority of patients were older, more often female, had more hypertension with more lesions treated, including left main and were turned down for open-heart surgery due to risk factors. The data showed that high-risk PCI with Impella support was feasible, safe and achieved favorable outcomes for these patients. This combined patient experience was published in March 2018, in the American Journal of Cardiology, studying 891 patients.
The FDA also expanded our PMA approval for cardiogenic shock, resulting from cardiomyopathy, which incorporates peripartum, postpartum cardiomyopathy, SCAD and myocarditis. Abiomed submitted analysis from 93 patients in the cVAD Registry study and a comprehensive literature review, including 109 patients treated with Impella. 
Both FDA expansions reinforced prior FDA studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness of Impella support in the elective, urgent and emergent patient populations. While we remain focused on the 231,000 U.S high-risk patient population, we acknowledge that these additional indications expand our addressable market and enable a wider range of patients in the future. We also anticipate steady adoption in both Germany and Japan for 25,000 and 50,000 patients respectively. In Germany, we grew 95% in Q4 and 70% for the year. In Japan, we exceeded our fiscal '18 goal and expect to add $10 million in revenue in fiscal '19 under a controlled launch.
Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to some new pipeline opportunities. In Q4, Abiomed received European CE Mark approval for the Impella 5.5 pump and treated our first set of patients in Germany. The Impella 5.5 is a heart recovery pump, because it provides physicians a minimally invasive, 30-day, ambulatory, weanable, forward flow, unloading heart device with peak flows above 6 liters. The device is also designed for a 60-minute axillary implant that avoids a sternotomy. While not yet approved in the U.S., we expect the Impella 5.5 to further enhance Abiomed's product portfolio, and significantly advance the field of heart recovery, for both chronic and acute patients requiring longer-term hemodynamic support.
For our STEMI DTU FDA feasibility study, we are somewhat ahead of schedule and enrollment is near-complete with 46 of the 50 patients randomized. Therefore, we anticipate earlier completion of enrollment by mid- to late summer versus October.
We are excited to test our hypothesis that unloading with Impella before revascularization may reduce reperfusion injury in the setting of acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock. We look forward to analyzing the feasibility clinical data and, if successful, designing the larger pivotal randomized controlled trial.
In closing, we enter fiscal '19 with purpose and confidence in our mission to recover hearts and save lives. We finished the year achieving records on nearly every clinical and business metric and fortified our leadership position with expanded distribution, training facilities, manufacturing capacity, 317 patents, 311 patents pending and $400 million in cash. Fiscal 2019 is positioned to be another outstanding year, and we appreciate the investment from our shareholders. I'm also grateful to the dedicated employees and customers that have enabled us to serve our patient and achieve our corporate goals around heart recovery. 
I would now like to officially welcome and introduce our new CFO, Todd Trapp. We are extremely pleased to have Todd on the team and know he will further improve our execution in the future."

And before I get started, I just want to say, that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholders on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future.

And before I get started, I just want to say, that I'm really excited to be part of the Abiomed team, and I look forward to meeting the stakeholders on the phone and in person and working closely with you in the future. 
So now let's get into the financial results. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $174 million, an increase of $50 million or 40% versus last year. U.S. Impella revenue rose 35% to $146 million, driven by a 35% increase in patient utilization. Outside the U.S., Impella revenue totaled $22 million and was up 107%, mainly driven by our performance in Germany. In the quarter, our German revenue increased 95% versus last year, due to continued patient utilization and a greater adoption associated with high-risk PCI. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year. In the U.S., at the end of fiscal year 2018, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at 1,197 and 1,172 sites of the targeted 1,400 hospitals. Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 516 and 270 sites, respectfully. Both the 5.0 and RP are now being adopted by more sites and have significant runway.
Reorder performance continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorders increased 35% to $140 million versus prior year, which translated into our reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP, rose slightly to 3.8 units per site, versus 3.7 in the prior quarter and 3.4 units per site in the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 82.7% compared to 84.6% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to higher manufacturing investments to support future top line growth as well as geographic mix. Our D&E expense for the fourth quarter totaled $21 million, a 31% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was related to investments in new products, including enhancements and higher clinical costs related to STEMI and cVAD Registry studies.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter totaled $76 million, an increase of $15 million or 26% versus prior year. Incremental investments to expand our industry-leading U.S. commercial team and to support the Japanese commercial launch were the main drivers of the increase.
Operating income grew 64% to $48 million in Q4. This translated into an operating margin of 27.3%, an increase of 400 basis points versus prior year. The strong margin expansion was due to higher patient volume and continued operating discipline, which confirms the leverage in our business model.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $37 million or $0.80 per diluted share versus $0.33 in Q4 of '17. The year-over-year net income increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and excess tax benefits associated with our equity awards.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. In the quarter, we generated $49 million of cash from operating activities. As a result, we ended the year with $400 million of cash. Our top priority for deployment continues to be supporting organic growth initiatives, including building on our intellectual property advantage.
Now, I'll make a few comments on our record-setting fiscal 2018. For the year, we delivered revenue of $594 million, an increase of 33% or $149 million versus prior year. We saw broad-based growth in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. due to continued adoption of the entire Impella platform. For the year, operating income was $157 million, up 74% compared to the prior year. We delivered operating margins of 26.5%, while continuing to make the necessary investments to support our future growth initiatives. GAAP net income for the year was $112 million or $2.45 per diluted share versus $52 million or $1.17 in the prior year. The 100-plus percent increase was again driven by strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate.
Finally, we increased our cash position by $123 million during the year, while investing in our infrastructure, and manufacturing capacity and we remain debt free. 
Lastly, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2019. As noted in the earnings release, we expect 2019 revenue to be in the range of $740 million to $770 million, which translates to 25% to 30% growth for the year. The guidance is based on the following assumptions: continued penetration of the existing and expanded markets for Protected PCI in cardiogenic shock; accelerated growth in Impella RP post-PMA approval and approximately $10 million in revenue from Japan. The business continues to expand rapidly, and our growth rates are in line with our 5-year vision outlined back in 2015. We will continue with our patients-first sustainable growth model.
I would also like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year as we typically do when issuing guidance. In Q1, our field team was brought into headquarters for extensive annual training and also tend to take their vacations after a busy Q4. Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. So we expect revenue at or just under the Q1 pace. In Q3, we typically see significant sequential lift based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement.
In Q4, our March quarter, we have our best results as we end our fiscal year. Therefore, we would expect second-half revenues to represent approximately 55% of our total year.
Turning to operating margins. We expect our fiscal year 2019 margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%, showing continued leverage in progress towards our 30% plus vision. Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology while delivering improvements in operating leverage. These investments will enable us to grow via new product enhancements, including sensing technology, geographies, clinical studies and product platforms, including Impella ECP, the Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. These investments will continue to lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. As it relates to the tax rate for fiscal year 2019, we are consistent with what we communicated during our last earnings call. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards, we expect the full year tax rate to fall in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary, as we close out a successful 2018, we look forward to a new year of continued execution, as we build the field of heart recovery.

In this group, 25% or around 40,000 were coded for acute kidney injury, suggested of low perfusion and contrast damage. Overall mechanical support was only around 5% in the Cyrus group. Impella has been recently showing a protective kidney function, and lower ejection fractions, undergoing PCI. Is this an angle that the company is exploring with new perspective evidence development?"

Impella also significantly reduced the risk of dialysis, which is, increases mortality, length of stay and cost. So the answer is, yes. We do have more extensive research that will be coming out over the next 2 to 3 years. And what we believe is happening, is the forward flow driving more blood flow to the kidneys, has a hormonal benefit, it increases urine production and it allows the kidneys to remove impurities in the blood. One of the Achilles heels of all of PCI and now also TAVR is acute kidney injury, because of the contrast, because of the stress to the heart and what the kidneys can do is sometimes shut down. So you'll be seeing, over the next 3 years, a lot of publications around the research, the basic science, but also you'll be seeing this in patients and studies that are happening both in Europe and the U.S. in the future."

The patient population, if there are already surgical turndown and they have everything I described about comorbidities or complex anatomy or severe coronary disease, they don't have the option to go to surgery if something goes wrong. And we do think it will have an impact, and I think it will have an impact also in identifying patients that just do better with hemodynamic support. So it allows them to do longer inflations, potentially atherectomy, potentially reduce acute kidney injury, so we do think it will have an impact, and we're watching it as it goes out and it takes time for this information to filter. The second question on the reimbursement. What's happened is, CMS has now created a dedicated code for percutaneous heart pumps, it is now cath lab only patients as well as the ICU emergency patients, are all in DRG 215. They maintained the focus on biventricular support and they also gave -- permanently created a DRG for biventricular Impella. So we think the simplicity of having everything together will be beneficial, but we'll watch it and make sure that we have appropriate use and appropriate reimbursement. When they do the analysis, that is being proposed and potentially can take effect next October. They are usually looking at a subset of data that's 2 years old, and that data may or may not have the most recent trends of more emergency patients than elective patients. But the nice thing about the process is one, if a hospital gets better outcomes

ensure that the hospitals can do the right things for the patient, and have a win-win for both the system itself with heart recovery, but also for patients that they can avoid having to go down the cascade of more surgeries and potentially a transplant."

So as the balance goes, we work with it, but just to remind all our investors, 3 years ago, we were being paid at a lower rate for a mix between DRG 216 and 221, the coding was difficult, we did not have biventricular support with Impella. There essentially was no additional support, and many of the hospitals per transfer would not receive any reimbursement for patient management in explant of Impella. So we now have a dedicated system, we now have approval of essentially, an extensive array for elective urgent and emergent indications from the FDA, and now it's up to us to continue to execute and partner with our hospitals to get better outcomes."

So the growth in Germany is a function of ausbildung, daten and zeit, which is training, data and time in German. And it's -- what's happening is, as you mentioned, we grew 95% in the quarter, you have a couple of factors. One is we've been adding to the distribution, and we have a training center now in Aachen, Germany. So that's been very beneficial to have physicians come in where we go through hemodynamic science best practices. We've also seen an increase in the mix of increase in high-risk PCI. Years ago, Germany was 95% shock patients and now we have high-risk PCI growing. The third is that it just continued reinforcement, that in Germany, the intra-aortic balloon pump is a Class III for cardiogenic shock, which means that it's harmful for patients. And then we're now active with over 200 hospitals and there are 600 to go in Germany, so we're making progress in opening new centers with our added distribution. And as we do that, we'll continue to grow both indications, but also -- we'll go deeper in new site and that drives strong growth itself. Your question on the 5.5, the answer is that it's a little bit of cannibalization, because it will replace completely the 5.0, but because it's longer term the CE mark is for 30 days, because its peak flow is above 6 liters, it will have an optical sensor because patients can get up and ambulate. There is a lot of interest in new science of unloading, we will match the Impella use, things with stem cells or immunosuppressant drugs, but there is no question that when you put the 5.5 in a patient, it completely unloads them, their kidneys make urine, patients feel better, and they can get up and move around because it's designed for the axillary implant and it avoids the sternotomy. So we're very excited. We're going to go slow and steady, we're going to collect data to publish, and we're going to work with the FDA early so they understand how this product will replace the Impella 5.0."

One of the things that's very rewarding for us is the Detroit CSI program, Cardiogenic Shock Initiative is now national. It's independent of Abiomed, and it's kind of a call-to-arms by physicians to enable not only the Impella, but better processes of putting the Impella in before the PCI, using a catheter to monitor the patient. And we just had a recent publication showing that the Impella CP has a even higher survival effect over the Impella 2.5. So there is lots of information in there, we love seeing the improvement in outcomes. And we really enjoy meeting these patients and seeing them having the ability to go home with their own hearts.

The current DTU study are patients that are not having cardiogenic shock, so we do not treat any of them today. The thesis that we're testing is not just the unloading benefits of Impella, where it takes the work demand and reduces the oxygen demand for the heart, it's the -- and there is a publication on this thesis. It's that the unloading of Impella preconditions the myocardium, so when the patient is revascularized, where they open up the blockage, that, that preconditioning of Impella will reduce the reperfusion injury that happens in the normal process and standard of care today, where they try to open the clogged artery within 90 minutes. And reperfusion injury results from that solution, because what happens is there is a process called apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, and that's why patients today that survive heart attacks, again, the average is -- the statistics are that 70% of these patients that survive their first heart attack will suffer from heart failure in 5 years. So we think that this has really a huge impact in looking at the way STEMI patients are treated. If it is not successful, it does not change the fact that Impella is proven to reduce the oxygen demand, it doesn't -- it's been proven to help increase coronary -- cardiac power, it reduced acute kidney injury and multiple other benefits that we've already studied with the FDA. What's unique about this again though is, it's new science on what unloading does in preconditioning and helping to reduce reperfusion injury."

There's a lot of physicians that are a little bit nervous to close a 12-French or 14-French hole. So, I would say, it's not 60% for interventional cardiologists yet. You also have multiple indications, so you may have an interventional cardiologist using it for high-risk PCI, but not for shock or vice versa. For surgeons, we have only penetrated about half the market with the 5.0, so the 5.0 has got a long way to go and again, we think the 5.5 will replace that and we'll be at all 1,000 heart hospitals in the U.S. alone.

U.S. patient utilization increased by 30% and was driven by Impella",1136,"Thanks, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. Abiomed reported a strong start to our fiscal year of '19. In Q1, we delivered another record in revenue of $180 million, up 36% versus prior year. U.S. patient utilization increased by 30% and was driven by Impella adoption in the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications, which grew 24% and 37%, respectively. 
European revenue increased 53%, German revenue up 42%. In our first Q1, in Japan, Impella grew favorably and contributed $2.6 million in revenue. Abiomed is committed to sustainable growth and improving outcomes each quarter. We do this through advanced training, product enhancements and sharing of best practices derived from real-world experience. 
We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and increased manufacturing capacity, while expanding Impella adoption with new products, new indications and new geographies. 
In Q1, we also completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study. I'm proud of the entire teams continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives. 
For today's call, I would like to highlight 2 topics: first, on our training and education to drive adoption and improve clinical outcomes; and second, I will provide an update on key strategic initiatives around Japan and our FDA study. 
To start, the adoption of Impella is a function of training, data and time. This quarter, we maximized our resources in training and education across the globe and set new records for physician and employee engagement. We trained more internal people in Q1 than ever before, with nearly 500 employees at our commercial kickoff meeting and added 52 new global employees, including 14 people in the U.S. commercial distribution. 
Training first this quarter include hosting our first German Impella RP course, our first Tokyo heart recovery hemodynamic course and our first Women's Initiative Heart Recovery Advisory Board meeting. We educated over 750 physicians through on-site training, symposia where headquarters collaboration at our heart recovery institutes in Danvers, Massachusetts Germany. 
Additionally, we trained 28 Protected PCI coordinators, and there are now approximately 60 hospitals with a dedicated role. Protected PCI coordinators will help identify appropriate patients, facilitate heart team collaboration and conduct outreach programs to help find undertreated, advanced coronary artery disease patients in the community. We believe our focus and investment on training will translate to increase Impella adoption and improved patient outcomes. Increased patient survival with native heart recovery not only allows for improved ejection fraction and quality of life for our patients, but also lowers overall health care costs. 
Our recent patient story reinforces this concept. Eric Braga, an active 47-year-old father and husband, began feeling shortness of breath and chest pain while playing laser tag with his kids. After his wife drove into the emergency room at Community Medical Center in Fresno, California, Eric collapsed and coded at the entrance. The hospital staff performed CPR and shocked Eric multiple times. 
A catheterization confirmed a 100% occlusion in the LAD artery, a major source of blood flow to the left ventricle of the heart. Dr. Michael Jen implanted the Impella CP to provide Eric's heart hemodynamic support and placed stents to open the blocked artery. After 2 days of support, Eric star recovered, and the Impella pump was weaned and removed. Today, after 6 months, Eric's heart function has returned to normal with an EF of 65%, and he continues to enjoy active life with his wife and 3 children. Eric's story highlights the clinical benefit of percutaneous cost-effective solutions that promote both survival and native heart recovery. 
We continue to build our library of clinical data and cost-effectiveness studies for patients like Eric. This quarter, the American Heart Journal published survival data on 15,259 AMI cardiogenic shock patients and the Impella quality and assurance database, what we call the IQ. 
analysis revealed that survival was a function of best practices such as Impella as a first support strategy, hemodynamic monitoring and Impella experience with implantation volume. This paper confirms the 70%-plus survival rates we see at top Impella sites with cardiogenic shock protocols that require Impella be implanted pre-PCI. 
As evidenced by this publication, real-world data is being accepted and published by the clinical community. It is exciting to see independent physician-led initiatives like the National CSI improving awareness and impacting survival in heart recovery around the U.S. 
Turning to outside the U.S. In June, I visited Japan with several members of our senior management team. In Japan, we opened 8 new sites in Q1 and are on track to have 45 sites by the end of the fiscal year. 
As of July, 131 hospitals have downloaded the Impella application. 71 are currently approved by the government committee, and we have opened a total of 21 Japanese sites today. Our first hemodynamic course in Tokyo was a great success with nearly 100 physicians in attendance, representing both interventional cardiology and heart surgery. 
I also have the opportunity to visit multiple hospitals, and it remains clear that the Japanese physician community both appreciates and understands the clinical need for hemodynamic support and native heart recovery. 
Additionally, we've been in new countries over the last year. And we've treated patients in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Israel and most recently in India. 
To be clear, U.S., Germany and Japan remain our priority, but we are moving forward with heart recovery centers of excellence in select hospitals in specific countries. 
Moving to our regulatory progress. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment for FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study ahead of schedule in mid-June. We've reviewed the data and are working with the FDA to establish a time line for submission and analysis of the results. As a company protocol, we do not publish or submit abstracts until the FDA has had the opportunity to review our studies. We anticipate more dialogue with the FDA and the steward community on next steps in August. 
As a result, we are targeting November for publication and release at the American Heart Association Conference. 
In closing, we are on track to create the field of heart recovery as we penetrate the U.S. market and become the global standard of care overtime. 
We believe our focus on sustainable growth with improving clinical outcomes will enable us to remain one of the fastest-growing companies with a strong balance sheet and extensive intellectual property portfolio. 
After Q1, we are well positioned for success in fiscal '19 and currently focused on execution in Q2. 
I would like to thank our customers for their commitment to advancing the standard of care and recognize our shareholders for their investment. The secret of our success and execution remains our commitment to our purpose of recovering hearts and patients first values within our culture. 
I will now turn the call over to Todd."
247589,573240547,1508822,"ABIOMED, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Abiomed, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million or 36% versus last year with performance across all geographies. U.S. Impella revenue rose 32% to $152 million, driven by a 30",813,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million or 36% versus last year with performance across all geographies. U.S. Impella revenue rose 32% to $152 million, driven by a 30% increase in patient utilization. 
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $22 million and was up 75% versus last year due to the continuous strength in Germany, we saw revenues increased 42% and our Japanese launch. We are pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan where revenue totaled $2.6 million for the quarter as we opened up 8 new sites. 
Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year. In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q1, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at roughly 1,200 sites. 
Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 540 and 320 sites, respectively. We expect to see continued demand to the 5.0 and RP in the coming quarters. 
Reorder performance also continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorder revenue was $145 million, which translated into a reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP rose slightly from 3.8 units per site to 4.0 during the quarter. Gross margin in Q1 was 82.9% compared to 83.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to product and geographic mix as well as incremental manufacturing investments to support our future growth object initiatives. 
R&D expense for the first quarter was $21 million, a 26% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was driven by investments through new products and enhancements such as smart assist, Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as clinical cost for the STEMI trial and cVAD Registry studies. 
Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, which will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $81 million, an increase of $21 million or 34% versus prior year. The variance was due to additional training programs, incentive compensation, our Japanese launch and the expansion of our industry-leading commercial team. We will continue to make these investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration. 
Operating income grew 41% to $47 million in the quarter, which translated to an operating margin of 26%. The 26% was a Q1 record for the company. Our margin expansion of 100 basis points was due to higher volume, which more than offset our growth investments. 
We are on track to invest in our training and educational programs as well as to add commercial employees at a faster pace in the first half of this year. We believe the early investment will be advantageous as we had in the second half of 2019. 
GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million or $1.95 per share, up 141% versus Q1 of '18. The company saw a benefit of $54 million or $1.17 per share of excess tax benefits relating to employee share-based compensation awards, which are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense. 
We expect excess tax benefits to have a largest impact on the first quarter given our investing schedule, and we will likely see smaller adjustments in the final 3 quarters of the year. 
Our balance sheet remains debt free, and we ended the quarter with $367 million of cash and marketable securities. Our standard practice is to use cash to pay employee withholding taxes when instead of settling shares in the market. 
As a result, in Q1, we utilized $68 million of cash to reduce dilution from stock compensation. Our top priority for cash remains support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage. Before turning to full year guidance, I would like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year. 
Q2 is, typically, a slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the catheterization labs and physician vacations. As a result, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below Q1. 
With that said, given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by 2 points or $15 million and expect revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year. 
In summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies, while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for the remainder of the fiscal year 2019 and beyond. 
Sonia, please now open the line for questions."

So the first question was on India and the So as I'm commented in my prepared remarks, we are planting seeds outside the U.S., but our main focus is still the U.S. Germany and japan. That's our priority. There are centers of excellence out there in certain countries. There is interest, and we will continue to work with those sites to help drive a relationship with the government to establish reimbursement as for heart therapy -- for heart recovery. So this is a new concept. And that's what Germany has recognized. The U.S. FDA has recognized and what Japan has recognized. And so where we find partners and we work with the governments to bring this technology together. The best way to do that is to have the right keeping new leaders and researchers within the country. This matches the way we entered other parts of Europe. And we'll continue to follow that formula. On your question on STEMI, the study was a safety and feasibility study because the concept was somewhat radical that we were asking people to precondition the left ventricle, which means that they were unloading for 30 minutes before opening up the blockage. That's something that isn't on today. We're not recommending a commercial in any way. It is a study that we can utilize to then get to a pivotal because we think that there's 2 benefits of unloading. One benefit is preconditioning the myocardium before revascularization because we think it creates a cascade of events that reduces the apoptosis process, which means they can keep the heart muscle from dying or risking the infarct size. And then the second benefit is unloading during the procedure and after what we've done and what we've proven is that it does unload, it does reduce the oxygen demand and work on the myocardium. So those two things were in play. We've always intended to go to a pivotal, but as I mentioned, we do have a strict policy that we don't talk about our studies until the FDA has a chance to review it. There's also the academic integrity of the information before it will be announced, it has to be kept confidential. And we are excited to continue to advance the science. One thing I would reference or not for investors if they want to understand a bit more about the solid science behind this, there's a publication that just came out  in It's called the left ventricle our unloading before reperfusion promotes functional recovery after acute myocardial infarction. And Dr. Kapoor is one of the lead author. So it does explain a lot of what you're asking about is what will people be most excited about. But certainly, what we're trying to do is prevent heart failure for patients that have heart attacks, leave the hospital alive, but within 5 years, 70% of heart failure. So that's more to come on that as a publication information gets released."

And then the long-term benefits, unfortunately, for the patients is they do take effect starting in the first year with 25% going into heart failure. And obviously, they're very in 5-year. So we think there's things you can see. There's also if you -- per the paper I referenced, it does talk about some of the things you can test around the expression of genes associated with the cardioprotective response in the heart. So there's other ways to look at and analyze what's happening when you're unloading a patient that has a large infarct area.

And so that's not only one of the most significant outcomes we can produce for a patient, but it's probably one of the highest cost savings that exist in all of As you're talking about patients that there are not going to die immediately, they die organ at a time and then they die overtime with multiple surgeries, potentially implantable devices, followed by a transplant if they're capable, followed by all over, again, within 5 to 10 years based on the response to the autoimmune therapies. So this is a profound change in the standard of care. The more signs that comes out around unloading and the benefits and the more people see that these protocols, these best practices can have an impact, the more I think it will be demanded by the communities out there."

But also, in Germany, there's a lot of interest in reduction of the inflammatory response. And some of these patients may be treated with auto immune suppression drugs. There is research that has been out, and there's more to come showing that by unloading the left ventricle, you can reduce that inflammatory response. And there's a lot of physicians that are looking at research of providing an extended period of unloading, which can have the ability to, again, have some recovery. There's also another paper that just came out our Journal of the American College of Cardiology and the main author is Dr.  who is a heart failure cardiologist in Chicago.

In Q1, we delivered another record in revenue of $180 million, up 36% versus prior year. U.S. patient utilization increased by 30% and was driven by Impella adoption in the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications, which grew 24% and 37%, respectively.
European revenue increased 53%, with German revenue up 42%. In our first Q1, in Japan, Impella grew favorably and contributed $2.6 million in revenue. Abiomed is committed to sustainable growth and improving outcomes each quarter. We do this through advanced training, product enhancements and sharing of best practices derived from real-world experience.
We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and increased manufacturing capacity while expanding Impella adoption with new products, new indications and new geographies.
In Q1, we also completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study. I'm proud of the entire team's continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives.
For today's call, I would like to highlight 2 topics: first, on our training and education to drive adoption and improve clinical outcomes; and second, I will provide an update on key strategic initiatives around Japan and our FDA study.
To start, the adoption of Impella is a function of training, data and time. This quarter, we maximized our resources in training and education across the globe and set new records for physician and employee engagement. We trained more internal people in Q1 than ever before, with nearly 500 employees at our commercial kickoff meeting and added 52 new global employees, including 14 people in the U.S. commercial distribution. Training first this quarter include hosting our first German Impella RP course, our first Tokyo heart recovery hemodynamic course and our first Women's Initiative Heart Recovery Advisory Board meeting. We educated over 750 physicians through on-site training, symposia or headquarters collaboration at our heart recovery institutes in Danvers, Massachusetts; and Aachen, Germany.
Additionally, we trained 28 Protected PCI coordinators, and there are now approximately 60 hospitals with a dedicated role. Protected PCI coordinators will help identify appropriate patients, facilitate heart team collaboration and conduct outreach programs to help find undertreated, advanced coronary artery disease patients in the community. We believe our focus and investment on training will translate to increased Impella adoption and improved patient outcomes. Increased patient survival with native heart recovery not only allows for improved ejection fraction and quality of life for our patients, but also lowers overall health care costs.
A recent patient story reinforces this concept. Eric Braga, an active 47-year-old father and husband, began feeling shortness of breath and chest pain while playing laser tag with his kids. After his wife drove him to the emergency room at Clovis Community Medical Center in Fresno, California, Eric collapsed and coded at the entrance. The hospital staff performed CPR and shocked Eric multiple times. A catheterization confirmed 100% occlusion in the LAD artery, a major source of blood flow to the left ventricle of the heart. Dr. Michael Gen implanted the Impella CP to provide Eric's heart hemodynamic support and placed stents to open the blocked artery. After 2 days of support, Eric recovered, and the Impella pump was weaned and removed. Today, after 6 months, Eric's heart function has returned to normal, with an EF of 65%, and he continues to enjoy an active life with his wife and 3 children. Eric's story highlights the clinical benefit of percutaneous cost-effective solutions that promote both survival and a native heart recovery.
We continue to build our library of clinical data and cost-effectiveness studies for patients like Eric. This quarter, the American Heart Journal published survival data on 15,259 AMI cardiogenic shock patients in the Impella quality and assurance database, what we call the IQ.
Multivariate analysis revealed that survival was a function of best practices, such as Impella as a first support strategy, hemodynamic monitoring and Impella experience with implantation volume. This paper confirms the 70%-plus survival rates we see at top Impella sites, with cardiogenic shock protocols that require Impella be implanted pre-PCI. As evidenced by this publication, real-world data is being accepted and published by the clinical community. It is exciting to see independent physician-led initiatives like the National CSI, improving awareness and impacting survival and heart recovery around the U.S.
Turning to outside the U.S. In June, I visited Japan with several members of our senior management team. In Japan, we opened 8 new sites in Q1 and are on track to have 45 sites by the end of the fiscal year. As of July, 131 hospitals have downloaded the Impella application. 71 are currently approved by the government committee, and we have opened a total of 21 Japanese sites to date. Our first hemodynamic course in Tokyo was a great success, with nearly 100 physicians in attendance, representing both interventional cardiology and heart surgery.
I also had the opportunity to visit multiple hospitals, and it remains clear that the Japanese physician community both appreciates and understands the clinical need for hemodynamic support and native heart recovery.
Additionally, we've been planting the seeds in new countries over the last year, and we've treated patients in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Israel and, most recently, in India. 
To be clear, U.S., Germany and Japan remain our priority, but we are moving forward with heart recovery centers of excellence in select hospitals in specific countries.
Moving to our regulatory progress. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment for FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study ahead of schedule in mid-June. We've reviewed the data and are working with the FDA to establish a time line for submission and analysis of the results. As a company protocol, we do not publish or submit abstracts until the FDA has had the opportunity to review our studies. We anticipate more dialogue with the FDA and the steering community on next steps in August. As a result, we are targeting November for publication and release at the American Heart Association conference.
In closing, we are on track to create the field of heart recovery as we penetrate the U.S. market and become the global standard of care over time. We believe our focus on sustainable growth with improving clinical outcomes will enable us to remain one of the fastest-growing GAAP-profitable medtech companies, with a strong balance sheet and extensive intellectual property portfolio. After Q1, we are well positioned for success in fiscal '19 and currently focused on execution in Q2. I would like to thank our customers for their commitment to advancing the standard of care and recognize our shareholders for their investment. The secret of our success and execution remains our commitment to our purpose of recovering hearts and patients' first values within our culture.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."
247589,573240547,1509132,"ABIOMED, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Abiomed, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.

In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million, or 36%, versus last year, with performance across all geographies. U.S. Impella revenue rose 32% to $152 million, driven by a 30% increase in patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $22 million and was up 75% versus last year due to the continuous strength in Germany, which saw revenues increase 42% and our Japanese launch. We are pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan where revenue totaled $2.6 million for the quarter as we opened up 8 new sites. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q1, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at roughly 1,200 sites.  Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 540 and 320 sites, respectively. We expect to see continued demand for the 5.0 and RP in the coming quarters.
Reorder performance also continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorder revenue was $145 million, which translated into a reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP rose slightly from 3.8 units per site to 4.0 during the quarter.
Gross margin in Q1 was 82.9% compared to 83.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to product and geographic mix as well as incremental manufacturing investments to support our future growth object -- initiatives. 
R&D expense for the first quarter was $21 million, a 26% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was driven by investments for new products and enhancements, such as smart assist, Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as clinical cost for the STEMI trial and cVAD Registry studies. 
Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, which will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth.
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $81 million, an increase of $21 million, or 34%, versus prior year. The variance was due to additional training programs, incentive compensation, our Japanese launch and the expansion of our industry-leading commercial team. We will continue to make these investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration.
Operating income grew 41% to $47 million in the quarter, which translated to an operating margin of 26%. The 26% was a Q1 record for the company. Our margin expansion of 100 basis points was due to higher volume, which more than offset our growth investments.
We are on track to invest in our training and educational programs as well as to add commercial employees at a faster pace in the first half of this year. We believe the early investment will be advantageous as we head into the second half of 2019.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million, or $1.95 per share, up 141% versus Q1 of '18. The company saw benefit of $54 million, or $1.17 per share, of excess tax benefits relating to employee share-based compensation awards, which are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.
We expect excess tax benefits to have the largest impact on the first quarter, given our investing schedule, and we'll likely see smaller adjustments in the final 3 quarters of the year.
Our balance sheet remains debt free, and we ended the quarter with $367 million of cash and marketable securities. Our standard practice is to use cash to pay employee withholding taxes when [indiscernible] instead of settling shares in the market. As a result, in Q1, we utilized $68 million of cash to reduce dilution from stock compensation. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Before turning to full year guidance, I'd like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the catheterization labs and physician vacations. As a result, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below Q1. With that said, given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by 2 points, or $15 million, and expect revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year.
In summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 and beyond.
Sonia, please now open the line for questions."

Our forecast this year is higher than the prior year. And I do think that we're continuing to make progress on the training data and time. So I would just want to be clear and understand the question on the numbers. On the operating margin, the operating margin is also higher than the prior Q1 where we tend to make certain investments and bring on additional heads quicker because we're trying to get people through the training cycle and get a good start for the year.

And to remind all our investors, the 5.5 is a heart recovery pump because it is minimally invasive approach. It's currently CE marked for 30 days. Patients can get up and walk around. You can wean people off the pump without having the risk of retrograde flow. It does provide pulsatility as you wean it down, and it's going to give these patients more than 6 liters of peak flow. So it's really a new type of pump that can be put in without requiring a sternotomy and coring out of the left ventricle.

We feel confident that we're there. We have 3 more quarters to go. And as we said, the following year, that would be year 2 and going into year 3., as long as we're pacing at the right approach that we're growing and getting good outcomes, we'll start to go at a much faster pace. This pattern or this process could be matched with what we've done with the Impella CP and, to some extent, what we've done with the Impella RP. So we'd like to model and, again, we're trying to launch into Japan directly so that Japanese government understands that heart recovery and unloading is a new therapy. We will be submitting for the Impella CP and the RP and then in the future the 5.5. And we want to make sure that we have a great reputation, that they trust the integrity of the company because we're thinking about Japan along the terms of the next 20 years and being the standard of care."

Just thoughts on why this country ahead of, say, other European markets? And then where your plans are for rollout in India over time? And then on  STEMI, just as we look at the -- a readout later this year, the primary outcome there is infarct size as a percent of total mass, but you have several secondary endpoints, which -- and you have 2 time frames on those endpoints, a 3- to 5-day measure and then a 30-day measure. One of those is all-cause mortality. So I'm just -- what do you think will resonate across all of those endpoints? Clearly, the primary will drive some attention, but there's a lot of secondary endpoints in there as well. So what is going to be most interesting when you get that read on STEMI?"

So as I commented in my prepared remarks, we are planting seeds outside the U.S., but our main focus is still the U.S., Germany and Japan. That's our priority. There are centers of excellence out there in certain countries. There is interest, and we will continue to work with those sites to help drive a relationship with the government to establish reimbursement as -- for heart therapy -- for heart recovery. So this is a new concept and that's what Germany has recognized, the U.S. FDA has recognized, and that's what Japan has recognized. And so where we find partners and we work with the governments to bring this technology together, the best way to do that is to have the right key opinion leaders and researchers within the country. This matches the way we entered other parts of Europe, and we'll continue to follow that formula. On your question on STEMI, the study was a safety and feasibility study because the concept was somewhat radical that we were asking people to precondition the left ventricle, which means that they were unloading for 30 minutes before opening up the blockage. That's something that isn't done today. We're not recommending a commercial in any way. It is a study that we can utilize to then get to a pivotal because we think that there's 2 benefits of unloading. One benefit is preconditioning the myocardium before revascularization because we think it creates a cascade of events that reduces the apoptosis process, which means they can keep the heart muscle from dying or risking the infarct size. And then the second benefit is unloading during the procedure and after what we've done is -- and what we've proven is that it does unload, it does reduce the oxygen demand and work on the myocardium. So those 2 things were in play. We've always intended to go to a pivotal, but as I mentioned, we do have a strict policy that we don't talk about our studies until the FDA has the chance to review it. There's also the academic integrity of the information. Before it will be announced, it has to be kept confidential. And we are excited to continue to advance the science. The one thing I would reference or note for investors if they want to understand to read more about the solid science behind this. There's a publication that just came out in JACC. It's called Left Ventricular Unloading Before Reperfusion Promotes Functional Recovery After Acute Myocardial Infarction, and Dr. Kapur is one of the lead authors. So it does explain a lot of what you're asking about is what will people be most excited about. But certainly, what we're trying to do is prevent heart failure for patients that have heart attack, leave the hospital alive, but within 5 years, 70% have heart failure. So that's more to come on that as the publication and the information gets released."

And the first benefit can be seen short term in an infarct zone with an MRI -- cardiac MRI, and you can potentially see that in 30 days. And then the long-term benefits, unfortunately, for the patients is they do take effect starting in the first year, with 25% going into heart failure and, obviously, they're very poor in 5 years. So we think there's things you can see. There's also if you -- per the paper I referenced, it does talk about some of the things you can test around the expression of genes associated with the cardioprotective response in the heart. So there's other ways to look at and analyze what's happening when you're unloading a patient that has a large infarct area. So we're excited to see the science advanced, and I -- again, to your question, I think there will be both short and longer-term signal there to show benefits to these patients."

But again, we're not talking about a 9-year-old only, and we're not talking about 1 less day in the ICU. We're talking about a young population that gets to live and go home with their own heart. And so that's not only one of the most significant outcomes we can produce for a patient, but it's probably one of the highest cost savings that exist in all the medtech because you're talking about patients that they're not going to die immediately, they die organ at a time, and then they die over time with multiple surgeries, potentially implantable devices, followed by a transplant if they're capable, followed by all over again within 5 to 10 years based on the response to the autoimmune therapy. So this is a profound change in the standard of care. The more science that comes out around unloading and the benefits and the more people see that these protocols, these best practices can have an impact, the more I think it will be demanded by the communities out there."

So from an R&D expectations, we continue to look to build the cVAD Registry's data in our IQ database. And as you know, this data has been a great foundation for us to attain expanded indications for our products as evidenced in what we saw last quarter with both high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. And we also have an exciting pipeline of new products like the 5.5 and ECP and BTR coming out.

But also, in Germany, there's a lot of interest in reduction of the inflammatory response. And some of these patients may be treated with autoimmune suppression drugs. There is research that has been out, and there's more to come, showing that by unloading the left ventricle, you can reduce that inflammatory response. And there's a lot of these physicians that are looking at research of providing an extended period of unloading, which can have the ability to, again, have some recovery. There's also another paper that just came out of the Journal of American College of Cardiology, and the main author is Dr. Nir Uriel, who is a heart failure cardiologist in Chicago, and it's on mechanical unloading in heart failures in chronic patients and also shows that the benefits of unloading can have the -- a potential -- can create a potential improvement in patients that have chronic heart failure. The sweet spot for us is to support these patients before they become Class IV, they become extremely sick, whether in heart failure and having organ failure, but there's more science, and there's a lot more work to do for this product.

In Q1, we delivered another record in revenue of $180 million, up 36% versus prior year. U.S. patient utilization increased by 30% and was driven by Impella adoption in the Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications, which grew 24% and 37%, respectively.
European revenue increased 53%, with German revenue up 42%. In our first Q1, in Japan, Impella grew favorably and contributed $2.6 million in revenue. Abiomed is committed to sustainable growth and improving outcomes each quarter. We do this through advanced training, product enhancements and sharing of best practices derived from real-world experience.
We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and increased manufacturing capacity while expanding Impella adoption with new products, new indications and new geographies.
In Q1, we also completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study. I'm proud of the entire team's continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives.
For today's call, I would like to highlight 2 topics: first, on our training and education to drive adoption and improve clinical outcomes; and second, I will provide an update on key strategic initiatives around Japan and our FDA study.
To start, the adoption of Impella is a function of training, data and time. This quarter, we maximized our resources in training and education across the globe and set new records for physician and employee engagement. We trained more internal people in Q1 than ever before, with nearly 500 employees at our commercial kickoff meeting and added 52 new global employees, including 14 people in the U.S. commercial distribution. Training first this quarter include hosting our first German Impella RP course, our first Tokyo heart recovery hemodynamic course and our first Women's Initiative Heart Recovery Advisory Board meeting. We educated over 750 physicians through on-site training, symposia or headquarters collaboration at our heart recovery institutes in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany.
Additionally, we trained 28 Protected PCI coordinators, and there are now approximately 60 hospitals with a dedicated role. Protected PCI coordinators will help identify appropriate patients, facilitate heart team collaboration and conduct outreach programs to help find undertreated, advanced coronary artery disease patients in the community. We believe our focus and investment on training will translate to increased Impella adoption and improved patient outcomes. Increased patient survival with native heart recovery not only allows for improved ejection fraction and quality of life for our patients, but also lowers overall health care costs.
A recent patient story reinforces this concept. Eric Braga, an active 47-year-old father and husband, began feeling shortness of breath and chest pain while playing laser tag with his kids. After his wife drove him to the emergency room at Clovis Community Medical Center in Fresno, California, Eric collapsed and coded at the entrance. The hospital staff performed CPR and shocked Eric multiple times. A catheterization confirmed a 100% occlusion in the LAD artery, a major source of blood flow to the left ventricle of the heart. Dr. Michael Gen implanted the Impella CP to provide Eric's heart hemodynamic support and placed stents to open the blocked artery. After 2 days of support, Eric's heart recovered, and the Impella pump was weaned and removed. Today, after 6 months, Eric's heart function has returned to normal, with an EF of 65%, and he continues to enjoy an active life with his wife and 3 children. Eric's story highlights the clinical benefit of percutaneous cost-effective solutions that promote both survival and a native heart recovery.
We continue to build our library of clinical data and cost-effectiveness studies for patients like Eric. This quarter, the American Heart Journal published survival data on 15,259 AMI cardiogenic shock patients in the Impella quality and assurance database, what we call the IQ.
Multivariate analysis revealed that survival was a function of best practices, such as Impella as a first support strategy, hemodynamic monitoring and Impella experience with implantation volume. This paper confirms the 70%-plus survival rates we see at top Impella sites, with cardiogenic shock protocols that require Impella be implanted pre-PCI. As evidenced by this publication, real-world data is being accepted and published by the clinical community. It is exciting to see independent physician-led initiatives like the National CSI, improving awareness and impacting survival and heart recovery around the U.S.
Turning to outside the U.S. In June, I visited Japan with several members of our senior management team. In Japan, we opened 8 new sites in Q1 and are on track to have 45 sites by the end of the fiscal year. As of July, 131 hospitals have downloaded the Impella application. 71 are currently approved by the government committee, and we have opened a total of 21 Japanese sites to date. Our first hemodynamic course in Tokyo was a great success, with nearly 100 physicians in attendance, representing both interventional cardiology and heart surgery.
I also had the opportunity to visit multiple hospitals, and it remains clear that the Japanese physician community both appreciates and understands the clinical need for hemodynamic support and native heart recovery.
Additionally, we've been planting the seeds in new countries over the last year, and we've treated patients in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Israel and, most recently, in India. 
To be clear, U.S., Germany and Japan remain our priority, but we are moving forward with heart recovery centers of excellence in select hospitals in specific countries.
Moving to our regulatory progress. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study ahead of schedule in mid-June. We've reviewed the data and are working with the FDA to establish a time line for submission and analysis of the results. As a company protocol, we do not publish or submit abstracts until the FDA has had the opportunity to review our studies. We anticipate more dialogue with the FDA and the steering committee on next steps in August. As a result, we are targeting November for publication and release at the American Heart Association conference.
In closing, we are on track to create the field of heart recovery as we penetrate the U.S. market and become the global standard of care over time. We believe our focus on sustainable growth with improving clinical outcomes will enable us to remain one of the fastest-growing GAAP-profitable medtech companies, with a strong balance sheet and extensive intellectual property portfolio. After Q1, we are well positioned for success in fiscal '19 and currently focused on execution in Q2. I would like to thank our customers for their commitment to advancing the standard of care and recognize our shareholders for their investment. The secret of our success and execution remains our commitment to our purpose of recovering hearts and patients' first values within our culture.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."
247589,573240547,1509825,"ABIOMED, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Abiomed, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million, or 36%, versus last year, with performance across all geographies.

In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million, or 36%, versus last year, with performance across all geographies. U.S. Impella revenue rose 32% to $152 million, driven by a 30% increase in patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $22 million and was up 75% versus last year due to the continuous strength in Germany, which saw revenues increase 42% and our Japanese launch. We are pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan where revenue totaled $2.6 million for the quarter as we opened up 8 new sites. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q1, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at roughly 1,200 sites.  Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 540 and 320 sites, respectively. We expect to see continued demand for the 5.0 and RP in the coming quarters.
Reorder performance also continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorder revenue was $145 million, which translated into a reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP rose slightly from 3.8 units per site to 4.0 during the quarter.
Gross margin in Q1 was 82.9% compared to 83.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to product and geographic mix as well as incremental manufacturing investments to support our future growth object -- initiatives. 
R&D expense for the first quarter was $21 million, a 26% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was driven by investments for new products and enhancements, such as smart assist, Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as clinical cost for the STEMI trial and cVAD Registry studies. 
Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, which will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth.
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $81 million, an increase of $21 million, or 34%, versus prior year. The variance was due to additional training programs, incentive compensation, our Japanese launch and the expansion of our industry-leading commercial team. We will continue to make these investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration.
Operating income grew 41% to $47 million in the quarter, which translated to an operating margin of 26%. The 26% was a Q1 record for the company. Our margin expansion of 100 basis points was due to higher volume, which more than offset our growth investments.
We are on track to invest in our training and educational programs as well as to add commercial employees at a faster pace in the first half of this year. We believe the early investment will be advantageous as we head into the second half of 2019.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million, or $1.95 per share, up 141% versus Q1 of '18. The company saw a benefit of $54 million, or $1.17 per share, of excess tax benefits relating to employee share-based compensation awards, which are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.
We expect excess tax benefits to have the largest impact on the first quarter, given our investing schedule, and we'll likely see smaller adjustments in the final 3 quarters of the year.
Our balance sheet remains debt free, and we ended the quarter with $367 million of cash and marketable securities. Our standard practice is to use cash to pay employee withholding taxes when ours use  [indiscernible] instead of settling shares in the market. As a result, in Q1, we utilized $68 million of cash to reduce dilution from stock compensation. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Before turning to full year guidance, I'd like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the catheterization labs and physician vacations. As a result, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below Q1. With that said, given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by 2 points, or $15 million, and expect revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year.
In summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 and beyond.

You can wean people off the pump without having the risk of retrograde flow. It does provide pulsatility as you wean it down, and it's going to give these patients more than 6 liters of peak flow.

And the follow-up, just sticking with the OUS theme, and I have one on STEMI. The announcement today on India, congratulations there. Just thoughts on why this country ahead of, say, other European markets? And then what your plans are for rollout in India over time? And then on  STEMI, just as we look at the -- a readout later this year, the primary outcome there is infarct size as a percent of total mass, but you have several secondary endpoints, which -- and you have 2 time frames on those endpoints, a 3- to 5-day measure and then a 30-day measure. One of those is all-cause mortality. So I'm just -- what do you think will resonate across all of those endpoints? Clearly, the primary will drive some attention, but there's a lot of secondary endpoints in there as well. So what is going to be most interesting when you get that read on STEMI?"

So as I commented in my prepared remarks, we are planting seeds outside the U.S., but our main focus is still the U.S., Germany and Japan. That's our priority. There are centers of excellence out there in certain countries. There is interest, and we will continue to work with those sites to help drive a relationship with the government to establish reimbursement as -- for heart therapy -- for heart recovery. So this is a new concept and that's what Germany has recognized, the U.S. FDA has recognized, and that's what Japan has recognized. And so where we find partners and we work with the governments to bring this technology together, the best way to do that is to have the right key opinion leaders and researchers within the country. This matches the way we entered other parts of Europe, and we'll continue to follow that formula. On your question on STEMI, the study was a safety and feasibility study because the concept was somewhat radical that we were asking people to precondition the left ventricle, which means that they were unloading for 30 minutes before opening up the blockage. That's something that isn't done today. We're not recommending it commercial in any way. It is a study that we can utilize to then get to a pivotal because we think that there's 2 benefits of unloading. One benefit is preconditioning the myocardium before revascularization because we think it creates a cascade of events that reduces the apoptosis process, which means it can keep the heart muscle from dying or risking the infarct size. And then the second benefit is unloading during the procedure and after what we've done is -- and what we've proven is that it does unload, it does reduce the oxygen demand and work on the myocardium. So those 2 things were in play. We've always intended to go to a pivotal, but as I mentioned, we do have a strict policy that we don't talk about our studies until the FDA has the chance to review it. There's also the academic integrity of the information. Before it will be announced, it has to be kept confidential. And we are excited to continue to advance the science. The one thing I would reference or note for investors if they want to understand or read more about the solid science behind this. There's a publication that just came out in JACC. It's called Left Ventricular Unloading Before Reperfusion Promotes Functional Recovery After Acute Myocardial Infarction, and Dr. Kapur is one of the lead authors. So it does explain a lot of what you're asking about is what will people be most excited about. But certainly, what we're trying to do is prevent heart failure for patients that have heart attack, leave the hospital alive, but within 5 years, 70% have heart failure. So that's more to come on that as the publication and the information gets released."

And then the long-term benefits, unfortunately, for the patients is they do take effect starting in the first year, with 25% going into heart failure and, obviously, they're very poor in 5 years. So we think there's things you can see. There's also if you -- per the paper I referenced, it does talk about some of the things you can test around the expression of genes associated with the cardioprotective response in the heart. So there's other ways to look at and analyze what's happening when you're unloading a patient that has a large infarct area. So we're excited to see the science advanced, and I -- again, to your question, I think there will be both short and longer-term signal there to show benefits to these patients."

And so that's not only one of the most significant outcomes we can produce for a patient, but it's probably one of the highest cost savings that exist in all the medtech because you're talking about patients that they're not going to die immediately, they die organ at a time, and then they die over time with multiple surgeries, potentially implantable devices, followed by a transplant if they're capable, followed by it all over again within 5 to 10 years based on the response to the autoimmune therapy. So this is a profound change in the standard of care. The more science that comes out around unloading and the benefits and the more people see that these protocols, these best practices can have an impact, the more I think it will be demanded by the communities out there."

So from an R&D expectations, we continue to look to build those cVAD Registry's data in our IQ database.

I have personally been to the hospitals, both hospitals, and I've seen patients on support.

In Germany, there's a lot of research around patients that have heart failure that are Class III. Some believe in stem cell therapy, which is very -- there's a lot of interest in Japan over that. But also, in Germany, there's a lot of interest in reduction of the inflammatory response. And some of these patients may be treated with autoimmune suppression drugs. There is research that has been out, and there's more to come, showing that by unloading the left ventricle, you can reduce that inflammatory response. And there's a lot of these physicians that are looking at research of providing an extended period of unloading, which can have the ability to, again, have some recovery. There's also another paper that just came out of the Journal of American College of Cardiology, and the main author is Dr. Nir Uriel, who is a heart failure cardiologist in Chicago, and it's on mechanical unloading in heart failures, now chronic patients and also shows that the benefits of unloading can have the -- a potential -- can create a potential improvement in patients that have chronic heart failure. The sweet spot for us is to support these patients before they become Class IV, they become extremely sick, whether in heart failure and having organ failure, but there's more science, and there's a lot more work to do for this product. We have to continue to collect the data the right way, ensure that it's safe, but we know it's an improvement off the 5.0, it is higher flow, it's easier to implant, and it's -- we believe it's just a better pump.

Abiomed is committed to sustainable growth and improving outcomes each quarter. We do this through advanced training, product enhancements and sharing of best practices derived from real-world experience.
We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and increased manufacturing capacity while expanding Impella adoption with new products, new indications and new geographies.
In Q1, we also completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study. I'm proud of the entire team's continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives.
For today's call, I would like to highlight 2 topics: first, on our training and education to drive adoption and improve clinical outcomes; and second, I will provide an update on key strategic initiatives around Japan and our FDA study.
To start, the adoption of Impella is a function of training, data and time. This quarter, we maximized our resources in training and education across the globe and set new records for physician and employee engagement. We trained more internal people in Q1 than ever before, with nearly 500 employees at our commercial kickoff meeting and added 52 new global employees, including 14 people in the U.S. commercial distribution. Training first this quarter include hosting our first German Impella RP course, our first Tokyo heart recovery hemodynamic course and our first Women's Initiative Heart Recovery Advisory Board meeting. We educated over 750 physicians through on-site training, symposia or headquarters collaboration at our heart recovery institutes in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany.
Additionally, we trained 28 Protected PCI coordinators, and there are now approximately 60 hospitals with a dedicated role. Protected PCI coordinators will help identify appropriate patients, facilitate heart team collaboration and conduct outreach programs to help find undertreated, advanced coronary artery disease patients in the community. We believe our focus and investment on training will translate to increased Impella adoption and improved patient outcomes. Increased patient survival with native heart recovery not only allows for improved ejection fraction and quality of life for our patients, but also lowers overall health care costs.
A recent patient story reinforces this concept. Eric Braga, an active 47-year-old father and husband, began feeling shortness of breath and chest pain while playing laser tag with his kids. After his wife drove him to the emergency room at Clovis Community Medical Center in Fresno, California, Eric collapsed and coded at the entrance. The hospital staff performed CPR and shocked Eric multiple times. A catheterization confirmed a 100% occlusion in the LAD artery, a major source of blood flow to the left ventricle of the heart. Dr. Michael Gen implanted the Impella CP to provide Eric's heart hemodynamic support and placed stents to open the blocked artery. After 2 days of support, Eric's heart recovered, and the Impella pump was weaned and removed. Today, after 6 months, Eric's heart function has returned to normal, with an EF of 65%, and he continues to enjoy an active life with his wife and 3 children. Eric's story highlights the clinical benefit of percutaneous cost-effective solutions that promote both survival and a native heart recovery.
We continue to build our library of clinical data and cost-effectiveness studies for patients like Eric. This quarter, the American Heart Journal published survival data on 15,259 AMI cardiogenic shock patients in the Impella quality and assurance database, what we call the IQ.
Multivariate analysis revealed that survival was a function of best practices, such as Impella as a first support strategy, hemodynamic monitoring and Impella experience with implantation volume. This paper confirms the 70%-plus survival rates we see at top Impella sites, with cardiogenic shock protocols that require Impella be implanted pre-PCI. As evidenced by this publication, real-world data is being accepted and published by the clinical community. It is exciting to see independent physician-led initiatives like the National CSI, improving awareness and impacting survival and heart recovery around the U.S.
Turning to outside the U.S. In June, I visited Japan with several members of our senior management team. In Japan, we opened 8 new sites in Q1 and are on track to have 45 sites by the end of the fiscal year. As of July, 131 hospitals have downloaded the Impella application. 71 are currently approved by the government committee, and we have opened a total of 21 Japanese sites to date. Our first hemodynamic course in Tokyo was a great success, with nearly 100 physicians in attendance, representing both interventional cardiology and heart surgery.
I also had the opportunity to visit multiple hospitals, and it remains clear that the Japanese physician community both appreciates and understands the clinical need for hemodynamic support and native heart recovery.
Additionally, we've been planting the seeds in new countries over the last year, and we've treated patients in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Israel and, most recently, in India. 
To be clear, U.S., Germany and Japan remain our priority, but we are moving forward with heart recovery centers of excellence in select hospitals in specific countries.
Moving to our regulatory progress. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment for our FDA STEMI DTU safety and feasibility study ahead of schedule in mid-June. We've reviewed the data and are working with the FDA to establish a time line for submission and analysis of the results. As a company protocol, we do not publish or submit abstracts until the FDA has had the opportunity to review our studies. We anticipate more dialogue with the FDA and the steering committee on next steps in August. As a result, we are targeting November for publication and release at the American Heart Association conference.
In closing, we are on track to create the field of heart recovery as we penetrate the U.S. market and become the global standard of care over time. We believe our focus on sustainable growth with improving clinical outcomes will enable us to remain one of the fastest-growing GAAP-profitable medtech companies, with a strong balance sheet and extensive intellectual property portfolio. After Q1, we are well positioned for success in fiscal '19 and currently focused on execution in Q2. I would like to thank our customers for their commitment to advancing the standard of care and recognize our shareholders for their investment. The secret of our success and execution remains our commitment to our purpose of recovering hearts and patients' first values within our culture.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."
247589,573240547,1510318,"ABIOMED, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Abiomed, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.

In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, an increase of $48 million, or 36%, versus last year, with performance across all geographies. U.S. Impella revenue rose 32% to $152 million, driven by a 30% increase in patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $22 million and was up 75% versus last year due to the continuous strength in Germany, which saw revenues increase 42% and our Japanese launch. We are pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan where revenue totaled $2.6 million for the quarter as we opened up 8 new sites. Additionally, worldwide service revenue was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 19% versus prior year.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q1, the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP have been placed at roughly 1,200 sites. Additionally, the Impella 5.0 and the Impella RP are currently at 540 and 320 sites, respectively. We expect to see continued demand for the 5.0 and RP in the coming quarters.
Reorder performance also continued to be strong in the quarter. U.S. reorder revenue was $145 million, which translated into a reorder rate of approximately 100%. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and the Impella CP rose slightly from 3.8 units per site to 4.0 during the quarter.
Gross margin in Q1 was 82.9% compared to 83.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to product and geographic mix as well as incremental manufacturing investments to support our future growth object -- initiatives. 
R&D expense for the first quarter was $21 million, a 26% increase from the prior year. The bulk of the increase was driven by investments for new products and enhancements, such as smart assist, Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as clinical cost for the STEMI trial and cVAD Registry studies. 
Our platform of Impella products gives us the ability to make efficient investments in technology, which will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth.
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $81 million, an increase of $21 million, or 34%, versus prior year. The variance was due to additional training programs, incentive compensation, our Japanese launch and the expansion of our industry-leading commercial team. We will continue to make these investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration.
Operating income grew 41% to $47 million in the quarter, which translated to an operating margin of 26%. The 26% was a Q1 record for the company. Our margin expansion of 100 basis points was due to higher volume, which more than offset our growth investments.
We are on track to invest in our training and educational programs as well as to add commercial employees at a faster pace in the first half of this year. We believe the early investment will be advantageous as we head into the second half of 2019.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million, or $1.95 per share, up 141% versus Q1 of '18. The company saw a benefit of $54 million, or $1.17 per share, of excess tax benefits relating to employee share-based compensation awards, which are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.
We expect excess tax benefits to have the largest impact on the first quarter, given our investing schedule, and we'll likely see smaller adjustments in the final 3 quarters of the year.
Our balance sheet remains debt free, and we ended the quarter with $367 million of cash and marketable securities. Our standard practice is to use cash to pay employee withholding taxes when ours use [indiscernible] instead of settling shares in the market. As a result, in Q1, we utilized $68 million of cash to reduce dilution from stock compensation. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Before turning to full year guidance, I'd like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the catheterization labs and physician vacations. As a result, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below Q1. With that said, given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by 2 points, or $15 million, and expect revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year.
In summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 and beyond.

Clearly, the primary will drive some attention, but there's a lot of secondary endpoints in there as well. So what is going to be most interesting when you get that read on STEMI?"

So as I commented in my prepared remarks, we are planting seeds outside the U.S., but our main focus is still the U.S., Germany and Japan. That's our priority. There are centers of excellence out there in certain countries. There is interest, and we will continue to work with those sites to help drive a relationship with the government to establish reimbursement as -- for heart therapy -- for heart recovery. So this is a new concept and that's what Germany has recognized, the U.S. FDA has recognized, and that's what Japan has recognized. And so where we find partners and we work with the governments to bring this technology together, the best way to do that is to have the right key opinion leaders and researchers within the country. This matches the way we entered other parts of Europe, and we'll continue to follow that formula. On your question on STEMI, the study was a safety and feasibility study because the concept was somewhat radical that we were asking people to precondition the left ventricle, which means that they were unloading for 30 minutes before opening up the blockage. That's something that isn't done today. We're not recommending it commercial in any way. It is a study that we can utilize to then get to a pivotal because we think that there's 2 benefits of unloading. One benefit is preconditioning the myocardium before revascularization because we think it creates a cascade of events that reduces the apoptosis process, which means it can keep the heart muscle from dying or risking the infarct size. And then the second benefit is unloading during the procedure and after what we've done is -- and what we've proven is that it does unload, it does reduce the oxygen demand and work on the myocardium. So those 2 things were in play. We've always intended to go to a pivotal, but as I mentioned, we do have a strict policy that we don't talk about our studies until the FDA has the chance to review it. There's also the academic integrity of the information. Before it will be announced, it has to be kept confidential. And we are excited to continue to advance the science. The one thing I would reference or note for investors if they want to understand or read more about the solid science behind this. There's a publication that just came out in JACC. It's called Left Ventricular Unloading Before Reperfusion Promotes Functional Recovery After Acute Myocardial Infarction, and Dr. Kapur is one of the lead authors. So it does explain a lot of what you're asking about is what will people be most excited about. But certainly, what we're trying to do is prevent heart failure for patients that have heart attack, leave the hospital alive, but within 5 years, 70% have heart failure. So that's more to come on that as the publication and the information gets released."

And the first benefit can be seen short term in an infarct zone with an MRI -- cardiac MRI, and you can potentially see that in 30 days. And then the long-term benefits, unfortunately, for the patients is they do take effect starting in the first year, with 25% going into heart failure and, obviously, they're very poor in 5 years. So we think there's things you can see. There's also if you -- per the paper I referenced, it does talk about some of the things you can test around the expression of genes associated with the cardioprotective response in the heart. So there's other ways to look at and analyze what's happening when you're unloading a patient that has a large infarct area. So we're excited to see the science advanced, and I -- again, to your question, I think there will be both short and longer-term signal there to show benefits to these patients."

But again, we're not talking about a 90-year-old only, and we're not talking about 1 less day in the ICU. We're talking about a young population that gets to live and go home with their own heart. And so that's not only one of the most significant outcomes we can produce for a patient, but it's probably one of the highest cost savings that exist in all the medtech because you're talking about patients that they're not going to die immediately, they die organ at a time, and then they die over time with multiple surgeries, potentially implantable devices, followed by a transplant if they're capable, followed by it all over again within 5 to 10 years based on the response to the autoimmune therapy. So this is a profound change in the standard of care. The more science that comes out around unloading and the benefits and the more people see that these protocols, these best practices can have an impact, the more I think it will be demanded by the communities out there."

I have personally been to the hospitals, both hospitals, and I've seen patients on support.

In Germany, there's a lot of research around patients that have heart failure that are Class III. Some believe in stem cell therapy, which is very -- there's a lot of interest in Japan over that. But also, in Germany, there's a lot of interest in reduction of the inflammatory response. And some of these patients may be treated with autoimmune suppression drugs. There is research that has been out, and there's more to come, showing that by unloading the left ventricle, you can reduce that inflammatory response. And there's a lot of these physicians that are looking at research of providing an extended period of unloading, which can have the ability to, again, have some recovery. There's also another paper that just came out of the Journal of American College of Cardiology, and the main author is Dr. Nir Uriel, who is a heart failure cardiologist in Chicago, and it's on mechanical unloading in heart failures, now chronic patients and also shows that the benefits of unloading can have the -- a potential -- can create a potential improvement in patients that have chronic heart failure. The sweet spot for us is to support these patients before they become Class IV, they become extremely sick, whether in heart failure and having organ failure, but there's more science, and there's a lot more work to do for this product. We have to continue to collect the data the right way, ensure that it's safe, but we know it's an improvement off the 5.0, it is higher flow, it's easier to implant, and it's -- we believe it's just a better pump.

In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. station utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock. On a constant currency basis, European revenue increased 38%, while German revenue was up 33%. In Japan, our business continues to perform very well, delivering $4.1 million in revenue, with 35 hospitals trained and 83 hospitals approved by the government. 
Abiomed is positioned for sustainable growth and building the field of heart recovery with disciplined execution. We have established a strong foundation with our innovation, technology, balance sheet and intellectual property portfolio. As a result, we are following our Impella adoption formula of training, data and time. It was highly evident at TCT that Abiomed is improving training and education with smart assist, Impella connect, and with clinical data presented the from the IQ, Impella Quality Assurance Database, cVAD and NCSI. We are also significantly investing in our products and analyzing real-time clinical data to identify best practices for waning within hospital protocols, and we continue to collaborate on education with physician-led initiatives, like NCSI, Teach and [indiscernible]. 
For today's call, I will highlight continued validation of Impella hemodynamic support with best practices for patients in cardiogenic shock and the new data on the potential to reduce the risk of AKI, acute kidney injury, for high-risk PCI procedures. 
The best validation of the Impella therapy starts with the story of patients like Libby McKeon. Libby, a 52 -year-old woman from Ohio, suffered a heart attack while driving and crashed into a cornfield near her home. Her in-car emergency system notified first responders of the crash and upon arrival, EMT has worked to resuscitate Libby with defamiliarization and CPR as they rushed her to Lima Memorial Hospital in Lima, Ohio. 
Dr. Zane Dean, an interventional cardiologist, quickly identified cardiogenic shock and an emergent need for hemodynamic support. He inserted the Impella CP to stabilize Libby in that cath lab, while placing stens to restore coronary blood flow. Libby remained on Impella support for 2 days and was successfully weaned off of the device. 
Libby was discharged home after 10 days with her native heart, and with a near-normal ejection fraction of approximately 50% to 55%. This is another example of an unresponsive patient in cardiogenic shock and stresses the benefit of shock protocols to improve outcomes. This is another example of both survival and native heart recovery, and the impact to the patient's quality of life and cost effectiveness. 
Libby avoided the cascade of the most invasive and expensive products and procedures in cardiovascular care. 
At the TC Conference in September, there were multiple new clinical data states and presentations around Impella and unloading therapy. Following last year's physician-led cardiogenic shock call to arms, Dr. Bill O'Neill presented updated results from 104 patients in the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, and CSI. After more than 20 years of stagnant shock survival rates at roughly 50%, NCSI has now demonstrated a survival of 77% with 99% of survivors discharged home with their native heart. More than 56 U.S. hospitals have now joined the NCSI initiative and momentum continues to grow. The importance of Impella in treatment protocols for shock patients was further validated with the presentation on the main stage at TCT, with new clinical data from the Impella quality assurance IQ commercial database. This analysis of 11,566 patients at all hospitals revealed that our efforts with training and data have improved mean survival rates across the nation from 51% to 63%, and the numbers of centers achieving survival rates greater than 70% has increased from 25% to 39% with utilization of best practice protocols. 
This October, a new paper titled cardiac shock care centers was published in JACC, and reiterated the need for AMI shock protocols. The publication references multiple studies, including NCSI and IQ, and outlines a suggested shock care algorithm, stating that the rapid the initiation of mechanical statutory support is paramount. 
This paper also addresses the IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump, stating that multiple trials have shown no survival benefit from the device and states that it is not recommended further evidence-based shock care pathway algorithm. 
As a reminder, the intra-aortic balloon pump is Class III or considered harmful for cardiogenic shock in European and Japanese guidelines. 
Additionally, there is growing physician awareness of Impella's ability to protect against acute kidney injury, AKI. On our year end call in May, we highlighted a clinical paper published in circulation, showing the use of Impella for high-risk PCI patients and significant reduction in the risk of AKI and need for dialysis. Two additional studies by [indiscernible] at Heinrich High University in Düsseldorf Germany have replicated these results of AKI risk reduction with Impella support. These results also reinforced the Protect II RCT FDA study and matched what we currently observed in our CVAD that study. AKI remains a critical challenge for heart failure patients and procedures, such as PCI, CABG and Dabber. 
Before closing, I would like to remind all investors that the STEMI DTU FDA safety and feasibility study will be presented in the late breaking clinical trials at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time on November 11 at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Chicago. Since we recognize that many of our investors will not be attending, Abiomed will host a short call for investors on Monday, November 12 at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. 
In summary, we are executing our plan for sustainable growth, while helping to improve patient outcomes, focused on native heart recovery. Abiomed is concentrating on execution, with 10% penetration of U.S. patients, with critical clinical needs today for high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. It is also rewarding to see physician-led initiatives, aligning treatment goals and care pathways to improve patient outcomes.

We are confident in our future with Impella growth opportunities of several hundred thousand patients, with new and existing indications, new products and new geographies. No other company provides approved percutaneous heart pumps that unload the left and right ventricle and protect and recover heart muscle for elective urgent and emergent patients. I am proud of our employees and appreciate their dedication to recovering hearts and saving lives, and I'm thankful to our customers and our shareholders for their continued support. I will now turn the call over to Todd Trap, our CFO."

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29",662,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29% increase in overall patient utilization. 
Outside the U.S., revenue was $24 million, up 67% versus last year due to commercial launch in Japan and continued strength in Europe, which saw revenues increase 38% on a constant currency. 
We continue to be pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan, where revenue totaled $4.1 million for the quarter, as we opened up 14 new sites. 
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q2, the Impella 2.5 and CP have been placed at approximately 1,250 sites, while the Impella 5.0 and RP are at 559 and 368 sites, respectively. 
Reordered performance in the quarter was also strong, with a rate slightly above 100%, consistent with the prior quarter. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.2 units per site during the quarter as higher volume hospitals carry more inventory to support their cases. 
In the second quarter, gross margin was 83.6%, relatively similar to last year. The benefit from higher volume was offset by manufacturing investments, such as direct labor hires, to support our future growth. 
R&D expense for the quarter totaled $23 million, up 17% versus prior year. The increase was driven by investments for new products such as smart assist, the Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as for data collection related to our CVAD study. These investments will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the second quarter was $79 million, up 31% versus prior year. The increase was due to expansion of our commercial team, additional marketing and training programs, higher incentive compensation and support of our Japanese launch. We will continue to make these growth investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration and our top 3 targeted countries of the U.S., Germany and Japan. 
In the second quarter, we delivered $50 million of operating income, an increase of 59% versus prior year. This translated into an operating margin of 27.7%, a Q2 record for the company. Our margin expanded 380 basis points over prior year due to higher volume, which more than offset our investments. 
GAAP net income for the quarter was $50 million or $1.09 per diluted share, up 104% versus Q2 of '18. In the quarter, the company saw a benefit of approximately $13 million or $0.28 per share from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. 
Normalized in the impact from excess tax benefits, EPS increased 84% versus Q2 of '18, mainly driven by strong operations and a lower effective tax rate. 
Our balance sheet remains debt-free, and we ended the quarter with $410 million of cash in marketable securities. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage. 
Turning to guidance. Given our execution and a strong first half performance, we are, again, raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by $10 million to a new range of $765 million to $770 million, up 29% to 30% for the year. 
The previous guidance, post Q1, was $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year. We expect to see solid growth in the second half, even as we start to lap some challenging comes, and we continue to train our field team at headquarters for within the region on existing new products, expanded indications and updated clinical papers. 
So in summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies, while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for 2019 and beyond. Operator, please now open the line for questions."

We, again, raised the low end of the range for the second time at the end of Q2 by another $10 million. Again, in line with past practices. So we do have some new hires in the field, and we'll continue to train either our headquarters or within our region on new products like smart assist, new indications and new clinical publications. As you mentioned, I do think it is worth noting that we have do have some tougher comps as we had to the second half of the year. But listen, at the end of the day, if we have the top end of our guidance range, this will be the fourth consecutive year of 30-plus percent top line growth. And I don't think there's too many companies out there that have demonstrated this type of consistent performance. So again, we'll continue to grow at a pace that we think is sustainable, and our goal is to remain one of the fastest-growing, most profitable medtech companies in the market. So we'll revisit the guidance at the end of the Q3, and we'll adjust if necessary."

If you look at the Protect II data, they randomized arm of Impella had a significantly more contrast but had numerically lower renal failure than the intra-aortic balloon pump arm. And what you've seen prior to that is all studies that show a direct correlation, more contract leads to more renal failure. In the near end score, which is accepted predictive risk door for AKI, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump actually adds to risks, add points because of the way it is positioned in designing of aorta as well it's requirement of perfect timing. And with the Impella, we continue to see the -- some additional benefits of unloading but also in increasing year end production. Some physicians actually will call Impella a year-end pump, and so we're going to continue to study it. We have RCTF data and Protect II. We have data from our CVAD study that was presented at TCT, showing, again, the predicted AKI rate is significantly cut and reduced with the use of Impella, both 2.5 and CP, and there's some interesting papers that are coming out of Europe by was Wes and Feld, which I commented on my prepared remarks, showing that the use of Impella, again, significantly reduces the expected rate for the May run score and also 1 study that showed the use of Aachen significantly increased AKI. So there will be more studies to come, and we plan to see this -- continue to expand over the next 10 years because it is a significant problem in use of contrast for PCI. It is a significant problem of taber. I believe the taber AKI rate is around 25% to 30%. Again, because there's a correlation with a heart failure, and it's definitely a problem with [ cabbage ]. So a great opportunity for us and we're going to maintain a studies and continue to publish on AKI for a long time."

We have the IQ Database, which is nearly 95% of our commercial patients where we get outcomes to plan, and we also collect high-level data, and we're expanding it that to be able to analyze protocols for both, basically high-risk PCI and shock, whether it's from AMI or cardiomyopathy. So we've got a plethora of data coming in. We then have the cVAD and used the term registry, used to be called the cVAD registry study. We actually dropped the word registry at TCT because we've converted now -- the cVAD study is a prospective IRB-approved study, ongoing at a select number of centers for all patients, all indications and all products, and that allows us then to look at both unique uses in collect data and potentially allow us to expand our labor. And we've embedded 5 post-market studies inside the cVAD study, and we'll continue to those studies indefinitely. And so this gives us basically the world's largest database of patients that are having heart failure that need hemodynamic support, and we think that the current product, the Impella 5.5, which is approved in Europe, is really going to be a great product to look at those patients that may want to ambulate, do have the ability to wean off, come off inotropes and the algorithms we're now developing on the console with the fiber-optic sensor is we can see what's happening as you wean the pump down, because it's a forward flow pump, you introduce pulsatility. And as you wean it down, you can see on the console if the left ventricle has the ability to recover. Because if you're taking the pump down at you see the cardiac output maintain or go up, you know the heart can reload. And because we now have Impella connect with the fiber-optic sensor, we're able to real-time monitor those patients, and I that will give us the ability as these patients as we develop more protocols and algorithms, allow these patients a little bit longer time and be in placed to the [indiscernible] they can be mobile, ambulate, walk around. And we're really going to then develop these protocols around weaning patients, which is not something you can do with implantable VADs because of the way they're implanted and how they corrupt the ventricle. So we are very excited. The target population that we're focused on for those advanced studies in the future will be around cardiomyopathy shock and will continue to look at patients that may be more Class III, that are not interested in the transplant or are not yet sick enough. And what we'll try to do is get them back to baseline and match it with adjunctive therapies in the future, new drugs or stem cells or immunosuppression therapy. So it's going to have a long runway. And again, the innovation of this platform is it allows us to unload the ventricle, reduce the work, increase coronary flow and profuse the rest of the body and support of the end organs, especially the kidneys."

Those are the top 3 markets in the world for medtech, and if we can establish Impella as the standard of care there, it has a great influence and allows us to spread to these other countries. What we look for is the physician's societies with the government to recognize that Impella is a new therapy, that it's an unloading therapy, and it has the ability to enable major heart recovery. That's been done and that's been accepted in the U.S., in Germany and in Japan, and we'll continue to make sure that we can improve the efforts in some of these countries we've launched with our best practice protocols. As we start to go in cities, these next range of countries out there, we do that with the newer technology. We'll look to have the Impella Connect as a standard in the future, so as places are expanding, we'll be able to monitor those patients and ensure the protocols and the treatment matches what we see in the U.S., Germany and Japan. And we'll be able to continue to publish and collect data around native heart recovery. In other countries, transplants or implantable LVADs are not an option and recovery always remains their most cost-effective solution, and that's where we continue to invest in the training and education. And so from a distribution and investment perspective, we now have an organization that's dedicated to developing and planting these seeds. As we've announced, we have cases in patients being down in Australia and India and several other countries, but we're going to do it under our current plan, which is to get a commitment from, again, the countries on what Impella is and what heart recovery therapy can enable. And by doing that, we'll invest to go direct, so we can ensure we can get the best outcomes in the ICU."

In healthcare, you've got the regulatory and the clinical barriers, but what's been shown to be the #1 driver of the adoption is really getting the FDA approval and getting some guideline attention. And so this paper I've referenced in JACC that's that cardiac shock care centers, it is really a fantastic paper because it's going through and outlining the limitations of the outcomes over the last 20 years. And in U.S. hospitals today, sites that are getting 50% survival are matching what's been done over the last 20 years. And the sites that have adopted these best practice protocols, they can get up towards of 70% survival, but most important, nearly all of these patients recover their native heart. They discharged home with their own heart with the quality of life that is acceptable. And in other prior studies, even if 50% metric or number that's thrown out, there's no mention of whether the patients are in hospice care or die 6 months later or Class IV heart failure patients. So this is also why the STEMI education is so important, because if you look at STEMI patients that go into shock, that live, again, 70% of them are in heart failure within 5 years. And I think the -- in Europe and with -- in Germany and Japan, the intra-aortic balloon pump is already deemed Class  III, and this recent paper in some of the momentum we're seeing from NCSI is really highlighting the fact that 50% survival for shock patients is unacceptable, and we can do better. And it's really been physician-led, and it's great to see this paper."

Again, it talks about what's happening to these patients with reperfusion injury, and there's another great paper from a New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 by Derek Helen, which gives the mechanisms of the disease of myocardial reperfusion injuries. So that reperfusion injury has been around a long time. It's well accepted. And what's happening is that, while opening up the block coronary within 90 minutes has improved survival. We're really studying the effect of what happens after survival, what's happening where the module myocardium, and is there a better way to enhance and augment better survival with reduction of infarct.

If you look at the late majority, the late majority's #1 concern is access, 14 French hole or 12 French hole. And so we approach that concern with education, and we point out that the cAVR started at 22, and it's now 14, and it's a skill set that many of them and they've overcome it. We pointed that out in Protect II. The intra-aortic balloon pump had numerically higher vascular complications on the Impella, and the Impella show continued improvement throughout the study. And because of this experience and cAVR, access and closure technologies have advanced and continued to improve our outcomes. You'll see from the data presented at AHA what happens in an updated study with patients that are somewhat unstable with the heart attacks and how they -- how safe and feasible that is with Impella. And we do have some new technology that has to do with expandable sheets for the CP. And remember, the CP has a 9 French catheter, and that's really the driver of [indiscernible], it's not necessarily the hole. So outside of all the education and everything we're doing, it's a very simple discussion with interventional cardiologist if we can have a 9 French forward leader pump to help them do protective PCI. So it's a great interest, excitement and demand. We do think it's -- will be ideal for Protected PCI, and we think the CP will be ideal for shock patients because it's ability to have a motor onboard, produced the truest flow, measure cardiac power and output and help wean the patient off. And then of course, we think the 5.5 will be a tremendous pump for patients that want to get up, and walk around, to have the full flow and have the ability to wean off, especially as those cardiomyopathy shock to patients. So lots to come, but the ECP has a breakthrough product, and we are so excited to get to our first demand."

In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock",1062,"Thank you, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock. On a constant currency basis, European revenue increased 38%, while German revenue was up 33%. In Japan, our business continues to perform very well, delivering $4.1 million in revenue, with 35 hospitals trained and 83 hospitals approved by the government.
Abiomed is positioned for sustainable growth and building the field of heart recovery with disciplined execution. We have established a strong foundation with our innovation, technology, balance sheet and intellectual property portfolio. As a result, we're following our Impella adoption formula of training, data and time.
It was highly evident at TCT that Abiomed is improving training and education with SmartAssist, Impella Connect, and with clinical data presented from the IQ, Impella Quality Assurance Database, cVAD and NCSI. We're also significantly investing in our products and analyzing real-time clinical data to identify best practices for weaning within the hospital protocols. And we continue to collaborate on education with physician-led initiatives, like NCSI, TEACH and CHIP.
For today's call, I will highlight continued validation of Impella hemodynamic support with best practices for patients in cardiogenic shock and the new data on the potential to reduce the risk of AKI, acute kidney injury, for high-risk PCI procedures. 
The best validation of the Impella therapy starts with the story of patients like Libby McKean. Libby, a 52 -year-old woman from Ohio, suffered a heart attack while driving and crashed into a cornfield near her home. Her in-car emergency system notified first responders of the crash, and upon arrival, EMTs worked to resuscitate Libby with defibrillization and CPR as they rushed her to Lima Memorial Hospital in Lima, Ohio.
Dr. Zane Dean, an interventional cardiologist, quickly identified cardiogenic shock and an emergent need for hemodynamic support. He inserted the Impella CP to stabilize Libby in the cath lab, while placing stents to restore coronary blood flow. Libby remained on Impella support for 2 days and was successfully weaned off of the device. 
Libby was discharged home after 10 days with her native heart and with a near-normal ejection fraction of approximately 50% to 55%. This is another example of an unresponsive patient in cardiogenic shock and stresses the benefit of shock protocols to improve outcomes.
This is another example of both survival and native heart recovery and the impact to the patient's quality of life and cost effectiveness. Libby avoided the cascade of the most invasive and expensive products and procedures in cardiovascular care.
At the TC Conference in September, there were multiple new clinical data sets and presentations around Impella and unloading therapy. Following last year's physician-led cardiogenic shock call to arms, Dr. Bill O'Neill presented updated results from 104 patients in the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, NCSI.
After more than 20 years of stagnant shock survival rates at roughly 50%, NCSI has now demonstrated a survival of 77% with 99% of survivors discharged home with their native heart. More than 56 U.S. hospitals have now joined the NCSI initiative and momentum continues to grow. The importance of Impella and treatment protocols for shock patients was further validated with the presentation on the main stage at TCT, with new clinical data from the Impella Quality Assurance IQ commercial database. This analysis of 11,566 patients at all hospitals revealed that our efforts with training and data have improved mean survival rates across the nation from 51% to 63%, and the numbers of centers achieving survival rates greater than 70% has increased from 25% to 39% with utilization of best practice protocols.
This October, a new paper titled Cardiac Shock Care Centers was published in JACC and reiterated the need for AMI shock protocols. The publication references multiple studies, including NCSI and IQ and outlines a suggested shock care algorithm, stating that the rapid initiation of mechanical circulatory support is paramount.
This paper also addresses the IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump, stating that multiple trials have shown no survival benefit from the device and states that it is not recommended per their evidence-based shock care pathway algorithm. As a reminder, the intra-aortic balloon pump is Class III or considered harmful for cardiogenic shock in European and Japanese guidelines. 
Additionally, there is growing physician awareness of Impella's ability to protect against acute kidney injury, AKI. On our year-end call in May, we highlighted a clinical paper published in Circulation, showing the use of Impella for high-risk PCI patients and a significant reduction in the risk of AKI and need for a dialysis.
Two additional studies by Westenfeld at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany have replicated these results of AKI risk reduction with Impella support. These results also reinforce the Protect II RCT FDA study and matched what we currently observed in our cVAD study. AKI remains a critical clinical challenge for heart failure patients and procedures such as PCI, CABG and TAVR.
Before closing, I would like to remind all investors that the STEMI DTU FDA safety and feasibility study will be presented in the late-breaking clinical trials at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time on November 11 at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Chicago. Since we recognize that many of our investors will not be attending, Abiomed will host a short call for investors on Monday, November 12 at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
In summary, we are executing our plan for sustainable growth, while helping to improve patient outcomes, focused on native heart recovery. Abiomed is concentrating on execution, with 10% penetration of U.S. patients with critical clinical need today for high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. It is also rewarding to see physician-led initiatives, aligning treatment goals and care pathways to improve patient outcomes.
We are confident in our future with Impella growth opportunities of several hundred thousand patients, with new and existing indications, new products and new geographies. No other company provides approved percutaneous heart pumps that unload the left and right ventricle and protect and recover heart muscle for elective, urgent and emergent patients. I am proud of our employees and appreciate their dedication to recovering hearts and saving lives, and I'm thankful to our customers and our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies.

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29% increase in overall patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue was $24 million, up 67% versus last year due to the commercial launch in Japan and continued strength in Europe, which saw revenues increase 38% on a constant currency. We continue to be pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan, where revenue totaled $4.1 million for the quarter, as we opened up 14 new sites.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q2, the Impella 2.5 and CP have been placed at approximately 1,250 sites, while the Impella 5.0 and RP are at 559 and 368 sites, respectively. Reorder performance in the quarter was also strong, with a rate slightly above 100%, consistent with the prior quarter. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.2 units per site during the quarter as higher volume hospitals carried more inventory to support their cases.
In the second quarter, gross margin was 83.6%, relatively similar to last year. The benefit from higher volume was offset by manufacturing investments such as direct labor hires to support our future growth. R&D expense for the quarter totaled $23 million, up 17% versus prior year. The increase was driven by investments for new products such as SmartAssist, the Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as for data collection related to our cVAD study. These investments will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the second quarter was $79 million, up 31% versus prior year. The increase was due to expansion of our commercial team, additional marketing and training programs, higher incentive compensation and support of our Japanese launch. We will continue to make these growth investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration in our top 3 targeted countries of the U.S., Germany and Japan.
In the second quarter, we delivered $50 million of operating income, an increase of 59% versus prior year. This translated into an operating margin of 27.7%, a Q2 record for the company. Our margin expanded 380 basis points over prior year due to higher volume, which more than offset our investments.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $50 million or $1.09 per diluted share, up 104% versus Q2 of '18. In the quarter, the company saw a benefit of approximately $13 million or $0.28 per share from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Normalizing the impact from excess tax benefits, EPS increased 84% versus Q2 of '18, mainly driven by strong operations and a lower effective tax rate.
Our balance sheet remains debt-free, and we ended the quarter with $410 million of cash and marketable securities. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Turning to guidance. Given our execution and a strong first half performance, we are, again, raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by $10 million to a new range of $765 million to $770 million, up 29% to 30% for the year.
The previous guidance, post Q1, was $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year. We expect to see solid growth in the second half, even as we start to lap some challenging comps, and we continue to train our field team at headquarters or within the region on existing and new products, expanded indications and updated clinical papers.
So in summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies, while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for 2019 and beyond.

So we do have some new hires in the field, and we'll continue to train either at headquarters or within the region on our new products like SmartAssist, new indications and new clinical publications. As you mentioned, I do think it is worth noting that we do have some tougher comps as we head into the second half of the year. But listen, at the end of the day, if we hit the top end of our guidance range, this will be the fourth consecutive year of 30-plus percent top line growth. And I don't think there's too many companies out there that have demonstrated this type of consistent performance. So again, we'll continue to grow at a pace that we think is sustainable, and our goal is to remain one of the fastest-growing, most profitable medtech companies in the market.

For patients that have heart failure or advanced coronary disease, there is a correlation and link directly to heart failure with renal failure. If you look at the Protect II data, the randomized arm of Impella had a significantly more contrast, but had numerically lower renal failure than the intra-aortic balloon pump arm. And what you've seen prior to that is all studies show a direct correlation, more contrast yields to more renal failure. In the Mehran score, which is a accepted predictive risk score for AKI, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump actually adds to the risk, adds points, because of the way it is positioned in the designing of aorta as well its requirement of perfect timing. And with the Impella, we continue to see the -- some additional benefits of unloading but also in increasing urine production. Some physicians actually call Impella a urine pump, and so we're going to continue to study it. We have RCT FDA data in Protect II. We have data from our cVAD study that was presented at TCT, showing, again, the predicted AKI rate is significantly cut and reduced with the use of Impella, both 2.5 and CP, and there's some interesting papers that are coming out of Europe by Westenfeld, which I commented on in my prepared remarks, showing that the use of Impella, again, significantly reduces the expected rate per the Mehran score and also 1 study that showed the use of ECMO significantly increased AKI. So there will be more studies to come, and we plan to see this continue to expand over the next 10 years because this is a significant problem in use of contrast for PCI. It is a significant problem for TAVR. I believe the TAVR AKI rate is around 25% to 30%, again, because there's a correlation with heart failure, and it's definitely a problem with CABG. So a great opportunity for us, and we're going to maintain studies and continue to publish on AKI for a long time."

So first, let me frame it with the amount of data that we have coming in. We have the IQ Database, which is nearly 95% of our commercial patients where we get outcomes to X plant, and we also collect high-level data, and we're expanding that to be able to analyze protocols for both, basically high-risk PCI and then shock, whether it's from AMI or cardiomyopathy. So we've got a plethora of data coming in. We then have the cVAD and you used the term registry, used to be called the cVAD registry study. We actually dropped the word registry at TCT because we've converted now -- the cVAD study is a prospective IRB-approved study, ongoing at a select number of centers for all patients, all indications and all products, and that allows us then to look at both unique uses in collect data and potentially allow us to expand our labor. And we've embedded 5 post-market studies inside the cVAD study, and we'll continue those studies indefinitely. And so this gives us basically the world's largest database of patients that are having heart failure that need hemodynamic support. And we think that the current product, the Impella 5.5, which is approved in Europe, is really going to be a great product to look at those patients that may want to ambulate, do have the ability to wean off, come off inotropes. And the algorithms we're now developing on the console and with the fiber-optic sensor is we can see what's happening as you wean the pump down, because it's a forward flow pump, you introduce pulsatility. And as you wean it down, you can see on the console if the left ventricle has the ability to recover. Because if you're taking the pump down and you see the cardiac output maintain or go up, you know the heart can reload. And because we now have Impella Connect with the fiber-optic sensor, we're able to real-time monitor those patients, and that will give us the ability as these patients -- as we develop more protocols and algorithms allow these patients a little bit longer time and be in place with the axillary artery. They can be mobile, ambulate, walk around. And we're really going to then develop these protocols around weaning patients, which is not something you can do with implantable VADs because of the way they're implanted and how they core out the ventricle. So we are very excited. The target population that we're focused on for those advanced studies in the future will be around cardiomyopathy shock and will continue to look at patients that may be more Class III, that are not interested in a transplant or are not yet sick enough. And what we'll try to do is get them back to baseline and match it with adjunctive therapies in the future, new drugs or stem cells or immunosuppression therapy. So it's going to have a long runway. And again, the innovation of this platform is it allows us to unload the ventricle, reduce the work, increase coronary flow and profuse the rest of the body and support the end organs, especially kidneys."

Those are the top 3 markets in the world for medtech. And if we can establish Impella as the standard of care there, it has a great influence and allows us to spread to these other countries. What we look for is the physician societies with the government to recognize that Impella is a new therapy, that it's an unloading therapy, and it has ability to enable native heart recovery. That's been done and that's been accepted in the U.S., in Germany and in Japan, and we'll continue to make sure that we can improve the efforts. And in some of these countries, we launch with our best practice protocols. As we start to go in cities, this next range of countries out there, we do that with the newer technology. We'll look to have the Impella Connect as a standard in the future. So as places are expanding, we'll be able to monitor those patients and ensure the protocols and the treatment matches what we see in the U.S., Germany and Japan. And we'll be able to continue to publish and collect data around native heart recovery. In other countries, transplants or implantable LVADs are not an option, and recovery always remains the most cost-effective solution, and that's where we continue to invest in the training and education. And so from a distribution and investment perspective, we now have an organization that's dedicated to developing and planting new seeds. As we've announced, we have cases and patients being down in Australia and India and several other countries, but we're going to do it under our current plan, which is to get a commitment from, again, the countries on what Impella is and what heart recovery therapy can enable. And by doing that, we'll invest go direct, so we can ensure we can get the best outcomes in the ICU."

In healthcare, you've got the regulatory and the clinical barriers, but what's been shown to be the #1 driver of adoption is really getting the FDA approval and getting some guideline attention. And so this paper I referenced in JACC that's the Cardiac Shock Care Centers, is really a fantastic paper because it's going through and outlining the limitations of the outcomes over the last 20 years. And in U.S. hospitals today, sites that are getting 50% survival are matching what's been done over the last 20 years. And the sites that have adopted these best practice protocols, they can get upwards of 70% survival, but, most important, nearly all of these patients recover the native heart. They are discharged home with their own heart with the quality of life that is acceptable. And in other prior studies, even if 50% metric or number that's thrown out, there's no mention of whether the patients are in hospice care or die 6 months later or Class IV heart failure patients. So this is also why the STEMI education is so important, because if you look at STEMI patients that don't go into shock, that live, again, 70% of them are in heart failure within 5 years. And I think the -- in Europe and with -- in Germany and Japan, the intra-aortic balloon pump is already deemed Class  III, and this recent paper and some of the momentum we're seeing from NCSI is really highlighting the fact that 50% survival for shock patients is unacceptable, and we can do better.

And what's happening is that, while opening up the block coronary within 90 minutes has improved survival, we're really studying the effect of what happens after survival, what's happening with the myocardium, and is there a better way to enhance and augment better survival with reduction of infarct.

And so I think the seasonality of the business, we're going to drive more sales in the second half of the year. And again, I'm confident that we'll be in that 20% to 30% range for the year, which again is going to be up anywhere between 150 to 300 basis points year-over-year."

And so we approach that concern with education, and we point out that the TAVR started at 22, and is now 14, and it's a skill set that many of them have and they've overcome it. We point out that in Protect II. The intra-aortic balloon pump had numerically higher vascular complications on the Impella, and the Impella showed continued improvement throughout the study. And because of this experience and TAVR, access and closure technologies have advanced and continued to improve our outcomes. You'll see from the data presented at AHA what happens in an updated study with patients that are somewhat unstable with heart attacks and how they -- how safe and feasible that is with Impella. And we do have some new technology that has to do with expandable sheets for the CP. And remember, the CP has a 9 French catheter, and that's really the driver of leg ischemia. It's not necessarily the hole. So outside of all the education and everything we're doing, it's a very simple discussion with interventional cardiologist, if he can have a 9 French 4 liter pump to help them do Protected PCI. So there is great interest, excitement and demand. We do think it's -- will be ideal for Protected PCI, and we think the CP will be ideal for shock patients because its ability to have a motor onboard, produce the truest flow, measure cardiac power and output and help wean the patient off. And then, of course, we think the 5.5 will really be a tremendous pump for patients that want to get up and walk around to have full flow and have the ability to wean off, especially those cardiomyopathy shock patients. So lots to come, but the ECP is a breakthrough product, and we're so excited to get to our first-in-man."

In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock",1060,"Thank you, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock. On a constant currency basis, European revenue increased 38%, while German revenue was up 33%. In Japan, our business continues to perform very well, delivering $4.1 million in revenue, with 35 hospitals trained and 83 hospitals approved by the government.
Abiomed is positioned for sustainable growth and building the field of heart recovery with disciplined execution. We have established a strong foundation with our innovation, technology, balance sheet and intellectual property portfolio. As a result, we're following our Impella adoption formula of training, data and time.
It was highly evident at TCT that Abiomed is improving training and education with SmartAssist, Impella Connect and with clinical data presented from the IQ, Impella Quality Assurance Database, cVAD and NCSI. We're also significantly investing in our products and analyzing real-time clinical data to identify best practices for weaning within hospital protocols. And we continue to collaborate on education with physician-led initiatives, like NCSI, TEACH and CHIP.
For today's call, I will highlight continued validation of Impella hemodynamic support with best practices for patients in cardiogenic shock and the new data on the potential to reduce the risk of AKI, acute kidney injury, for high-risk PCI procedures. 
The best validation of the Impella therapy starts with the story of patients like Libby McKean. Libby, a 52-year-old woman from Ohio, suffered a heart attack while driving and crashed into a cornfield near her home. Her in-car emergency system notified first responders of the crash, and upon arrival, EMTs worked to resuscitate Libby with defibrillization and CPR as they rushed her to Lima Memorial Hospital in Lima, Ohio.
Dr. Zane Dean, an interventional cardiologist, quickly identified cardiogenic shock and an emergent need for hemodynamic support. He inserted the Impella CP to stabilize Libby in the cath lab, while placing stents to restore coronary blood flow. Libby remained on Impella support for 2 days and was successfully weaned off of the device. 
Libby was discharged home after 10 days with her native heart and with a near-normal ejection fraction of approximately 50% to 55%. This is another example of an unresponsive patient in cardiogenic shock and stresses the benefit of shock protocols to improve outcomes.
This is another example of both survival and native heart recovery and the impact to the patient's quality of life and cost effectiveness. Libby avoided the cascade of the most invasive and expensive products and procedures in cardiovascular care.
At the TC Conference in September, there were multiple new clinical data sets and presentations around Impella and unloading therapy. Following last year's physician-led cardiogenic shock call to arms, Dr. Bill O'Neill presented updated results from 104 patients in the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, NCSI.
After more than 20 years of stagnant shock survival rates at roughly 50%, NCSI has now demonstrated a survival of 77% with 99% of survivors discharged home with their native heart. More than 56 U.S. hospitals have now joined the NCSI initiative and momentum continues to grow. The importance of Impella and treatment protocols for shock patients was further validated with the presentation on the main stage at TCT, with new clinical data from the Impella Quality Assurance IQ commercial database. This analysis of 11,566 patients at all hospitals revealed that our efforts with training and data have improved mean survival rates across the nation from 51% to 63%, and the numbers of centers achieving survival rates greater than 70% has increased from 25% to 39% with utilization of best practice protocols.
This October, a new paper titled Cardiac Shock Care Centers was published in JACC and reiterated the need for AMI shock protocols. The publication references multiple studies, including NCSI and IQ and outlines a suggested shock care algorithm, stating that the rapid initiation of mechanical circulatory support is paramount.
This paper also addresses the IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump, stating that multiple trials have shown no survival benefit from the device and states that it is not recommended per their evidence-based shock care pathway algorithm. As a reminder, the intra-aortic balloon pump is Class III or considered harmful for cardiogenic shock in European and Japanese guidelines. 
Additionally, there is growing physician awareness of Impella's ability to protect against acute kidney injury, AKI. On our year-end call in May, we highlighted a clinical paper published in Circulation, showing the use of Impella for high-risk PCI patients and a significant reduction in the risk of AKI and need for a dialysis.
Two additional studies by Westenfeld at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany have replicated these results of AKI risk reduction with Impella support. These results also reinforce the Protect II RCT FDA study and match what we currently observe in our cVAD study. AKI remains a critical clinical challenge for heart failure patients and procedures such as PCI, CABG and TAVR.
Before closing, I would like to remind all investors that the STEMI DTU FDA safety and feasibility study will be presented in the late-breaking clinical trials at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time on November 11 at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Chicago. Since we recognize that many of our investors will not be attending, Abiomed will host a short call for investors on Monday, November 12 at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
In summary, we are executing our plan for sustainable growth, while helping to improve patient outcomes, focused on native heart recovery. Abiomed is concentrating on execution, with 10% penetration of U.S. patients with critical clinical need today for high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. It is also rewarding to see physician-led initiatives, aligning treatment goals and care pathways to improve patient outcomes.
We are confident in our future with Impella growth opportunities of several hundred thousand patients, with new and existing indications, new products and new geographies. No other company provides approved percutaneous heart pumps that unload the left and right ventricle and protect and recover heart muscle for elective, urgent and emergent patients. I am proud of our employees and appreciate their dedication to recovering hearts and saving lives, and I'm thankful to our customers and our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29",662,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29% increase in overall patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue was $24 million, up 67% versus last year due to the commercial launch in Japan and continued strength in Europe, which saw revenues increase 38% on a constant currency. We continue to be pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan, where revenue totaled $4.1 million for the quarter, as we opened up 14 new sites.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q2, the Impella 2.5 and CP have been placed at approximately 1,250 sites, while the Impella 5.0 and RP are at 559 and 368 sites, respectively. Reorder performance in the quarter was also strong, with a rate slightly above 100%, consistent with the prior quarter. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.2 units per site during the quarter as higher volume hospitals carried more inventory to support their cases.
In the second quarter, gross margin was 83.6%, relatively similar to last year. The benefit from higher volume was offset by manufacturing investments, such as direct labor hires to support our future growth. R&D expense for the quarter totaled $23 million, up 17% versus prior year. The increase was driven by investments for new products such as SmartAssist, the Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as for data collection related to our cVAD study. These investments will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the second quarter was $79 million, up 31% versus prior year. The increase was due to expansion of our commercial team, additional marketing and training programs, higher incentive compensation and support of our Japanese launch. We will continue to make these growth investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration in our top 3 targeted countries of the U.S., Germany and Japan.
In the second quarter, we delivered $50 million of operating income, an increase of 59% versus prior year. This translated into an operating margin of 27.7%, a Q2 record for the company. Our margin expanded 380 basis points over prior year due to higher volume, which more than offset our investments.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $50 million or $1.09 per diluted share, up 104% versus Q2 of '18. In the quarter, the company saw a benefit of approximately $13 million or $0.28 per share from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Normalizing the impact from excess tax benefits, EPS increased 84% versus Q2 of '18, mainly driven by strong operations and a lower effective tax rate.
Our balance sheet remains debt-free, and we ended the quarter with $410 million of cash and marketable securities. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Turning to guidance. Given our execution and a strong first half performance, we are, again, raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by $10 million to a new range of $765 million to $770 million, up 29% to 30% for the year.
The previous guidance, post Q1, was $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year. We expect to see solid growth in the second half, even as we start to lap some challenging comps, and we continue to train our field team at headquarters or within the region on existing and new products, expanded indications and updated clinical papers.
So in summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies, while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for 2019 and beyond.

For patients that have heart failure or advanced coronary disease, there is a correlation and link directly to heart failure with renal failure. If you look at the Protect II data, the randomized arm of Impella has a significantly more contrast, but had numerically lower renal failure than the intra-aortic balloon pump arm. And what you've seen prior to that is all studies show a direct correlation, more contrast yields to more renal failure. In the Mehran score, which is a accepted predictive risk score for AKI, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump actually adds to the risk, adds points, because of the way it is positioned in the designing of aorta as well its requirement of perfect timing. And with the Impella, we continue to see the -- some additional benefits of unloading but also in increasing urine production. Some physicians actually would call Impella a urine pump, and so we're going to continue to study it. We have RCT FDA data in Protect II. We have data from our cVAD study that was presented at TCT, showing, again, the predicted AKI rate is significantly cut and reduced with the use of Impella, both 2.5 and CP, and there's some interesting papers that are coming out of Europe by Westenfeld, which I commented on in my prepared remarks, showing that the use of Impella, again, significantly reduces the expected rate per the Mehran score and also 1 study that showed the use of ECMO significantly increased AKI. So there will be more studies to come, and we plan to see this continue to expand over the next 10 years because this is a significant problem in use of contrast for PCI. It is a significant problem for TAVR. I believe the TAVR AKI rate is around 25% to 30%, again, because there's a correlation with heart failure, and it's definitely a problem with CABG. So a great opportunity for us, and we're going to maintain studies and continue to publish on AKI for a long time."

So first, let me frame it with the amount of data that we have coming in. We have the IQ Database, which is nearly 95% of our commercial patients where we get outcomes to X plant, and we also collect high-level data, and we're expanding that to be able to analyze protocols for both, basically high-risk PCI and then shock, whether it's from AMI or cardiomyopathy. So we've got a plethora of data coming in. We then have the cVAD and you used the term registry, used to be called the cVAD registry study. We actually dropped the word registry at TCT because we've converted now -- the cVAD study is a prospective IRB-approved study, ongoing at a select number of centers for all patients, all indications and all products, and that allows us then to look at both unique uses in collect data and potentially allow us to expand our label. And we've embedded 5 post-market studies inside the cVAD study, and we'll continue those studies indefinitely. And so this gives us basically the world's largest database of patients that are having heart failure that need hemodynamic support. And we think that the current product, the Impella 5.5, which is approved in Europe, is really going to be a great product to look at those patients that may want to ambulate, do have the ability to wean off, come off inotropes. And the algorithms we're now developing on the console and with the fiber-optic sensor is we can see what's happening as you wean the pump down, because it's a forward flow pump, you introduce pulsatility. And as you wean it down, you can see on the console if the left ventricle has the ability to recover. Because if you're taking the pump down and you see the cardiac output maintain or go up, you know the heart can reload. And because we now have Impella Connect with the fiber-optic sensor, we're able to real-time monitor those patients, and that will give us the ability as these patients -- as we develop more protocols and algorithms allow these patients a little bit longer time and be in place with the axillary artery. They can be mobile, ambulate, walk around. And we're really going to then develop these protocols around weaning patients, which is not something you can do with implantable VADs because of the way they're implanted and how they core out the ventricle. So we are very excited. The target population that we're focused on for those advanced studies in the future will be around cardiomyopathy shock and will continue to look at patients that may be more Class III, that are not interested in a transplant or are not yet sick enough. And what we'll try to do is get them back to baseline and match it with adjunctive therapies in the future, new drugs or stem cells or immunosuppression therapy. So it's going to have a long runway. And again, the innovation of this platform is it allows us to unload the ventricle, reduce the work, increase coronary flow and profuse the rest of the body and support the end organs, especially the kidneys."

Those are the top 3 markets in the world for medtech. And if we can establish Impella as the standard of care there, it has a great influence and allows us to spread to these other countries. What we look for is the physician societies with the government to recognize that Impella is a new therapy, that it's an unloading therapy, and it has the ability to enable native heart recovery. That's been done and that's been accepted in the U.S., in Germany and in Japan, and we'll continue to make sure that we can improve the efforts. And in some of these countries, we launch with our best practice protocols. As we start to go into these -- this next range of countries out there, we do that with the newer technology. We'll look to have the Impella Connect as a standard in the future. So as places are expanding, we'll be able to monitor those patients and ensure the protocols and the treatment matches what we see in the U.S., Germany and Japan. And we'll be able to continue to publish and collect data around native heart recovery. In other countries, transplants or implantable LVADs are not an option, and recovery always remains the most cost-effective solution, and that's where we continue to invest in the training and education. And so from a distribution and investment perspective, we now have an organization that's dedicated to developing and planting new seeds. As we've announced, we have cases and patients being done in Australia and India and several other countries, but we're going to do it under our current plan, which is to get a commitment from, again, the countries on what Impella is and what heart recovery therapy can enable. And by doing that, we'll invest go direct, so we can ensure we get the best outcomes in the ICU."

In healthcare, you've got the regulatory and the clinical barriers, but what's been shown to be the #1 driver of adoption is really getting the FDA approval and getting some guideline attention. And so this paper I referenced in JACC that's the Cardiac Shock Care Centers, is really a fantastic paper because it's going through and outlining the limitations of the outcomes over the last 20 years. And in U.S. hospitals today, sites that are getting 50% survival are matching what's been done over the last 20 years. And the sites that have adopted these best practice protocols, they can get upwards of 70% survival, but, most important, nearly all of these patients recover the native heart. They are discharged home with their own heart with the quality of life that is acceptable. And in other prior studies, even if 50% metric or number that's thrown out, there's no mention of whether the patients are in hospice care or die 6 months later or Class IV heart failure patients. So this is also why the STEMI education is so important, because if you look at STEMI patients that don't go into shock, that live, again, 70% of them are in heart failure within 5 years. And I think the -- in Europe and with -- in Germany and Japan, the intra-aortic balloon pump is already deemed Class III, and this recent paper and some of the momentum we're seeing from NCSI is really highlighting the fact that 50% survival for shock patients is unacceptable, and we can do better.

And so we approach that concern with education, and we point out that TAVR started at 22, and is now 14, and it's a skill set that many of them have and they've overcome it. We point out that in Protect II, the intra-aortic balloon pump had numerically higher vascular complications than the Impella, and the Impella showed continued improvement throughout the study. And because of this experience and TAVR, access and closure technologies have advanced and continued to improve our outcomes. You'll see from the data presented at AHA what happens in an updated study with patients that are somewhat unstable with heart attacks and how they -- how safe and feasible that is with Impella. And we do have some new technology that has to do with expandable sheets for the CP. And remember, the CP has a 9 French catheter, and that's really the driver of leg ischemia. It's not necessarily the hole. So outside of all the education and everything we're doing, it's a very simple discussion with interventional cardiologists, if he can have a 9 French 4 liter pump to help them do Protected PCI. So there is great interest, excitement and demand. We do think it's -- it will be ideal for Protected PCI, and we think the CP will be ideal for shock patients because its ability to have a motor onboard, produce the truest flow, measure cardiac power and output and help wean the patient off. And then, of course, we think the 5.5 will really be a tremendous pump for patients that want to get up and walk around to have full flow and have the ability to wean off, especially those cardiomyopathy shock patients. So lots to come, but the ECP is a breakthrough product, and we're so excited to get to our first-in-man."

In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock",1060,"Thank you, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. In Q2, Abiomed delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $182 million, up 37% year-over-year and an operating margin of 27.7%. U.S. patient utilization increased 30% in Protected PCI and cardiogenic shock. On a constant currency basis, European revenue increased 38%, while German revenue was up 33%. In Japan, our business continues to perform very well, delivering $4.1 million in revenue, with 35 hospitals trained and 83 hospitals approved by the government.
Abiomed is positioned for sustainable growth and building the field of heart recovery with disciplined execution. We have established a strong foundation with our innovation, technology, balance sheet and intellectual property portfolio. As a result, we're following our Impella adoption formula of training, data and time.
It was highly evident at TCT that Abiomed is improving training and education with SmartAssist, Impella Connect and with clinical data presented from the IQ, Impella Quality Assurance Database, cVAD and NCSI. We're also significantly investing in our products and analyzing real-time clinical data to identify best practices for weaning within hospital protocols. And we continue to collaborate on education with physician-led initiatives, like NCSI, TEACH and CHIP.
For today's call, I will highlight continued validation of Impella hemodynamic support with best practices for patients in cardiogenic shock and the new data on the potential to reduce the risk of AKI, acute kidney injury, for high-risk PCI procedures. 
The best validation of the Impella therapy starts with the story of patients like Libby McKean. Libby, a 52-year-old woman from Ohio, suffered a heart attack while driving and crashed into a cornfield near her home. Her in-car emergency system notified first responders of the crash, and upon arrival, EMTs worked to resuscitate Libby with defibrillization and CPR as they rushed her to Lima Memorial Hospital in Lima, Ohio.
Dr. Zane Dean, an interventional cardiologist, quickly identified cardiogenic shock and an emergent need for hemodynamic support. He inserted the Impella CP to stabilize Libby in the cath lab, while placing stents to restore coronary blood flow. Libby remained on Impella support for 2 days and was successfully weaned off of the device. 
Libby was discharged home after 10 days with her native heart and with a near-normal ejection fraction of approximately 50% to 55%. This is another example of an unresponsive patient in cardiogenic shock and stresses the benefit of shock protocols to improve outcomes.
This is another example of both survival and native heart recovery and the impact to the patient's quality of life and cost effectiveness. Libby avoided the cascade of the most invasive and expensive products and procedures in cardiovascular care.
At the TC Conference in September, there were multiple new clinical data sets and presentations around Impella and unloading therapy. Following last year's physician-led cardiogenic shock call to arms, Dr. Bill O'Neill presented updated results from 104 patients in the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, NCSI.
After more than 20 years of stagnant shock survival rates at roughly 50%, NCSI has now demonstrated a survival of 77% with 99% of survivors discharged home with their native heart. More than 56 U.S. hospitals have now joined the NCSI initiative and momentum continues to grow. The importance of Impella and treatment protocols for shock patients was further validated with the presentation on the main stage at TCT, with new clinical data from the Impella Quality Assurance IQ commercial database. This analysis of 11,566 patients at all hospitals revealed that our efforts with training and data have improved mean survival rates across the nation from 51% to 63%, and the numbers of centers achieving survival rates greater than 70% has increased from 25% to 39% with utilization of best practice protocols.
This October, a new paper titled Cardiac Shock Care Centers was published in JACC and reiterated the need for AMI shock protocols. The publication references multiple studies, including NCSI and IQ and outlines a suggested shock care algorithm, stating that the rapid initiation of mechanical circulatory support is paramount.
This paper also addresses the IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump, stating that multiple trials have shown no survival benefit from the device and states that it is not recommended per their evidence-based shock care pathway algorithm. As a reminder, the intra-aortic balloon pump is Class III or considered harmful for cardiogenic shock in European and Japanese guidelines. 
Additionally, there is growing physician awareness of Impella's ability to protect against acute kidney injury, AKI. On our year-end call in May, we highlighted a clinical paper published in Circulation, showing the use of Impella for high-risk PCI patients and a significant reduction in the risk of AKI and need for a dialysis.
Two additional studies by Westenfeld at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany have replicated these results of AKI risk reduction with Impella support. These results also reinforce the Protect II RCT FDA study and match what we currently observe in our cVAD study. AKI remains a critical clinical challenge for heart failure patients and procedures such as PCI, CABG and TAVR.
Before closing, I would like to remind all investors that the STEMI DTU FDA safety and feasibility study will be presented in the late-breaking clinical trials at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time on November 11 at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Chicago. Since we recognize that many of our investors will not be attending, Abiomed will host a short call for investors on Monday, November 12 at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
In summary, we are executing our plan for sustainable growth, while helping to improve patient outcomes, focused on native heart recovery. Abiomed is concentrating on execution, with 10% penetration of U.S. patients with critical clinical need today for high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. It is also rewarding to see physician-led initiatives, aligning treatment goals and care pathways to improve patient outcomes.
We are confident in our future with Impella growth opportunities of several hundred thousand patients, with new and existing indications, new products and new geographies. No other company provides approved percutaneous heart pumps that unload the left and right ventricle and protect and recover heart muscle for elective, urgent and emergent patients. I am proud of our employees and appreciate their dedication to recovering hearts and saving lives, and I'm thankful to our customers and our shareholders for their continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29",662,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $182 million, an increase of $49 million or 37% versus last year, with solid performance across all geographies. U.S. revenue rose 33% to $158 million, driven by a 29% increase in overall patient utilization.
Outside the U.S., revenue was $24 million, up 67% versus last year due to the commercial launch in Japan and continued strength in Europe, which saw revenues increase 38% on a constant currency. We continue to be pleased with our controlled rollout in Japan, where revenue totaled $4.1 million for the quarter, as we opened up 14 new sites.
In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q2, the Impella 2.5 and CP have been placed at approximately 1,250 sites, while the Impella 5.0 and RP are at 559 and 368 sites, respectively. Reorder performance in the quarter was also strong, with a rate slightly above 100%, consistent with the prior quarter. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.2 units per site during the quarter as higher volume hospitals carried more inventory to support their cases.
In the second quarter, gross margin was 83.6%, relatively similar to last year. The benefit from higher volume was offset by manufacturing investments, such as direct labor hires to support our future growth. R&D expense for the quarter totaled $23 million, up 17% versus prior year. The increase was driven by investments for new products such as SmartAssist, the Impella 5.5, ECP and BTR as well as for data collection related to our cVAD study. These investments will lay the groundwork for improving clinical outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the second quarter was $79 million, up 31% versus prior year. The increase was due to expansion of our commercial team, additional marketing and training programs, higher incentive compensation and support of our Japanese launch. We will continue to make these growth investments as we are still in the early stages of market penetration in our top 3 targeted countries of the U.S., Germany and Japan.
In the second quarter, we delivered $50 million of operating income, an increase of 59% versus prior year. This translated into an operating margin of 27.7%, a Q2 record for the company. Our margin expanded 380 basis points over prior year due to higher volume, which more than offset our investments.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $50 million or $1.09 per diluted share, up 104% versus Q2 of '18. In the quarter, the company saw a benefit of approximately $13 million or $0.28 per share from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Normalizing the impact from excess tax benefits, EPS increased 84% versus Q2 of '18, mainly driven by strong operations and a lower effective tax rate.
Our balance sheet remains debt-free, and we ended the quarter with $410 million of cash and marketable securities. Our top priority for cash remains to support organic growth initiatives and to continue to build our intellectual property advantage.
Turning to guidance. Given our execution and a strong first half performance, we are, again, raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance by $10 million to a new range of $765 million to $770 million, up 29% to 30% for the year.
The previous guidance, post Q1, was $755 million to $770 million, up 27% to 30% for the year. We expect to see solid growth in the second half, even as we start to lap some challenging comps, and we continue to train our field team at headquarters or within the region on existing and new products, expanded indications and updated clinical papers.
So in summary, we continue to execute across all markets and geographies, while making the necessary investments to support our growth objectives. We are well positioned to deliver our plan for 2019 and beyond.

We, again, raised the low end of the range for the second time at the end of Q2 by another $10 million, again, in line with past practices. So we do have some new hires in the field that we'll continue to train either at headquarters or within the region on our new products like SmartAssist, new indications and new clinical publications. As you mentioned, I do think it is worth noting that we do have some tougher comps as we head into the second half of the year. But listen, at the end of the day, if we hit the top end of our guidance range, this will be the fourth consecutive year of 30-plus percent top line growth. And I don't think there's too many companies out there that have demonstrated this type of consistent performance. So again, we'll continue to grow at a pace that we think is sustainable, and our goal is to remain one of the fastest-growing, most profitable medtech companies in the market. So we'll revisit the guidance at the end of Q3, and we'll adjust if necessary."

For patients that have heart failure or advanced coronary disease, there is a correlation and link directly to heart failure with renal failure. If you look at the Protect II data, the randomized arm of Impella has a significantly more contrast, but had numerically lower renal failure than the intra-aortic balloon pump arm. And what you've seen prior to that is all studies show a direct correlation, more contrast yields to more renal failure. In the Mehran score, which is a accepted predictive risk score for AKI, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump actually adds to the risk, adds points, because of the way it is positioned in the designing of aorta as well its requirement of perfect timing. And with the Impella, we continue to see the -- some additional benefits of unloading but also in increasing urine production. Some physicians actually would call Impella a urine pump, and so we're going to continue to study it. We have RCT FDA data in Protect II. We have data from our cVAD study that was presented at TCT, showing, again, the predicted AKI rate is significantly cut and reduced with the use of Impella, both 2.5 and CP, and there's some interesting papers that are coming out of Europe by Westenfeld, which I commented on in my prepared remarks, showing that the use of Impella, again, significantly reduces the expected rate per the Mehran score and also 1 study that showed the use of ECMO significantly increased AKI. So there will be more studies to come, and we plan to see this continue to expand over the next 10 years because this is a significant problem in use of contrast for PCI. It is a significant problem for TAVR. I believe the TAVR AKI rate is around 25% to 30%, again, because there's a correlation with heart failure, and it's definitely a problem with CABG. So a great opportunity for us, and we're going to maintain studies and continue to publish on AKI for a long time."

So first, let me frame it with the amount of data that we have coming in. We have the IQ Database, which is nearly 95% of our commercial patients where we get outcomes to X plant, and we also collect high-level data, and we're expanding that to be able to analyze protocols for both, basically high-risk PCI and then shock, whether it's from AMI or cardiomyopathy. So we've got a plethora of data coming in. We then have the cVAD and you used the term registry, used to be called the cVAD registry study. We actually dropped the word registry at TCT because we've converted now -- the cVAD study is a prospective IRB-approved study, ongoing at a select number of centers for all patients, all indications and all products, and that allows us then to look at both unique uses in collect data and potentially allow us to expand our label. And we've embedded 5 post-market studies inside the cVAD study, and we'll continue those studies indefinitely. And so this gives us basically the world's largest database of patients that are having heart failure that need hemodynamic support. And we think that the current product, the Impella 5.5, which is approved in Europe, is really going to be a great product to look at those patients that may want to ambulate, do have the ability to wean off, come off inotropes. And the algorithms we're now developing on the console and with the fiber-optic sensor is we can see what's happening as you wean the pump down, because it's a forward flow pump, you introduce pulsatility. And as you wean it down, you can see on the console if the left ventricle has the ability to recover. Because if you're taking the pump down and you see the cardiac output maintain or go up, you know the heart can reload. And because we now have Impella Connect with the fiber-optic sensor, we're able to real-time monitor those patients, and that will give us the ability as these patients -- as we develop more protocols and algorithms allow these patients a little bit longer time and be in place with the axillary artery. They can be mobile, ambulate, walk around. And we're really going to then develop these protocols around weaning patients, which is not something you can do with implantable VADs because of the way they're implanted and how they core out the ventricle. So we are very excited. The target population that we're focused on for those advanced studies in the future will be around cardiomyopathy shock and will continue to look at patients that may be more Class III, that are not interested in a transplant or are not yet sick enough. And what we'll try to do is get them back to baseline and match it with adjunctive therapies in the future, new drugs or stem cells or immunosuppression therapy. So it's going to have a long runway. And again, the innovation of this platform is it allows us to unload the ventricle, reduce the work, increase coronary flow and profuse the rest of the body and support the end organs, especially the kidneys."

Those are the top 3 markets in the world for medtech. And if we can establish Impella as the standard of care there, it has a great influence and allows us to spread to these other countries. What we look for is the physician societies with the government to recognize that Impella is a new therapy, that it's an unloading therapy, and it has the ability to enable native heart recovery. That's been done and that's been accepted in the U.S., in Germany and in Japan, and we'll continue to make sure that we can improve the efforts. And in some of these countries, we launch with our best practice protocols. As we start to go into these -- this next range of countries out there, we do that with the newer technology. We'll look to have the Impella Connect as a standard in the future. So as places are expanding, we'll be able to monitor those patients and ensure the protocols and the treatment matches what we see in the U.S., Germany and Japan. And we'll be able to continue to publish and collect data around native heart recovery. In other countries, transplants or implantable LVADs are not an option, and recovery always remains the most cost-effective solution, and that's where we continue to invest in the training and education. And so from a distribution and investment perspective, we now have an organization that's dedicated to developing and planting new seeds. As we've announced, we have cases and patients being done in Australia and India and several other countries, but we're going to do it under our current plan, which is to get a commitment from, again, the countries on what Impella is and what heart recovery therapy can enable. And by doing that, we'll invest go direct, so we can ensure we get the best outcomes in the ICU."

In healthcare, you've got the regulatory and the clinical barriers, but what's been shown to be the #1 driver of adoption is really getting the FDA approval and getting some guideline attention. And so this paper I referenced in JACC that's the Cardiac Shock Care Centers, is really a fantastic paper because it's going through and outlining the limitations of the outcomes over the last 20 years. And in U.S. hospitals today, sites that are getting 50% survival are matching what's been done over the last 20 years. And the sites that have adopted these best practice protocols, they can get upwards of 70% survival, but, most important, nearly all of these patients recover the native heart. They are discharged home with their own heart with the quality of life that is acceptable. And in other prior studies, even if 50% metric or number that's thrown out, there's no mention of whether the patients are in hospice care or die 6 months later or Class IV heart failure patients. So this is also why the STEMI education is so important, because if you look at STEMI patients that don't go into shock, that live, again, 70% of them are in heart failure within 5 years. And I think the -- in Europe and with -- in Germany and Japan, the intra-aortic balloon pump is already deemed Class III, and this recent paper and some of the momentum we're seeing from NCSI is really highlighting the fact that 50% survival for shock patients is unacceptable, and we can do better.

Again, it talks about what's happening to these patients with reperfusion injury, and there's another great paper from The New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 by Derek Yellon, which gives the mechanisms of the disease of myocardial reperfusion injury. So that reperfusion injury has been around a long time. It's well accepted. And what's happening is that, while opening up the blocked coronary within 90 minutes has improved survival, we're really studying the effect of what happens after survival, what's happening with the myocardium, and is there a better way to enhance and augment better survival with reduction of infarct. So we're excited for that presentation, and you'll hear a lot more details at that meeting and on the call on Monday."

We point out that in Protect II, the intra-aortic balloon pump had numerically higher vascular complications than the Impella, and the Impella showed continued improvement throughout the study. And because of this experience and TAVR, access and closure technologies have advanced and continued to improve our outcomes. You'll see from the data presented at AHA what happens in an updated study with patients that are somewhat unstable with heart attacks and how they -- how safe and feasible that is with Impella. And we do have some new technology that has to do with expandable sheets for the CP. And remember, the CP has a 9 French catheter, and that's really the driver of leg ischemia. It's not necessarily the hole.

We do think it's -- it will be ideal for Protected PCI, and we think the CP will be ideal for shock patients because its ability to have a motor onboard, produce the truest flow, measure cardiac power and output and help wean the patient off. And then, of course, we think the 5.5 will really be a tremendous pump for patients that want to get up and walk around to have full flow and have the ability to wean off, especially those cardiomyopathy shock patients. So lots to come, but the ECP is a breakthrough product, and we're so excited to get to our first-in-man."
