Good morning, everyone. 2017 ended on a strong note with growth across every major end market as the industrial economy steadily recovered. The discipline and focus of our entire employee base enabled us to capitalize on these trends while simultaneously making progress toward the merger with Linde. In fact, on Slide 4, you will find some specific examples of successful execution of our strategy. 
We presented this strategy approximately 3 years ago as commodity prices, emerging markets and industrial activity were collectively in decline. Our goal was to optimize the base business, capture quality growth opportunities and position the company for strong recovery when industrial markets improve, and I'm proud to say that the Praxair team has delivered. 
Over the last several years, we have taken actions to optimize the base business, which have culminated to record for both operating and free cash flow in 2017. Matt will discuss the numbers in more detail, but all of our employees contributed toward creating shareholder value and making our organization more efficient. 
While optimizing the base, we never took our eye off growing the business. And while the market conditions over the last few years, we focused our efforts on those sectors that were less cyclical or had fundamental cost advantages where our customers were making capital investments. Our resilient market exposure has grown double digits from roughly a quarter to 28% of the global portfolio. Furthermore, we have taken additional efforts to diversify and enhance the business portfolio through adding other nonindustrial projects to our backlog. These efforts are supported by recent announcements of contract wins for on-site customers, including nitrogen supply and processed gases to ever displays AMOLED manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In fact, as of now, electronic customers comprise roughly 10% of our project backlog versus just 2% last year. And that number will grow in light of new wins we expect in the coming months. 
In addition to portfolio management, we invested in strategic markets through acquisitions and joint ventures. Leveraging our extensive supply network and processed gas expertise in the U.S. Gulf Coast enabled us to secure $1.1 billion worth of new projects, and we're not done yet. I fully expect more key wins in the coming quarters as we continue to see strong investments around the low-cost hydrocarbons. All of these efforts support future growth independent of the macroeconomic environment. 
But as macro conditions improve, we fully expect to leverage any cyclical recovery as shown at the bottom of this page. And based on what we've seen over the last several months, I believe we are in the midst of an industrial recovery, especially in the U.S. and parts of Asia and Europe. We have positioned the business well to participate in this rebound while maintaining focus to run a high-quality business. This is evidenced by recent growth trends from the business segments. 
But we also want to see margins expanding with this recovery. While sequentially our margins have improved, we're lagging a bit from prior year. However, I fully expect margin expansion in 2018, which we are already experiencing in the first quarter. 
While executing the strategy, we also made significant progress toward the merger of Linde. I wasn't planning to cover what has already been completed, but suffice to say, it was a tremendous amount of work that our employees successfully managed while we continue to run the business at a high level. 
That being said, I would like to provide an update on key milestones, which you will find on Slide 5. The takeaway of this entire slide is that we're on track. Regulatory filings are being completed as expected, including the recently filed form CO with the European Commission. In parallel, we're making good progress on the divestiture process. I expect bid packages to be distributed over the next few weeks. After which, we will narrow the potential buyer pool. We will also take advantage of this time to accomplish as much integration planning work as we can to ensure a smooth transition post close. 
So overall, we've made good progress. While we can't control the final outcome, we've had very constructive dialogues with the regulators, and milestones are being achieved according to the plan. I'm sure many of you will have questions about the merger, but realize, there isn't much more I can say about the process or time line other than these points. 
Before I hand it over to Matt, I'd like to provide a brief update of business trends on Slide 6. North America, at 52% of sales, has seen growth across all end markets, but more specifically, strong recovery in the industrial sectors. In the last few months, U.S. industrial production growth for manufacturing has exceeded 2%, and key subsectors of metal fabrication and machinery have grown mid-single digits. This has led to robust growth in our on-site customers for metals, downstream energy and chemicals as well as manufacturing for our packaged gas business. 
Same-store sales hardgoods grew in the high teens and gas in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We also saw a substantial amount of capital equipment sales in the U.S., which may bode well for future industrial and infrastructure activity. Additionally, the chemicals market is growing double digits, while our metals customers continue to perform well as reductions in global steel capacity and improved trade balances have supported domestic production. Our confidence remains high in adding new projects to the backlog from the U.S. Gulf Coast as we are finalizing contract negotiations on a few large projects. 
Energy markets are also growing double-digit in North America, but mostly driven by downstream refining. Our customers ran quite hard in the fourth quarter as they rebounded quickly from the hurricanes, but we anticipate a significant turnaround season in this first quarter as several customer outages were deferred in 2017. 
While oil pricing has rebounded, there hasn't been a meaningful uptick in our upstream business. Mexico has bounced off of the low rates, and we are seeing slow improvement in the U.S., but most customers are still operating in the lowest-cost regions using slickwater techniques that don't require very much nitrogen. If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gases, but we aren't -- but we just aren't seeing much of that yet. 
South America, at 13% of our sales, has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved with low to mid-single-digit IP growth over the last few months. Most end markets have been flat to up, although manufacturing and metals have grown more than other sectors, which may signal some falling of industrial investments. 
I wish I could say that I'm bullish for recovery, but the uncertainty around the political situation in Brazil will likely result in a continued hold on investments. So at this point, I'm not expecting much from Brazil for the first half of 2018. 
On the bright side, Argentina continues to be a good growth story, and the commodity rebound should help countries like Chile and Peru, but time will tell on the pace of the Brazilian recovery. 
Similar to the other regions, Europe has grown in all end markets, but most in the industrial areas of metals and manufacturing. Germany, Italy and Spain have all contributed nicely to the growth in segment sales and profits. However, the Nordics and Russia are still lagging on performance just given their local economies. But overall, Europe continues to be a positive story. 
Asia, at 16% of sales, has been our strongest growth story for the year, both organically and for new on-site contracts for the project backlog. Double-digit volume growth in chemicals, electronics, manufacturing and metals have contributed to the results. As the Chinese economy rationalizes excess production capacity in key markets like steel, we have benefited from a combination of being partnered with the right on-site customers and improved supply-demand balance in the merchant liquid market. Pricing has improved several quarters in a row as pent-up inflation is working through the supply chain. In China, and more specifically, Korea, we continue to see significant on-site opportunities around electronics, primarily high-purity nitrogen, but also other processed gas is used in fabs. 
In 2017, we announced 3 new projects serving the electronics industry, and there are more to come. In fact, we were recently awarded a very large project, which I expect will be announced shortly. The opportunity set for new projects in Asia, especially electronics, has been quite strong, but we continue to maintain our discipline to only partner with the right customers and terms that fit our risk-reward criteria. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk through the numbers."

Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance, and you can see that volume is the largest contributor with 7% and 1% growth from last year and third quarter, respectively. When comparing to prior year, every major end market expanded, led by electronics, chemicals and energy. 
From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the greatest growth from a combination of recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, about 2/3 came from organic volume with the rest supported by project startups. The 1% sequential growth was also supported by U.S. and Asia as the U.S. Gulf Coast recovered from the third quarter hurricanes, and we saw general improvement in manufacturing activity in both regions. 
South America was seasonally weak as expected due to the holidays and summer break. End market trends were also consistent with expectations as the energy market rebounded from U.S. Gulf Coast was partially offset by seasonally weaker beverage sales in the northern hemisphere.
The price/mix improvement of 1% was achieved from focused pricing actions, partially offset by some unfavorable mix impacts in specific regions, especially in South America and Europe. 
Asian merchant liquid had the strongest performance of the segments, while pricing action in North America were partially offset by the effect of higher capital equipment sales in our packaged gas business. 
Currency translation is favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean won. 
Operating profit of $653 million is $54 million or 9% better than last year and $11 million or 2% better than the third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter in a row where we have expanded operating margins. However, it is lower by 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. About 20 basis points relates to the impact of higher cost pass-through, so the underlying margin decline from Q4 2016 is about 40 basis points. 
There are 3 main drivers negatively affecting this. First is the unfavorable mix issues we discussed, including capital equipment sales in overall South America; second relates to restructuring charges embedded in the results, which you can see in the other income trends; and third relates to the fact that fourth quarter of 2016 had a lower run rate SG&A as we had to reverse some of the incentive compensation accruals last year due to weaker results. But that is 1 [ quarter ] comparison in time, and several of these items will not repeat. As Steve mentioned, we are quite confident that we will be expanding margins in 2018, including the first quarter. 
More importantly, our operating cash flow margins have increased for 3 straight years to a record 27% in 2017, which I'll speak to on the next slide. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve with strong capital management and cash generation. Return on capital has steadily risen each quarter, reaching 12.5% by year-end. I expect that number to continue to improve throughout 2018. Our available operating cash flow, which represents operating cash flow minus nonbacklog or what we call base CapEx, has grown to almost $600 million for the quarter as we've managed base CapEx and also increased operating cash flow. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for more details on our cash flow performance. The left part of this slide provides a multiyear trend for operating and free cash flow. A few things that I'd like to point out. First, you can see that 2017 represented a record for both metrics. This result is a culmination of many efforts from our employees around the world. Second, free cash flow has steadily increased over the period as the organization managed capital spending in line with the underlying growth prospects. Finally, the quality of the business has also steadily increased as operating cash flow margins have improved from 19% to 27%. Said differently, in 2017, for every $1 of sales, we generated $0.27 of operating cash flow that we could either return to shareholders or invest for future growth. This is a very compelling story of both the resiliency of our business as well as the ability to leverage a recovery like we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The right part of this slide shows how we used the $3 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, resulting in a balance of growth investments, shareholder returns and debt reduction. We are currently pausing stock repurchases during the proposed merger, so I anticipate further declines in net debt leading up to close. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for tax and guidance update. In the fourth quarter, we booked a tax reform charge of $394 million or $1.36 of EPS. This charge is comprised of 3 pieces: a $467 million charge for the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; a $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriated foreign earnings; and a $333 million benefit associated with the revaluation of a deferred tax liability from 35% to 21%. There is no immediate cash impact from this charge, but cash will be impacted over several years as the liabilities are settled. This charge represents our best estimate of the current tax reform, but it is subject to change as new information becomes available. 
Looking forward, I anticipate the new tax reform will lower our current effective tax rate down to a range of 23% to 25%, depending upon how specific aspects of the reform are ultimately clarified by the U.S. Treasury Department. For purposes of guidance, we are assuming a tax rate near the middle of that range, which provides a quarterly benefit of approximately $0.05 when compared to our run rate. 
As far as guidance, the EPS estimate for the first quarter is in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, which includes the $0.05 for tax reform. First quarter is seasonally slower due to Lunar New Year and Carnival. Furthermore, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are undergoing a significant amount of turnarounds as several slated for 2017 were deferred into this quarter. Despite these known headwinds, we're expecting continued contribution from underlying price and volume, which will improve operating leverage. 
We did not provide a full year guidance range in light of the anticipated merger close date. As such, we do not expect Praxair will finish 2018 as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Our focus is to continue operating at a high-level performance while supporting the merger integration planning efforts for a successful start to Linde plc. We believe it is more appropriate to provide quarterly guidance for Praxair as the focus shifts to the new combined company in the second half of the year. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I think metal export is up a little bit. Pulp and paper is up some. Agriculture is always fairly strong. But really, the base manufacturing, core manufacturing sector has not seen that yet. And again, I think we heard some what I'll call good news that the past president's conviction was upheld a couple of days ago. So he won't be a factor in the elections, and he had a lot of popular support. But there's still going to be some volatility in the political climate. But to get back and answer your question, we've run as high as 22, 23 in years past. So our objective begins to get it back to 20."

And most of what's driving that number is China, just to be specific. So you've heard me talk about China in the past where we were really unhappy with the level of pricing, and there were several factors at play. There was excess supply in the merchant liquid market. You had captive steel companies and so forth putting byproduct market on into the supply. So what has changed, there's really a couple of things, and one of, which is if you look at the merchant liquid capacity utilization today and that's usually a question I get somewhere along the line, I mean, we're in the 90s in terms of capacity utilization. And we're not alone in terms of the fact that given the growth, and there hasn't been the pace of merchant liquid capacity adds that we used to see in the past that, that market has tightened up. But that's a good thing. And then the second thing was in my comments was trying is very serious about managing the environment. They realized they had overcapacity in many sectors, one of which was metals. Again, that's where we saw a lot of excess product come into the market. So as those Tier 2, Tier 3 metals customers are rationalized, then that product doesn't find its way into the market, which is a good thing. So those are some factors that are playing. And yes, I do expect this to continue."

And I give an example formation that we would see lift in would be the San Juan basin, for example, in New Mexico. So I would expect some improvement. Wouldn't we get all the way back to 4? I'm not sure about that. It would certainly be a nice bonus for us going forward in terms of our earnings boost. You got to keep in mind, we sold a lot of nitrogen for oil pressurization for maintenance to PEMEX, and they still have a lot of problems. And I'd said they'd bounce off of their bottom, but they're nowhere near their peak. And again, energy prices have moved up quite a bit. So they have issues managing the budget, but they also need to maintain their wells. And they're constantly trying to balance that. So yes, it would be nice to see. Will we get back to the 4% level?

So I think the outlook with respect to projects is trending positively, mainly driven by those 2 areas. And of course, with respect to the merger, I think that's a question that's better left for Linde to opine on. But if you look at what they've been talking about with respect to their engineering business, the fact that the backlog is strong, they've been adding projects to it. I think that speaks for itself.

And again, we didn't deliberately give guidance too far out. But as I'm looking at, we talked about the first quarter.

Call currency 0, pass-through 0, then what's left is price and mix, but let's say price and volume. We think price is going to be in the 1%, trending to 2% kind of level. That's our objective. And then in terms of volume, we had some good growth obviously in Q4. We think that trend is going to continue. Of course, you have some seasonal effects that Matt talked about, which can't -- don't change and the heavy turnarounds at Haikou. But year-over-year, we're going to see some volume growth. So we believe that top line is going to be in the mid-single-digit range, maybe in the upper end of the mid-single-digit range. And then we'll be able to leverage the margins up from that into the high single digits and perhaps push in double digits."

If I look around at other parts of the world, you still have some regions that are in the 70s, some that are mid-70s. And so that situation really hasn't corrected itself yet. I would say, generally speaking, though we talk about Brazil going the other direction where they historically have high inflation, now they're low inflation, sub-3%, most parts of the world are seeing some inflation. I can look at Mexico, I can see some inflation. I can look at other parts where inflation is starting to become more of a factor. And so for us coming into the year, this is something we talk about at our leadership conference that we want to make sure we get out ahead of that inflation curve.

And probably half of that does relate to some of the incentive impact. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks in '16, we really reduced that number down quite low given the weaker performance and that we did not reach a lot of our targets. So you're looking at kind of a couple percent, I think, natural growth, which is in line, I think, with inflation, in line with what you'd expect to merit impact. And I see no reason why looking into '18 why that would be any different. So when I remove that variable component, which can go up and down, I think just kind of a low single-digit inflation like number is what we tend to see in normal years."

When you look at on an average run rate, I'd expect the cash benefits would probably be somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million per year range. But you have to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously, that's based on our current interpretation of the tax reform. Obviously, it could be very subject to change as clarifications come out. But right now, I would estimate it in that range of $50 million to $60 million. Obviously, that is slightly less than the earnings and that's due to the fact that with the upfront charge on the deemed repatriation, that won't be a factor in the ongoing earnings, but clearly, it'll be an effect on the cash. That all being said, for 2018, I don't expect any net impact because we are fully going to do some repatriation in this year. And withholding tax payments, we will make on a cash basis. I anticipate to completely offset any of the benefit, primarily due to the rate differential in the U.S. So 2018, no net cash impact. Average annual run rate, probably 50 to 60 based on current interpretation. But as you probably know on the deemed repatriation, that is a step-up formula for the cash. The first 5 years are at 8% of the obligation and then years 6, 7 and 8 step up to 15%, 20%, 25%. So after that 5-year run rate, the cash cost may go up a little higher and the benefit a little lower. But hopefully, that kind of gives you at least an understanding. And then as things change, if we need to update, we'll relook at that."

But really, demand is quite strong in the U.S. as many of you on the call would know. Chemicals volumes will be driven by just the growth in the U.S. economy, industrial production, resi production. And of course, they're advantaged from a natural gas standpoint. Looks like that will be a situation that will be sustained going forward. They'll have a natural gas feedstock advantage, and they're exporting now more than they used to. And that all drives demand for the chemicals, in particular in the U.S. Gulf Coast and volume for us."

Good morning, everyone. 2017 ended on a strong note, with growth across every major end market as the industrial economy steadily recovered. The discipline and focus of our entire employee base enabled us to capitalize on these trends while simultaneously making progress towards the merger with Linde. In fact, on Slide 4, you will find some specific examples of successful execution of our strategy. 
We presented this strategy approximately 3 years ago as commodity prices, emerging markets and industrial activity were collectively in decline. Our goal was to optimize the base business, capture quality growth opportunities and position the company for strong recovery when industrial markets improved. And I'm proud to say that the Praxair team has delivered. 
Over the last several years, we have taken actions to optimize the base business, which have culminated to record for both operating and free cash flow in 2017. Matt will discuss the numbers in more detail, but all of our employees contributed toward creating shareholder value and making our organization more efficient. 
While optimizing the base, we never took our eye off growing the business. In light of the market conditions of the last few years, we focused our efforts on those sectors that were less cyclical or had fundamental cost advantages where our customers were making capital investments. Our resilient market exposure has grown double digits from roughly 1/4 to 28% of the global portfolio. Furthermore, we have taken additional efforts to diversify and enhance the business portfolio through adding other nonindustrial projects to our backlog. These efforts are supported by recent announcements of contract wins for on-site customers, including nitrogen supply and process gases to Everdisplay's AMOLED manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In fact, as of now, electronic customers comprise roughly 10% of our project backlog versus just 2% last year. And that number will grow in light of new wins we expect in the coming months. 
In addition to portfolio management, we invested in strategic markets through acquisitions and joint ventures. Leveraging our extensive supply network and process gas expertise in the U.S. Gulf Coast enabled us to secure $1.1 billion worth of new projects, and we're not done yet. I fully expect more key wins in the coming quarters as we continue to see strong investments around the low-cost hydrocarbons. All of these efforts support future growth independent of the macroeconomic environment. 
But as macro conditions improve, we fully expect to leverage any cyclical recovery, as shown at the bottom of this page. And based on what we've seen over the last several months, I believe we are in the midst of an industrial recovery, especially in the U.S. and parts of Asia and Europe. We have positioned the business well to participate in this rebound while maintaining focused around our high-quality business. This is evidenced by recent growth trends from the business segments. 
But we also want to see margins expanding with this recovery. While sequentially, our margins have improved, we're lagging a bit from prior year. However, I fully expect margin expansion in 2018, which we are already experiencing in the first quarter. 
While executing the strategy, we also made significant progress toward the merger with Linde. I wasn't planning to cover what has already been completed, but suffice to say, it was a tremendous amount of work that our employees successfully managed while we continued to run the business at a high level. 
That being said, I would like to provide an update on key milestones, which you will find on Slide 5. The takeaway of this entire slide is that we're on track. Regulatory filings are being completed as expected, including the recently filed Form CO with the European Commission. In parallel, we're making good progress on the divestiture process. I expect bid packages to be distributed over the next few weeks, after which we will narrow the potential buyer pool. We will also take advantage of this time to accomplish as much integration planning work as we can to ensure a smooth transition post-close. 
So overall, we've made good progress. While we can't control the final outcome, we've had very constructive dialogues with the regulators, and milestones are being achieved according to the plan. I'm sure many of you will have questions about the merger, but realize there isn't much more I can say about the process or time line other than these points. 
Before I hand it over to Matt, I'd like to provide a brief update of business trends on Slide 6. North America at 52% of sales has seen growth across all end markets but, more specifically, strong recovery in the industrial sectors. In the last few months, U.S. industrial production growth for manufacturing has exceeded 2%, and key subsectors of metal fabrication and machinery have grown mid-single digits. This has led to robust growth in our on-site customers for metals, downstream energy and chemicals as well as manufacturing for our packaged gas business. 
Same-store sales. Hardgoods grew in the high teens and gas in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We also saw a substantial amount of capital equipment sales in the U.S., which may bode well for future industrial and infrastructure activity. Additionally, the chemicals market is growing double digits, while our metals customers continue to perform well as reductions in global steel capacity and improved trade balances have supported domestic production. Our confidence remains high in adding new projects to the backlog from the U.S. Gulf Coast as we are finalizing contract negotiations on a few large projects. 
Energy markets are also growing double digit in North America but mostly driven by downstream refining. Our customers ran quite hard in the fourth quarter as they rebounded quickly from the hurricanes, but we anticipate a significant turnaround season in this first quarter as several customer outages were deferred in 2017. 
While oil pricing has rebounded, there hasn't been a meaningful uptick in our upstream business. Mexico has bounced off the low rates, and we are seeing slow improvement in the U.S., but most customers are still operating in the lowest-cost regions using slickwater techniques that don't require very much nitrogen. If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gases, but we aren't -- but we just aren't seeing much of that yet. 
South America at 13% of our sales has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved, with low to mid-single-digit IP growth over the last few months. Most end markets have been flat to up, although manufacturing and metals have grown more than other sectors, which may signal some falling of industrial investments. I wish I could say that I am bullish for recovery, but the uncertainty around the political situation in Brazil will likely result in a continued hold on investments. So at this point, I'm not expecting much from Brazil for the first half of 2018. On the bright side, Argentina continues to be a good growth story, and the commodity rebound should help countries like Chile and Peru, but time will tell on the pace of the Brazilian recovery. 
Similar to the other regions, Europe has grown in all end markets but most in the industrial areas of metals and manufacturing. Germany, Italy and Spain have all contributed nicely to the growth in segment sales and profits. However, the Nordics and Russia are still lagging on performance just given their local economies. But overall, Europe continues to be a positive story. 
Asia at 16% of sales has been our strongest growth story for the year, both organically and for new on-site contracts for the project backlog. Double-digit volume growth in chemicals, electronics, manufacturing and metals have contributed to the results. As the Chinese economy rationalizes excess production capacity in key markets like steel, we have benefited from a combination of being partnered with the right on-site customers and improved supply-demand balance in the merchant liquid market. Pricing has improved several quarters in a row as pent-up inflation is working through the supply chain. In China and more specifically Korea, we continue to see significant on-site opportunities around electronics, primarily high-purity nitrogen but also other process gases used in fabs. 
In 2017, we announced 3 new projects serving the electronics industry, and there are more to come. In fact, we were recently awarded a very large project, which I expect will be announced shortly. The opportunity set for new projects in Asia, especially electronics, has been quite strong, but we continue to maintain our discipline to only partner with the right customers in terms that fit our risk-reward criteria. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk through the numbers."

Please turn to Slide 8 for our fourth quarter results. Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year.

Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance. And you can see that volume is the largest contributor, with 7% and 1% growth from last year and third quarter, respectively. When comparing to prior year, every major end market expanded, led by electronics, chemicals and energy. 
From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the greatest growth from a combination of recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, about 2/3 came from organic volume, with the rest supported by project start-ups. The 1% sequential growth was also supported by U.S. and Asia as the U.S. Gulf Coast recovered from the third quarter hurricanes, and we saw general improvement in manufacturing activity in both regions. 
South America was seasonally weak as expected due to the holidays and summer break. End market trends were also consistent with expectations. As the energy market rebounded from the U.S. Gulf Coast, it was partially offset by seasonally weaker beverage sales in the northern hemisphere. 
The price/mix improvement of 1% was achieved from focused pricing actions, partially offset by some unfavorable mix impacts in specific regions, especially in South America and Europe. Asian merchant liquid had the strongest performance of the segments, while pricing action in North America were partially offset by the effect of higher capital equipment sales in our packaged gas business. 
Currency translation is favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean won. 
Operating profit of $653 million is $54 million or 9% better than last year and $11 million or 2% better than the third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter in a row where we have expanded operating margins. However, it is lower by 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. About 20 basis points relates to the impact of higher cost pass-through, so the underlying margin decline from Q4 2016 is about 40 basis points. 
There are 3 main drivers negatively affecting this. First is the unfavorable mix issues we discussed, including capital equipment sales and overall South America. Second relates to restructuring charges embedded in the results, which you can see in the other income trends. And third relates to the fact that fourth quarter of 2016 had a lower run-rate SG&A as we had to reverse some of the incentive compensation accruals last year due to weaker results. But that is 1-quarter comparison in time, and several of these items will not repeat. As Steve mentioned, we are quite confident that we will be expanding margins in 2018, including the first quarter. More importantly, our operating cash flow margins have increased for 3 straight years to a record 27% in 2017, which I'll speak to on the next slide. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve with strong capital management and cash generation. Return on capital has steadily risen each quarter, reaching 12.5% by year-end. I expect that number to continue to improve throughout 2018. Our available operating cash flow, which represents operating cash flow minus non-backlog or what we call base CapEx, has grown to almost $600 million for the quarter as we've managed base CapEx and also increased operating cash flow. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for more details on our cash flow performance. The left part of this slide provides a multiyear trend for our operating and free cash flow. A few things that I'd like to point out. First, you can see that 2017 represented a record for both metrics. This result is a culmination of many efforts from our employees around the world. Second, free cash flow has steadily increased over the period as the organization managed capital spending in line with the underlying growth prospects. Finally, the quality of the business has also steadily increased as operating cash flow margins have improved from 19% to 27%. Said differently, in 2017, for every dollar of sales, we generated $0.27 of operating cash flow that we could either return to shareholders or invest for future growth. This is a very compelling story of both the resiliency of our business as well as the ability to leverage a recovery like we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The right part of this slide shows how we used the $3 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, resulting in a balance of growth investments, shareholder returns and debt reduction. We are currently pausing stock repurchases during the proposed merger, so I anticipate further declines in net debt leading up to close. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for tax and guidance update. In the fourth quarter, we booked a tax reform charge of $394 million or $1.36 of EPS. This charge is comprised of 3 pieces: a $467 million charge for the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; a $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriated foreign earnings; and a $333 million benefit associated with the revaluation of a deferred tax liability from 35% to 21%. There is no immediate cash impact from this charge, but cash will be impacted over several years as the liabilities are settled. This charge represents our best estimate of the current tax reform, but it is subject to change as new information becomes available. 
Looking forward, I anticipate the new tax reform will lower our current effective tax rate down to a range of 23% to 25%, depending upon how specific aspects of the reform are ultimately clarified by the U.S. Treasury Department. For purposes of guidance, we are assuming a tax rate near the middle of that range, which provides a quarterly benefit of approximately $0.05 when compared to our run rate. 
As far as guidance, the EPS estimate for the first quarter is in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, which includes the $0.05 for tax reform. First quarter is seasonally slower due to Lunar New Year and Carnival. Furthermore, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are undergoing a significant amount of turnarounds as several slated for 2017 were deferred into this quarter. Despite these known headwinds, we are expecting continued contribution from underlying price and volume, which will improve operating leverage. 
We did not provide a full year guidance range in light of the anticipated merger close date. As such, we do not expect Praxair will finish 2018 as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Our focus is to continue operating at a high-level performance while supporting the merger integration planning efforts for a successful start to Linde plc. We believe it is more appropriate to provide quarterly guidance for Praxair as the focus shifts to the new combined company in the second half of the year. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And again, I think we heard some, what I'll call good news that the past president's conviction was upheld a couple of days ago. So he won't be a factor in the elections, and he had a lot of popular support. But there's still going to be some volatility in the political climate. But to get back and answer your question, we've run as high as 22%, 23% in years past. So our objective begins to get it back to 20%."

And most of what's driving that number is China, just to be specific. So you've heard me talk about China in the past where we were really unhappy with the level of pricing, and there were several factors at play. There was excess supply in the merchant liquid market. You had captive steel companies and so forth putting by-product market on -- into the supply. So what has changed, there's really a couple of things. And one of which is if you look at the merchant liquid capacity utilization today, and that's usually a question I get somewhere along the line, I mean, we're in the 90s in terms of capacity utilization. And we're not alone in terms of the fact that given the growth, and there hasn't been the pace of merchant liquid capacity adds that we used to see in the past, that, that market has tightened up. But that's a good thing. And then the second thing, it was in my comments, was China is very serious about managing the environment. They realized they had overcapacity in many sectors, one of which was metals. Again, that's where we saw a lot of excess product come into the market. So as those Tier 2, Tier 3 metals customers are rationalized, then that product doesn't find its way into the market, which is a good thing. So those are some factors that are at play. And yes, I do expect this to continue."

And I'd give you an example of the formation that we would see lift in would be the San Juan Basin, for example, in New Mexico. So I would expect some improvement. Would we get all the way back to 4%? I'm not sure about that. It would certainly be a nice bonus for us going forward in terms of our earnings boost. You got to keep in mind, we sold a lot of nitrogen for oil pressurization, for maintenance to PEMEX, and they still have a lot of problems. And I said they bounced off of their bottom, but they're nowhere near their peak. And again, energy prices have moved up quite a bit. So they have issues managing the budget, but they also need to maintain the wells, and they're constantly trying to balance that. So yes, it would be nice to see. Will we get back to the 4% level?

And of course, with respect to the merger, I think that's a question that's better left for Linde to opine on. But if you look at what they've been talking about with respect to their engineering business, the fact that the backlog is strong, they've been adding projects to it, I think that speaks for itself.

And probably half of that does relate to some of the incentive impact. As I'd mentioned in the prepared remarks in '16, we really reduced that number down quite low given the weaker performance and that we did not reach a lot of our targets. So you're looking at kind of a couple percent, I think, natural growth, which is in line, I think, with inflation, in line with what you'd expect to merit impact.

When you look at on an average run rate, I'd expect the cash benefit to probably be somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million per year range. But you have to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously, that's based on our current interpretation of the tax reform. Obviously, it could be very subject to change as clarifications come out. But right now, I would estimate it in that range of $50 million to $60 million. Obviously, that is slightly less than the earnings, and that's due to the fact that with the upfront charge on the deemed repatriation, that won't be a factor in the ongoing earnings, but clearly, it'll be an effect on the cash. That all being said, for 2018, I don't expect any net impact because we are fully going to do some repatriation in this year. And withholding tax payments we will make on a cash basis, I anticipate to completely offset any of the benefit, primarily due to the rate differential in the U.S. So 2018, no net cash impact. Average annual run rate, probably $50 million to $60 million based on current interpretation. But as you probably know, on the deemed repatriation, that is a step-up formula for the cash. The first 5 years are at 8% of the obligation and then years 6, 7 and 8 step up to 15%, 20%, 25%. So after that 5-year run rate, the cash cost may go up a little higher and the benefit a little lower. But hopefully, that kind of gives you at least an understanding. And then as things change, if we need to update, we'll relook at that."

As I look at the chemicals number year-over-year, I think we had a little -- some project start-ups there as well that contributed somewhat to that number. But really, demand is quite strong in the U.S., as many of you on the call would know. Chemicals volumes will be driven by just the growth in the U.S. economy, industrial production, resi production. And of course, they're advantaged from a natural gas standpoint, looks like that will be a situation that will be sustained going forward. They'll have a natural gas feedstock advantage. And they're exporting now more than they used to. And that all drives demand for the chemicals in -- particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and volume for us."

Good morning, everyone. 2017 ended on a strong note, with growth across every major end market as the industrial economy steadily recovered. The discipline and focus of our entire employee base enabled us to capitalize on these trends while simultaneously making progress toward the merger with Linde. In fact, on Slide 4, you will find some specific examples of successful execution of our strategy. 
We presented this strategy approximately 3 years ago as commodity prices, emerging markets and industrial activity were collectively in decline. Our goal was to optimize the base business, capture quality growth opportunities and position the company for strong recovery when industrial markets improved. And I'm proud to say that the Praxair team has delivered. 
Over the last several years, we have taken actions to optimize the base business, which have culminated to record for both operating and free cash flow in 2017. Matt will discuss the numbers in more detail, but all of our employees contributed toward creating shareholder value and making our organization more efficient. 
While optimizing the base, we never took our eye off growing the business. In light of the market conditions of the last few years, we focused our efforts on those sectors that were less cyclical or had fundamental cost advantages where our customers were making capital investments. Our resilient market exposure has grown double digits from roughly 1/4 to 28% of the global portfolio. Furthermore, we have taken additional efforts to diversify and enhance the business portfolio through adding other nonindustrial projects to our backlog. These efforts are supported by recent announcements of contract wins for on-site customers, including nitrogen supply and process gases to Everdisplay's AMOLED manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In fact, as of now, electronic customers comprise roughly 10% of our project backlog versus just 2% last year. And that number will grow in light of new wins we expect in the coming months. 
In addition to portfolio management, we invested in strategic markets through acquisitions and joint ventures. Leveraging our extensive supply network and process gas expertise in the U.S. Gulf Coast enabled us to secure $1.1 billion worth of new projects, and we're not done yet. I fully expect more key wins in the coming quarters as we continue to see strong investments around the low-cost hydrocarbons. All of these efforts support future growth independent of the macroeconomic environment. 
But as macro conditions improve, we fully expect to leverage any cyclical recovery, as shown at the bottom of this page. And based on what we've seen over the last several months, I believe we are in the midst of an industrial recovery, especially in the U.S. and parts of Asia and Europe. We have positioned the business well to participate in this rebound while maintaining focused around our high-quality business. This is evidenced by recent growth trends from the business segments. 
But we also want to see margins expanding with this recovery. While sequentially, our margins have improved, we're lagging a bit from prior year. However, I fully expect margin expansion in 2018, which we are already experiencing in the first quarter. 
While executing the strategy, we also made significant progress toward the merger with Linde. I wasn't planning to cover what has already been completed, but suffice to say, it was a tremendous amount of work that our employees successfully managed while we continued to run the business at a high level. 
That being said, I would like to provide an update on key milestones, which you will find on Slide 5. The takeaway of this entire slide is that we're on track. Regulatory filings are being completed as expected, including the recently filed Form CO with the European Commission. In parallel, we're making good progress on the divestiture process. I expect bid packages to be distributed over the next few weeks, after which we will narrow the potential buyer pool. We will also take advantage of this time to accomplish as much integration planning work as we can to ensure a smooth transition post-close. 
So overall, we've made good progress. While we can't control the final outcome, we've had very constructive dialogues with the regulators, and milestones are being achieved according to the plan. I'm sure many of you will have questions about the merger, but realize there isn't much more I can say about the process or time line other than these points. 
Before I hand it over to Matt, I'd like to provide a brief update of business trends on Slide 6. North America at 52% of sales has seen growth across all end markets but, more specifically, strong recovery in the industrial sectors. In the last few months, U.S. industrial production growth for manufacturing has exceeded 2%, and key subsectors of metal fabrication and machinery have grown mid-single digits. This has led to robust growth in our on-site customers for metals, downstream energy and chemicals as well as manufacturing for our packaged gas business. 
Same-store sales. Hardgoods grew in the high teens and gas in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We also saw a substantial amount of capital equipment sales in the U.S., which may bode well for future industrial and infrastructure activity. Additionally, the chemicals market is growing double digits, while our metals customers continue to perform well as reductions in global steel capacity and improved trade balances have supported domestic production. Our confidence remains high in adding new projects to the backlog from the U.S. Gulf Coast as we are finalizing contract negotiations on a few large projects. 
Energy markets are also growing double digit in North America but mostly driven by downstream refining. Our customers ran quite hard in the fourth quarter as they rebounded quickly from the hurricanes, but we anticipate a significant turnaround season in this first quarter as several customer outages were deferred in 2017. 
While oil pricing has rebounded, there hasn't been a meaningful uptick in our upstream business. Mexico has bounced off the low rates, and we are seeing slow improvement in the U.S., but most customers are still operating in the lowest-cost regions using slickwater techniques that don't require very much nitrogen. If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gases, but we aren't -- but we just aren't seeing much of that yet. 
South America at 13% of our sales has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved, with low to mid-single-digit IP growth over the last few months. Most end markets have been flat to up, although manufacturing and metals have grown more than other sectors, which may signal some thawing of industrial investments. I wish I could say that I am bullish for recovery, but the uncertainty around the political situation in Brazil will likely result in a continued hold on investments. So at this point, I'm not expecting much from Brazil for the first half of 2018. On the bright side, Argentina continues to be a good growth story, and the commodity rebound should help countries like Chile and Peru, but time will tell on the pace of the Brazilian recovery. 
Similar to the other regions, Europe has grown in all end markets but most in the industrial areas of metals and manufacturing. Germany, Italy and Spain have all contributed nicely to the growth in segment sales and profits. However, the Nordics and Russia are still lagging on performance just given their local economies. But overall, Europe continues to be a positive story. 
Asia at 16% of sales has been our strongest growth story for the year, both organically and for new on-site contracts for the project backlog. Double-digit volume growth in chemicals, electronics, manufacturing and metals have contributed to the results. As the Chinese economy rationalizes excess production capacity in key markets like steel, we have benefited from a combination of being partnered with the right on-site customers and improved supply-demand balance in the merchant liquid market. Pricing has improved several quarters in a row as pent-up inflation is working through the supply chain. In China and more specifically Korea, we continue to see significant on-site opportunities around electronics, primarily high-purity nitrogen but also other processed gases used in fabs. 
In 2017, we announced 3 new projects serving the electronics industry, and there are more to come. In fact, we were recently awarded a very large project, which I expect will be announced shortly. The opportunity set for new projects in Asia, especially electronics, has been quite strong, but we continue to maintain our discipline to only partner with the right customers in terms that fit our risk-reward criteria. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk through the numbers."
318049,548933491,1374190,"Praxair, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2018",2018-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance. And you can see that volume is the largest contributor, with 7% and 1% growth from last year and third quarter, respectively. When comparing to prior year, every major end market expanded, led by electronics, chemicals and energy. 
From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the greatest growth from a combination of recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, about 2/3 came from organic volume, with the rest supported by project start-ups. The 1% sequential growth was also supported by U.S. and Asia as the U.S. Gulf Coast recovered from the third quarter hurricanes, and we saw general improvement in manufacturing activity in both regions. 
South America was seasonally weak as expected due to the holidays and summer break. End market trends were also consistent with expectations. As the energy market rebounded from the U.S. Gulf Coast, it was partially offset by seasonally weaker beverage sales in the northern hemisphere. 
The price/mix improvement of 1% was achieved from focused pricing actions, partially offset by some unfavorable mix impacts in specific regions, especially in South America and Europe. Asian merchant liquid had the strongest performance of the segments, while pricing action in North America were partially offset by the effect of higher capital equipment sales in our packaged gas business. 
Currency translation is favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean won. 
Operating profit of $653 million is $54 million or 9% better than last year and $11 million or 2% better than the third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter in a row where we have expanded operating margins. However, it is lower by 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. About 20 basis points relates to the impact of higher cost pass-through, so the underlying margin decline from Q4 2016 is about 40 basis points. 
There are 3 main drivers negatively affecting this. First is the unfavorable mix issues we discussed, including capital equipment sales and overall South America. Second relates to restructuring charges embedded in the results, which you can see in the other income trends. And third relates to the fact that fourth quarter of 2016 had a lower run-rate SG&A as we had to reverse some of the incentive compensation accruals last year due to weaker results. But that is 1-quarter comparison in time, and several of these items will not repeat. As Steve mentioned, we are quite confident that we will be expanding margins in 2018, including the first quarter. More importantly, our operating cash flow margins have increased for 3 straight years to a record 27% in 2017, which I'll speak to on the next slide. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve with strong capital management and cash generation. Return on capital has steadily risen each quarter, reaching 12.5% by year-end. I expect that number to continue to improve throughout 2018. Our available operating cash flow, which represents operating cash flow minus non-backlog or what we call base CapEx, has grown to almost $600 million for the quarter as we've managed base CapEx and also increased operating cash flow. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for more details on our cash flow performance. The left part of this slide provides a multiyear trend for our operating and free cash flow. A few things that I'd like to point out. First, you can see that 2017 represented a record for both metrics. This result is a culmination of many efforts from our employees around the world. Second, free cash flow has steadily increased over the period as the organization managed capital spending in line with the underlying growth prospects. Finally, the quality of the business has also steadily increased as operating cash flow margins have improved from 19% to 27%. Said differently, in 2017, for every dollar of sales, we generated $0.27 of operating cash flow that we could either return to shareholders or invest for future growth. This is a very compelling story of both the resiliency of our business as well as the ability to leverage a recovery like we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The right part of this slide shows how we used the $3 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, resulting in a balance of growth investments, shareholder returns and debt reduction. We are currently pausing stock repurchases during the proposed merger, so I anticipate further declines in net debt leading up to close. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for tax and guidance update. In the fourth quarter, we booked a tax reform charge of $394 million or $1.36 of EPS. This charge is comprised of 3 pieces: a $467 million charge for the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; a $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriated foreign earnings; and a $333 million benefit associated with the revaluation of a deferred tax liability from 35% to 21%. There is no immediate cash impact from this charge, but cash will be impacted over several years as the liabilities are settled. This charge represents our best estimate of the current tax reform, but it is subject to change as new information becomes available. 
Looking forward, I anticipate the new tax reform will lower our current effective tax rate down to a range of 23% to 25%, depending upon how specific aspects of the reform are ultimately clarified by the U.S. Treasury Department. For purposes of guidance, we are assuming a tax rate near the middle of that range, which provides a quarterly benefit of approximately $0.05 when compared to our run rate. 
As far as guidance, the EPS estimate for the first quarter is in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, which includes the $0.05 for tax reform. First quarter is seasonally slower due to Lunar New Year and Carnival. Furthermore, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are undergoing a significant amount of turnarounds as several slated for 2017 were deferred into this quarter. Despite these known headwinds, we are expecting continued contribution from underlying price and volume, which will improve operating leverage. 
We did not provide a full year guidance range in light of the anticipated merger close date. As such, we do not expect Praxair will finish 2018 as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Our focus is to continue operating at a high-level performance while supporting the merger integration planning efforts for a successful start to Linde plc. We believe it is more appropriate to provide quarterly guidance for Praxair as the focus shifts to the new combined company in the second half of the year. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And most of what's driving that number is China, just to be specific. So you've heard me talk about China in the past where we were really unhappy with the level of pricing, and there were several factors at play. There was excess supply in the merchant liquid market. You had captive steel companies and so forth putting by-product market on -- into the supply. So what has changed, there's really a couple of things. And one of which is if you look at the merchant liquid capacity utilization today, and that's usually a question I get somewhere along the line, I mean, we're in the 90s in terms of capacity utilization. And we're not alone in terms of the fact that given the growth, and there hasn't been the pace of merchant liquid capacity adds that we used to see in the past, that, that market has tightened up. But that's a good thing. And then the second thing, it was in my comments, was China is very serious about managing the environment. They realized they had overcapacity in many sectors, one of which was metals. Again, that's where we saw a lot of excess product come into the market. So as those Tier 2, Tier 3 metals customers are rationalized, then that product doesn't find its way into the market, which is a good thing. So those are some factors that are at play. And yes, I do expect this to continue."

And I'd give you an example of the formation that we would see lift in would be the San Juan Basin, for example, in New Mexico. So I would expect some improvement. Would we get all the way back to 4%? I'm not sure about that. It would certainly be a nice bonus for us going forward in terms of our earnings boost. You got to keep in mind, we sold a lot of nitrogen for oil pressurization, for maintenance to PEMEX, and they still have a lot of problems. And I said they bounced off of their bottom, but they're nowhere near their peak. And again, energy prices have moved up quite a bit. So they have issues managing the budget, but they also need to maintain the wells, and they're constantly trying to balance that. So yes, it would be nice to see. Will we get back to the 4% level?

And of course, with respect to the merger, I think that's a question that's better left for Linde to opine on.

So they're making massive investments. We've always been very well positioned with Samsung. We have a great relationship, long track record of reliability in meeting their needs. And that's why we're so confident in the electronics picture going forward. There were other projects obviously that we won in China. There was 1 or 2 in the U.S. as well. But again, Samsung's the 800-pound gorilla in the electronics space."

And so that situation really hasn't corrected itself yet. I would say, generally speaking, though -- we talk about Brazil going the other direction where they historically have been high inflation, now they're low inflation, sub-3%. Most parts of the world are seeing some inflation. I can look at Mexico, I can see some inflation. I can look at other parts where inflation is starting to become more of a factor. And so for us coming into the year, this is something we talk about at our leadership conference that we want to make sure we get out ahead of that inflation curve, we want to make sure that given we're seeing some good volume growth in certain regions, that we also make sure that we're taking advantage of the pricing opportunities that exist there.

And probably half of that does relate to some of the incentive impact. As I'd mentioned in the prepared remarks in '16, we really reduced that number down quite low given the weaker performance and that we did not reach a lot of our targets. So you're looking at kind of a couple percent, I think, natural growth, which is in line, I think, with inflation, in line with what you'd expect to merit impact. And I see no reason why -- looking into '18, why that would be any different. So when I remove that variable component, which can go up and down, I think just kind of a low single-digit inflation-like number is what we tend to see in normal years."

When you look at on an average run rate, I'd expect the cash benefit to probably be somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million per year range. But you have to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously, that's based on our current interpretation of the tax reform. Obviously, it could be very subject to change as clarifications come out. But right now, I would estimate it in that range of $50 million to $60 million. Obviously, that is slightly less than the earnings, and that's due to the fact that with the upfront charge on the deemed repatriation, that won't be a factor in the ongoing earnings, but clearly, it'll be an effect on the cash. That all being said, for 2018, I don't expect any net impact because we are fully going to do some repatriation in this year. And withholding tax payments we will make on a cash basis, I anticipate to completely offset any of the benefit, primarily due to the rate differential in the U.S. So 2018, no net cash impact. Average annual run rate, probably $50 million to $60 million based on current interpretation. But as you probably know, on the deemed repatriation, that is a step-up formula for the cash. The first 5 years are at 8% of the obligation and then years 6, 7 and 8 step up to 15%, 20%, 25%. So after that 5-year run rate, the cash cost may go up a little higher and the benefit a little lower. But hopefully, that kind of gives you at least an understanding.

As I look at the chemicals number year-over-year, I think we had a little -- some project start-ups there as well that contributed somewhat to that number. But really, demand is quite strong in the U.S., as many of you on the call would know. Chemicals volumes will be driven by just the growth in the U.S. economy, industrial production, resi production. And of course, they're advantaged from a natural gas standpoint, looks like that will be a situation that will be sustained going forward. They'll have a natural gas feedstock advantage. And they're exporting now more than they used to. And that all drives demand for the chemicals in -- particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and volume for us."

Good morning, everyone. 2017 ended on a strong note, with growth across every major end market as the industrial economy steadily recovered. The discipline and focus of our entire employee base enabled us to capitalize on these trends while simultaneously making progress toward the merger with Linde. In fact, on Slide 4, you will find some specific examples of successful execution of our strategy. 
We presented this strategy approximately 3 years ago as commodity prices, emerging markets and industrial activity were collectively in decline. Our goal was to optimize the base business, capture quality growth opportunities and position the company for strong recovery when industrial markets improved. And I'm proud to say that the Praxair team has delivered. 
Over the last several years, we have taken actions to optimize the base business, which have culminated to record for both operating and free cash flow in 2017. Matt will discuss the numbers in more detail, but all of our employees contributed toward creating shareholder value and making our organization more efficient. 
While optimizing the base, we never took our eye off growing the business. In light of the market conditions of the last few years, we focused our efforts on those sectors that were less cyclical or had fundamental cost advantages where our customers were making capital investments. Our resilient market exposure has grown double digits from roughly 1/4 to 28% of the global portfolio. Furthermore, we have taken additional efforts to diversify and enhance the business portfolio through adding other nonindustrial projects to our backlog. These efforts are supported by recent announcements of contract wins for on-site customers, including nitrogen supply and process gases to Everdisplay's AMOLED manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In fact, as of now, electronic customers comprise roughly 10% of our project backlog versus just 2% last year. And that number will grow in light of new wins we expect in the coming months. 
In addition to portfolio management, we invested in strategic markets through acquisitions and joint ventures. Leveraging our extensive supply network and process gas expertise in the U.S. Gulf Coast enabled us to secure $1.1 billion worth of new projects, and we're not done yet. I fully expect more key wins in the coming quarters as we continue to see strong investments around the low-cost hydrocarbons. All of these efforts support future growth independent of the macroeconomic environment. 
But as macro conditions improve, we fully expect to leverage any cyclical recovery, as shown at the bottom of this page. And based on what we've seen over the last several months, I believe we are in the midst of an industrial recovery, especially in the U.S. and parts of Asia and Europe. We have positioned the business well to participate in this rebound while maintaining focused around our high-quality business. This is evidenced by recent growth trends from the business segments. 
But we also want to see margins expanding with this recovery. While sequentially, our margins have improved, we're lagging a bit from prior year. However, I fully expect margin expansion in 2018, which we are already experiencing in the first quarter. 
While executing the strategy, we also made significant progress toward the merger with Linde. I wasn't planning to cover what has already been completed, but suffice to say, it was a tremendous amount of work that our employees successfully managed while we continued to run the business at a high level. 
That being said, I would like to provide an update on key milestones, which you will find on Slide 5. The takeaway of this entire slide is that we're on track. Regulatory filings are being completed as expected, including the recently filed Form CO with the European Commission. In parallel, we're making good progress on the divestiture process. I expect bid packages to be distributed over the next few weeks, after which we will narrow the potential buyer pool. We will also take advantage of this time to accomplish as much integration planning work as we can to ensure a smooth transition post-close. 
So overall, we've made good progress. While we can't control the final outcome, we've had very constructive dialogues with the regulators, and milestones are being achieved according to the plan. I'm sure many of you will have questions about the merger, but realize there isn't much more I can say about the process or time line other than these points. 
Before I hand it over to Matt, I'd like to provide a brief update of business trends on Slide 6. North America at 52% of sales has seen growth across all end markets but, more specifically, strong recovery in the industrial sectors. In the last few months, U.S. industrial production growth for manufacturing has exceeded 2%, and key subsectors of metal fabrication and machinery have grown mid-single digits. This has led to robust growth in our on-site customers for metals, downstream energy and chemicals as well as manufacturing for our packaged gas business. 
Same-store sales. Hardgoods grew in the high teens and gas in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We also saw a substantial amount of capital equipment sales in the U.S., which may bode well for future industrial and infrastructure activity. Additionally, the chemicals market is growing double digits, while our metals customers continue to perform well as reductions in global steel capacity and improved trade balances have supported domestic production. Our confidence remains high in adding new projects to the backlog from the U.S. Gulf Coast as we are finalizing contract negotiations on a few large projects. 
Energy markets are also growing double digit in North America but mostly driven by downstream refining. Our customers ran quite hard in the fourth quarter as they rebounded quickly from the hurricanes, but we anticipate a significant turnaround season in this first quarter as several customer outages were deferred in 2017. 
While oil pricing has rebounded, there hasn't been a meaningful uptick in our upstream business. Mexico has bounced off the low rates, and we are seeing slow improvement in the U.S., but most customers are still operating in the lowest-cost regions using slickwater techniques that don't require very much nitrogen. If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gases, but we aren't -- but we just aren't seeing much of that yet. 
South America at 13% of our sales has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved, with low to mid-single-digit IP growth over the last few months. Most end markets have been flat to up, although manufacturing and metals have grown more than other sectors, which may signal some thawing of industrial investments. I wish I could say that I am bullish for recovery, but the uncertainty around the political situation in Brazil will likely result in a continued hold on investments. So at this point, I'm not expecting much from Brazil for the first half of 2018. On the bright side, Argentina continues to be a good growth story, and the commodity rebound should help countries like Chile and Peru, but time will tell on the pace of the Brazilian recovery. 
Similar to the other regions, Europe has grown in all end markets but most in the industrial areas of metals and manufacturing. Germany, Italy and Spain have all contributed nicely to the growth in segment sales and profits. However, the Nordics and Russia are still lagging on performance just given their local economies. But overall, Europe continues to be a positive story. 
Asia at 16% of sales has been our strongest growth story for the year, both organically and for new on-site contracts for the project backlog. Double-digit volume growth in chemicals, electronics, manufacturing and metals have contributed to the results. As the Chinese economy rationalizes excess production capacity in key markets like steel, we have benefited from a combination of being partnered with the right on-site customers and improved supply-demand balance in the merchant liquid market. Pricing has improved several quarters in a row as pent-up inflation is working through the supply chain. In China and more specifically Korea, we continue to see significant on-site opportunities around electronics, primarily high-purity nitrogen but also other processed gases used in fabs. 
In 2017, we announced 3 new projects serving the electronics industry, and there are more to come. In fact, we were recently awarded a very large project, which I expect will be announced shortly. The opportunity set for new projects in Asia, especially electronics, has been quite strong, but we continue to maintain our discipline to only partner with the right customers in terms that fit our risk-reward criteria. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk through the numbers."

Please turn to Slide 8 for our fourth quarter results. Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year.

Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance. And you can see that volume is the largest contributor, with 7% and 1% growth from last year and third quarter, respectively. When comparing to prior year, every major end market expanded, led by electronics, chemicals and energy. 
From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the greatest growth from a combination of recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, about 2/3 came from organic volume, with the rest supported by project start-ups. The 1% sequential growth was also supported by U.S. and Asia as the U.S. Gulf Coast recovered from the third quarter hurricanes, and we saw general improvement in manufacturing activity in both regions. 
South America was seasonally weak as expected due to the holidays and summer break. End market trends were also consistent with expectations. As the energy market rebounded from the U.S. Gulf Coast, it was partially offset by seasonally weaker beverage sales in the northern hemisphere. 
The price/mix improvement of 1% was achieved from focused pricing actions, partially offset by some unfavorable mix impacts in specific regions, especially in South America and Europe. Asian merchant liquid had the strongest performance of the segments, while pricing action in North America were partially offset by the effect of higher capital equipment sales in our packaged gas business. 
Currency translation is favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean won. 
Operating profit of $653 million is $54 million or 9% better than last year and $11 million or 2% better than the third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter in a row where we have expanded operating margins. However, it is lower by 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. About 20 basis points relates to the impact of higher cost pass-through, so the underlying margin decline from Q4 2016 is about 40 basis points. 
There are 3 main drivers negatively affecting this. First is the unfavorable mix issues we discussed, including capital equipment sales and overall South America. Second relates to restructuring charges embedded in the results, which you can see in the other income trends. And third relates to the fact that fourth quarter of 2016 had a lower run-rate SG&A as we had to reverse some of the incentive compensation accruals last year due to weaker results. But that is 1-quarter comparison in time, and several of these items will not repeat. As Steve mentioned, we are quite confident that we will be expanding margins in 2018, including the first quarter. More importantly, our operating cash flow margins have increased for 3 straight years to a record 27% in 2017, which I'll speak to on the next slide. 
Our balance sheet continues to improve with strong capital management and cash generation. Return on capital has steadily risen each quarter, reaching 12.5% by year-end. I expect that number to continue to improve throughout 2018. Our available operating cash flow, which represents operating cash flow minus non-backlog or what we call base CapEx, has grown to almost $600 million for the quarter as we've managed base CapEx and also increased operating cash flow. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for more details on our cash flow performance. The left part of this slide provides a multiyear trend for our operating and free cash flow. A few things that I'd like to point out. First, you can see that 2017 represented a record for both metrics. This result is a culmination of many efforts from our employees around the world. Second, free cash flow has steadily increased over the period as the organization managed capital spending in line with the underlying growth prospects. Finally, the quality of the business has also steadily increased as operating cash flow margins have improved from 19% to 27%. Said differently, in 2017, for every dollar of sales, we generated $0.27 of operating cash flow that we could either return to shareholders or invest for future growth. This is a very compelling story of both the resiliency of our business as well as the ability to leverage a recovery like we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The right part of this slide shows how we used the $3 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, resulting in a balance of growth investments, shareholder returns and debt reduction. We are currently pausing stock repurchases during the proposed merger, so I anticipate further declines in net debt leading up to close. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for tax and guidance update. In the fourth quarter, we booked a tax reform charge of $394 million or $1.36 of EPS. This charge is comprised of 3 pieces: a $467 million charge for the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; a $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriated foreign earnings; and a $333 million benefit associated with the revaluation of a deferred tax liability from 35% to 21%. There is no immediate cash impact from this charge, but cash will be impacted over several years as the liabilities are settled. This charge represents our best estimate of the current tax reform, but it is subject to change as new information becomes available. 
Looking forward, I anticipate the new tax reform will lower our current effective tax rate down to a range of 23% to 25%, depending upon how specific aspects of the reform are ultimately clarified by the U.S. Treasury Department. For purposes of guidance, we are assuming a tax rate near the middle of that range, which provides a quarterly benefit of approximately $0.05 when compared to our run rate. 
As far as guidance, the EPS estimate for the first quarter is in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, which includes the $0.05 for tax reform. First quarter is seasonally slower due to Lunar New Year and Carnival. Furthermore, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are undergoing a significant amount of turnarounds as several slated for 2017 were deferred into this quarter. Despite these known headwinds, we are expecting continued contribution from underlying price and volume, which will improve operating leverage. 
We did not provide a full year guidance range in light of the anticipated merger close date. As such, we do not expect Praxair will finish 2018 as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Our focus is to continue operating at a high-level performance while supporting the merger integration planning efforts for a successful start to Linde plc. We believe it is more appropriate to provide quarterly guidance for Praxair as the focus shifts to the new combined company in the second half of the year. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And most of what's driving that number is China, just to be specific. So you've heard me talk about China in the past where we were really unhappy with the level of pricing, and there were several factors at play. There was excess supply in the merchant liquid market. You had captive steel companies and so forth putting by-product market on -- into the supply. So what has changed, there's really a couple of things. And one of which is if you look at the merchant liquid capacity utilization today, and that's usually a question I get somewhere along the line, I mean, we're in the 90s in terms of capacity utilization. And we're not alone in terms of the fact that given the growth, and there hasn't been the pace of merchant liquid capacity adds that we used to see in the past, that, that market has tightened up. But that's a good thing. And then the second thing, it was in my comments, was China is very serious about managing the environment. They realized they had overcapacity in many sectors, one of which was metals. Again, that's where we saw a lot of excess product come into the market.

And I'd give you an example of the formation that we would see lift in would be the San Juan Basin, for example, in New Mexico. So I would expect some improvement. Would we get all the way back to 4%? I'm not sure about that. It would certainly be a nice bonus for us going forward in terms of our earnings boost. You got to keep in mind, we sold a lot of nitrogen for oil pressurization, for maintenance to PEMEX, and they still have a lot of problems. And I said they bounced off of their bottom, but they're nowhere near their peak. And again, energy prices have moved up quite a bit. So they have issues managing the budget, but they also need to maintain the wells, and they're constantly trying to balance that. So yes, it would be nice to see. Will we get back to the 4% level?

And of course, with respect to the merger, I think that's a question that's better left for Linde to opine on. But if you look at what they've been talking about with respect to their engineering business, the fact that the backlog is strong, they've been adding projects to it, I think that speaks for itself.

And probably half of that does relate to some of the incentive impact. As I'd mentioned in the prepared remarks in '16, we really reduced that number down quite low given the weaker performance and that we did not reach a lot of our targets. So you're looking at kind of a couple percent, I think, natural growth, which is in line, I think, with inflation, in line with what you'd expect to merit impact.

And as we look at some of the projects that we're talking about, our view of risk and return is it's not that attractive to us and especially given the other opportunities that we have, which, in our view, offer a better risk-return situation."

When you look at on an average run rate, I'd expect the cash benefit to probably be somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million per year range. But you have to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously, that's based on our current interpretation of the tax reform. Obviously, it could be very subject to change as clarifications come out. But right now, I would estimate it in that range of $50 million to $60 million. Obviously, that is slightly less than the earnings, and that's due to the fact that with the upfront charge on the deemed repatriation, that won't be a factor in the ongoing earnings, but clearly, it'll be an effect on the cash. That all being said, for 2018, I don't expect any net impact because we are fully going to do some repatriation in this year. And withholding tax payments we will make on a cash basis, I anticipate to completely offset any of the benefit, primarily due to the rate differential in the U.S. So 2018, no net cash impact. Average annual run rate, probably $50 million to $60 million based on current interpretation. But as you probably know, on the deemed repatriation, that is a step-up formula for the cash. The first 5 years are at 8% of the obligation and then years 6, 7 and 8 step up to 15%, 20%, 25%. So after that 5-year run rate, the cash cost may go up a little higher and the benefit a little lower. But hopefully, that kind of gives you at least an understanding. And then as things change, if we need to update, we'll relook at that."

But really, demand is quite strong in the U.S., as many of you on the call would know. Chemicals volumes will be driven by just the growth in the U.S. economy, industrial production, resi production. And of course, they're advantaged from a natural gas standpoint, looks like that will be a situation that will be sustained going forward. They'll have a natural gas feedstock advantage. And they're exporting now more than they used to. And that all drives demand for the chemicals in -- particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and volume for us."

318049,557892341,1438186,"Praxair, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. .First quarter results were quite strong, with 10% sales and 20% EPS growth compared to prior year.

First quarter results were quite strong, with 10% sales and 20% EPS growth compared to prior year. Volume and price improvements were retained across every segment and end market, which supported an operating margin expansion of 140 basis points.
A little under half of the volume growth came from the startup of backlog projects in North America and Asia. In fact, 1/3 or $500 million started up in the first quarter this year. Yet, we held the backlog constant at $1.5 billion with new customer contract wins. 
So while the backlog may be steady, it is from continual turnover of new project wins replacing those that are removed due to starting up, which clearly helps grow our earnings and returns. 
And while the global team focused on delivering these results, we continued to make good progress on the merger with Linde. I'll speak that more on an upcoming slide, but first, I'd like to provide a brief update of global business trends, which you can find on Slide 4.
North America is our second fastest-growing region supported by the industrial recovery in the U.S. Over half of the 4% volume growth was driven by improvements in chemicals from new investments starting up in the U.S. Gulf Coast and manufacturing as the U.S. package business continues to grow high-single digits. And higher volumes in the metals, electronics and resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care more than offset a 1% decline related to customer turnarounds in the Gulf Coast.
There was modest recovery in the upstream energy business, especially in U.S. and Mexico, from increased well completion activity. However, this growth was from a very low base as volumes are still significantly below peak levels. 
Overall pricing in the region has been improving along with inflation, enabling margin expansion over both prior year and the fourth quarter. 
Project bidding opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains healthy. Despite the recent large startups, the current backlog has over $750 million of the U.S. projects under construction, and we're still confident in winning new projects over the next several quarters. 
South America continues to lag all of the regions and now comprises only 12% of global sales and 8% of global operating profit. Volume growth was slightly better than prior year but 3% lower than the fourth quarter due to the seasonal effects of Carnival and Easter holiday. The primary driver of growth relates to on-site metals customers as their volumes ramped up to meet slightly higher demand. However, several of those customers are still below take-or-pay levels. 
A combination of pricing and cost actions have enabled some margin expansion from prior year, but frankly, South America will remain a challenging place until there is more clarity around the direction of Brazilian politics. 
Europe continues to be a steady, stable grower, with underlying growth rates improving 3%. Volume growth occurred across every major end market, although metals and manufacturing comprised half of the improvement with a pickup in industrial activity. Resilient markets also remain strong as we continue to identify new growth opportunities with the acquired CO2 business. 
There are a few signs of inflation returning to the economy, primarily in the form of higher power costs, which are driving pass-through up 2% versus prior year. These trends are enabling some pricing opportunities up 1%, but more efforts are underway to recover the cost inflation. 
Asia is our fastest-growing region, with sales up 21% and operating profit up 39% from 2017 first quarter. While foreign currency appreciation is driving about 7% of the growth, underlying conditions remain quite robust across China, India and Korea. The 11% higher volumes are roughly split between project startups and organic growth, with project startups supporting energy and electronics end markets and the industrial recovery supporting increases in chemicals, manufacturing and metals. 
The pricing improvement of 3% primarily relates to merchant gases in China as structural supply challenges have eased with the closing of several liquifiers attached to Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills. 
And earlier this week, we announced Praxair's single largest project win, where we will build, own and operate high-purity nitrogen plans for Samsung's newly constructed fab in [indiscernible], South Korea. In addition to this win, there are several other opportunities to support the growing demand for electronic devices.
And finally, in our PST business, aerospace continues to grow high-single to low double digits, while oil and gas is making a modest recovery. Our aviation business has been making significant investments towards capacity expansion to serve the growing demand for aircraft engine coatings, and we anticipate continued ramping of revenues for the next several quarters.
So in summary, the synchronized industrial recovery, coupled with timely startups of the project backlog, have led to 5% volume growth spread across every end market and segment. Furthermore, pockets of growing inflation have enabled higher pricing attainment in certain regions. The combination of the volume and price contribution have expanded overall operating margins for the fourth consecutive quarter. This backdrop, coupled with U.S. tax reform, appears to be supporting more customer capital investments and, thus, opportunity to increase our project backlog above the current $1.5 billion level. 
Before Juan provides more details on the financial results, I'd like to offer a brief update on the merger with Linde, which you will find on Slide 5. 
You may recall the start of this process, we defined 3 key phases required to complete the merger. The first 2 phases, defining the structure and value creation with the execution of the BCA and obtaining all necessary shareholder approvals through the Praxair vote and Linde tender, have both been achieved. As planned, we are now deep into the third phase, which includes obtaining appropriate regulatory approval and finalizing any relevant remedies associated with those approvals. 
The slide shows a high-level time line of actions underway and milestones required to close the merger by the BaFin mandated long stop date in October of this year. The joint team continues to have constructive dialogue with all regulators and is actively engaged with potential buyers of asset divestitures. 
Overall, we feel quite good about our progress and ability to complete remaining milestones within the required time line. However, as you can imagine, this is a particularly important phase involving many outside parties, so I appreciate your understanding that we simply are not in a position at this time to answer any questions on merger progress or details of ongoing discussions with regulators or potential asset buyers.

Please turn to Slide 6 in our presentation for our consolidated results. 
Sales of just under $3 billion were 10% higher than last year and up 2% sequentially. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance, and you can see the volume is the largest contributor with 5% growth versus last year. 
When comparing to prior year, every major end market grew led by chemicals, electronics and metals. From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the largest organic growth from a combination of continued recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. 
Globally, of our total volume, more than half came from the base business, and the rest was driven by project startups. Sequentially, volumes are flat as first quarter is seasonally slower, primarily due to Lunar New Year and the timing of Easter. 
Furthermore, U.S. Gulf Coast customers underwent significant turnarounds, which offset the volume growth in the rest of our North American business. 
In Europe, volumes grew sequentially 1% led by the manufacturing end market, more specifically, in Spain and Germany. South America and Asia were seasonally weaker due to the holidays in the first quarter.
Sequentially, end market trends were also consistent with expectations as the industrial growth seen globally was offset by the energy drop in the turnarounds. The price/mix improvement of 2% was achieved from focused price actions across all our segments, primarily led by Asia and North America. 
As mentioned earlier, Asian merchant had the strongest price attainment, led by China, where structural challenges have eased a couple of the growing economy. 
Currency translation was favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese R&D and the Mexican peso. 
Operating profit of $672 million was $99 million or 17% better than last year and $16 million or 2% better than the fourth quarter. Operating margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially, led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business, positive pricing, good volume growth and tightly manage costs.
Operating cash flow was $688 million, $22 million below prior year quarter, mainly driven by foreign withholding tax payments of $65 million in the first quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $325 million, and as a result, our free cash flow was [ $363 ] million, which were used primarily to pay dividends and reduce net debt by $86 million. 
We fully expect an improvement in next quarter's cash flow, in line with prior trends. 
Project backlog closed the quarter at $1.5 billion after starting up 3 new projects in the U.S., one of them being Yara Freeport. We also announced 2 new on-site project wins in South Korea for the electronics end market, which add up a half a billion dollars. As we continue this backlog again cadence of wins and startups, our incremental 3% EPS growth from project contribution will extend additional years. 
Return on capital has steadily been rising for the past 4 quarters, now reaching 13%. As we continue to grow earnings, execute our backlog and manage cash generation, we expect our return on capital improving throughout 2018.
With that, now I'll turn the call back to Matt."

For the second quarter, EPS guidance range is $1.67 to $1.72, which represents 14% to 18% growth from last year. Year-over-year currency tailwind is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter as we begin to lap easier prior year comps, especially in the euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. 
The tax rate is still expected in the range of 23% to 25% and likely closer to the middle of that range consistent with the first quarter. 
Excluding tax and currency, this guidance represents a double-digit growth rate driven by an assumption of similar levels of demand continuing through June. 
To sum things up, we had a very good start to the year and are anticipating a continuation into the second quarter. The Praxair team has been able to capitalize on an industrial recovery through higher organic volume growth and securing new on-site contracts. 
In addition, the recent reflation effect in certain economies has presented pricing opportunities that have not been present for several years. A combination of these factors should enable continued growth with positive operating margin expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

Obviously, sequential will be affected by the normal seasonal declines. So when you look year-over-year, a little bit of improvement. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen steel volumes tick up, not a lot of benefit to us given most of those were under take-or-pay. Usually, in my experience, when you see the infrastructure like metals and things start to ramp up, that tends to be a good sign of some form of an industrial recovery. But that all being said, the uncertainty around the elections, and it's not just obviously Brazil, you have a similar situation in Colombia. You've got some situations going on politically in Peru. But I think when you added altogether, Brazil has the biggest one. We just don't have a lot of good idea in terms of how the politics will be run, how businesses will be viewed until the election in October. And right now, frankly, we're not even sure of the candidates. So when clarity comes around that, I think it could hopefully -- it'll have an effect on confidence one way or the other. But it gives some confidence that there'll be more, I'll say, business-friendly approach. I think you will start to see some investments. But I think most people are waiting, and it's probably prudent, and we'll just see. And so from that perspective, small improvements here and there. The resilient market still continue to do well, and that was an area we had a lot of focus. But until then, we've been managing costs pretty tightly. We are getting some price, and we just got to work through these next quarters until there's more clarity."

Manufacturing, it's not quite double digits, which is clearly a large just, but we're seeing improvements in our cylinder gases, dry ice. We're seeing a lot of improvements in Tier 2 auto. Aerospace continues to be quite strong. So I would say, it's across the board.

When you get our [ Qs ] by the segment analysis, you'll be able to see the OP effect within each segment on FX. But for the most part, it follows the top line. Q2, and when we look at the FX, we lock in the forward rates at the beginning of the month. Clearly, rates have moved here over the last couple of weeks, so it's pretty volatile. But I would say, we expect definitely something less than 3% for Q2, partly because Q2 of last year, the rates were stronger. The foreign rates vis-à-vis the dollar when they were in Q1, so the comps get tougher. But also, I'd say rates at least on a couple week basis here have gotten a little weaker on the foreign. So the combination of that 2 will put at something below 3%, could be 2%, could be 1% based on where we're at now, it remains to be seen."

So I'll try to take them in order here. The first question on the backlog. The challenge, I think, of trying to project the split between call it U.S. chemicals and refining North America versus Asian electronics is the project sizes are so lumpy, right? So the timing of when the projects come in could skew that. We still see a lot of quite large projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast as new opportunities, and they're both refining and petchem opportunities. With Asia, clearly to your point, we've added some large electronics. There are others out there as well, so it depends on timing. I think we'll probably see a little more move back to U.S. and refining and energy in the coming quarters just based on where things are, but it just remains to be seen on the timing and when things are ultimately signed. But we feel pretty good about the trend on both. And frankly, I'm indifferent, which when we get as long as these projects meet our criteria, which they do. So on Freeport, yes, we clearly feel good about having those assets there. Any time you have an opportunity to extend your network into a region and bring both atmospheric and process gases, we see as a very good thing. And so we continue to find some incremental opportunities off that, which we're pursuing. And we just continue to look for ways to extend the network. So I think it's something that we always like to do, and this is what we've been doing since our inception. And on upstream energy, to your point, yes, we are hearing things people are feeling a little bit better. Oil prices are higher. I think some of the regions like the Permian are getting crowded, it's getting difficult to get product out. I think you're starting to see activity in other regions as pricing gets better. I would say, too, we probably saw a lot of what's called refrac-ing of wells, not a lot of new wells, not a lot of new completions when prices were lower. Now that prices are higher and they've kind of exhausted, I think a large backlog of existing wells, you've seen people do a little more work, a little more drilling, probably in the completions. And to your point, they see enough value that they're willing to expend more resources. So I think that it's a good sign, but we're still coming off a pretty low low. So we've been experiencing double-digit growth, but it's got a long way to go, and it remains to be seen if it can ever get back to the level it was. But I'd say friends are good. The customer sentiment seems to be pretty good, and we're seeing some nice roll up opportunities. And I'd say U.S. and Mexico is we're seeing much more of the opportunity right now as we said in the script."

So the combination of those 2 effects, you've got a larger decline in sort of your package and merchant, which is hurting the margin, and then you've got some improvement in the on-site, which might be at a below take-or-pay level. And that combination is creating, on a sequential basis, an unfavorable margin. So looking at year-over-year sometimes helps get the seasonality piece out. And year-over-year, we are a little better, as you see, but still got a long ways to go to get back to the levels that we've become accustomed to in prior years. So we've got a work cut out for us, but sequential or no seasonal effect, plus these pricing volumes and take-or-pay scenarios aren't doing a lot to help margins right now."

So I think the desire is there to run. It's profitable for them to run. So we see the right backdrop, and we've seen some good improvements. And then clearly, it'll just be as units come on and off with the various mills, but that's an area, I think, that the economics for our customer base seems good, and it seems to be more of a level playing field for them. So I think that outlook still remains fairly good."

First quarter results were quite strong with 10% sales and 20% EPS growth compared to prior year. Volume and price improvements were retained across every segment and end market, which supported an operating margin expansion of 140 basis points.
A little under half of the volume growth came from the startup of backlog projects in North America and Asia. In fact, 1/3 or $500 million started up in the first quarter this year, yet we held the backlog constant at $1.5 billion with new customer contract wins. So while the backlog may be steady, it is from continual turnover of new project wins replacing those that are removed due to starting up which clearly helps grow our earnings and returns.
And while the global team focused on delivering these results, we continued to make good progress on the merger with Linde. I'll speak to that more on an upcoming slide. But first, I'd like to provide a brief update of global business trends, which you can find on Slide 4.
North America is our second fastest-growing region supported by the industrial recovery in the U.S. Over half of the 4% volume growth was driven by improvements in chemicals from new investments starting up in the U.S. Gulf Coast and manufacturing as the U.S. package business continues to grow high single digits. And higher volumes in the metals, electronics and resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care more than offset a 1% decline related to customer turnarounds in the Gulf Coast.
There was modest recovery in the upstream energy business, especially in U.S. and Mexico, from increased well completion activity. However, this growth was from a very low base as volumes are still significantly below peak levels.
Overall pricing in the region has been improving along with inflation, enabling margin expansion over both prior year and the fourth quarter.
Project bidding opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains healthy. Despite the recent large startups, the current backlog has over $750 million of U.S. projects under construction, and we're still confident in winning new projects over the next several quarters.
South America continues to lag all of the regions and now comprises only 12% of global sales and 8% of global operating profit. Volume growth was slightly better than prior year but 3% lower than the fourth quarter due to the seasonal effects of Carnival and Easter holiday.
The primary driver of growth relates to on-site metals customers as their volumes ramped up to meet slightly higher demand. However, several of those customers are still below take-or-pay levels.
A combination of pricing and cost actions have enabled some margin expansion from prior year, but frankly, South America will remain a challenging place until there is more clarity around the direction of Brazilian politics.
Europe continues to be a steady, stable grower, with underlying growth rates improving 3%. Volume growth occurred across every major end market, although metals and manufacturing comprised half of the improvement with a pickup in industrial activity. Resilient markets also remain strong as we continue to identify new growth opportunities with the acquired CO2 business.
There are a few signs of inflation returning to the economy, primarily in the form of higher power costs, which are driving passthrough up 2% versus prior year. These trends are enabling some pricing opportunities up 1%, but more efforts are underway to recover the cost inflation.
Asia is our fastest-growing region, with sales up 21% and operating profit up 39% from 2017 first quarter. While foreign currency appreciation is driving about 7% of the growth, underlying conditions remain quite robust across China, India and Korea. The 11% higher volumes are roughly split between project startups and organic growth, with project startups supporting energy and electronics end markets and the industrial recovery supporting increases in chemicals, manufacturing and metals.
The pricing improvement of 3% primarily relates to merchant gases in China as structural supply challenges have eased with the closing of several liquefiers attached to Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills.
And earlier this week, we announced Praxair's single largest project win, where we will build, own and operate high-purity nitrogen plants for Samsung's newly constructed fab in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. In addition to this win, there are several other opportunities to support the growing demand for electronic devices.
And finally, in our PST business, aerospace continues to grow high single to low double digits, while oil and gas is making a modest recovery. Our aviation business has been making significant investments towards capacity expansion to serve the growing demand for aircraft engine coatings, and we anticipate continued ramping of revenues for the next several quarters.
So in summary, the synchronized industrial recovery, coupled with timely startups of the project backlog, have led to 5% volume growth, spread across every end market and segment. Furthermore, pockets of growing inflation have enabled higher pricing attainment in certain regions. The combination of the volume and price contribution have expanded overall operating margins for the fourth consecutive quarter. This backdrop, coupled with U.S. tax reform, appears to be supporting more customer capital investments and, thus, opportunity to increase our project backlog above the current $1.5 billion level.
Before Juan provides more details on the financial results, I'd like to offer a brief update on the merger with Linde, which you will find on Slide 5.
You may recall, at the start of this process, we defined 3 key phases required to complete the merger. The first 2 phases, defining the structure and value creation with the execution of the BCA and obtaining all necessary shareholder approvals through the Praxair vote and Linde tender, have both been achieved. As planned, we are now deep into the third phase, which includes obtaining appropriate regulatory approval and finalizing any relevant remedies associated with those approvals.
The slide shows a high-level time line of actions underway and milestones required to close the merger by the BaFin-mandated long stop date in October of this year. The joint team continues to have constructive dialogue with all regulators and is actively engaged with potential buyers of asset divestitures.
Overall, we feel quite good about our progress and ability to complete remaining milestones within the required time line. However, as you can imagine, this is a particularly important phase involving many outside parties, so I appreciate your understanding that we simply are not in a position at this time to answer any questions on merger progress or details of ongoing discussions with regulators or potential asset buyers. I fully expect that formal updates will occur at appropriate times when decisions become binding. But until then, the team is internally focused on the task at hand.
I'd now like to hand it off to Juan to review the first quarter results."

Sales of just under $3 billion were 10% higher than last year and up 2% sequentially. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance, and you can see the volume is the largest contributor with 5% growth versus last year.
When comparing to prior year, every major end market grew, led by chemicals, electronics and metals. From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the largest organic growth from a combination of continued recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, of our total volume, more than half came from the base business, and the rest was driven by project startups.
Sequentially, volumes are flat as first quarter is seasonally slower, primarily due to Lunar New Year and the timing of Easter. Furthermore, U.S. Gulf Coast customers underwent significant turnarounds, which offset the volume growth in the rest of our North American businesses.
In Europe, volumes grew sequentially 1%, led by the manufacturing end market, more specifically, in Spain and Germany. South America and Asia were seasonally weaker due to the holidays in the first quarter.
Sequentially, end market trends were also consistent with expectations as the industrial growth seen globally was offset by the energy drop in the turnarounds.
The price/mix improvement of 2% was achieved from focused price actions across all our segments, primarily led by Asia and North America. As mentioned earlier, Asian merchant had the strongest price attainment, led by China, where structural challenges have eased a couple of the growing economy.
Currency translation was favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and the Mexican peso.
Operating profit of $672 million was $99 million or 17% better than last year and $16 million or 2% better than the fourth quarter. Operating margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially, led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business, positive pricing, good volume growth and tightly managed costs.
Operating cash flow was $688 million, $22 million below prior year quarter, mainly driven by foreign withholding tax payments of $65 million in the first quarter.
Capital expenditures were $325 million, and as a result, our free cash flow was $363 million, which we used primarily to pay dividends and reduce net debt by $86 million. We fully expect an improvement in next quarter's cash flow, in line with prior trends.
Project backlog closed the quarter at $1.5 billion after starting up 3 new projects in the U.S., one of them being Yara Freeport. We also announced 2 new on-site project wins in South Korea for the electronics end market, which add up to $0.5 billion. As we continue with this backlog cadence of wins and startups, our incremental 3% EPS growth from project contribution will extend additional years.
Return on capital has steadily been rising for the past 4 quarters, now reaching 13%. As we continue to grow earnings, execute our backlog and manage cash generation, we expect our return on capital improving throughout 2018.
With that, now I'll turn the call back to Matt."

For the second quarter, EPS guidance range is $1.67 to $1.72, which represents 14% to 18% growth from last year. Year-over-year currency tailwind is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter as we begin to lap easier prior year comps, especially in the euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
The tax rate is still expected in the range of 23% to 25% and likely closer to the middle of that range, consistent with the first quarter.
Excluding tax and currency, this guidance represents a double-digit growth rate, driven by an assumption of similar levels of demand continuing through June.
To sum things up, we had a very good start to the year and are anticipating a continuation into the second quarter. The Praxair team has been able to capitalize on an industrial recovery through higher organic volume growth and securing new on-site contracts.
In addition, the recent reflation effect in certain economies has presented pricing opportunities that have not been present for several years. A combination of these factors should enable continued growth with positive operating margin expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen steel volumes tick up, not a lot of benefit to us given most of those were under take-or-pay. Usually, in my experience, when you see the infrastructure like metals and things start to ramp up, that tends to be a good sign of some form of an industrial recovery. But that all being said, the uncertainty around the elections -- and it's not just obviously Brazil, you have a similar situation in Colombia. You've got some situations going on politically in Peru. But I think when you add it all together, Brazil as the biggest one, we just won't have a lot of good idea in terms of how the politics will be run, how businesses will be viewed until the election in October. And right now, frankly, we're not even sure of the candidates. So when clarity comes around that, I think it could hopefully -- it'll have an effect on confidence one way or the other. But if it gives some confidence that there'll be a more, I'll say, business-friendly approach, I think you will start to see some investments. But I think most people are waiting, and it's probably prudent, and we'll just see. And so from that perspective, small improvements here and there. The resilient markets still continue to do well, and that was an area we had a lot of focus. But until then, we've been managing costs pretty tightly.

I think I got the first question, but the second one I may have to clarify because it kind of cut in and out a bit. But I will state this much on the squeeze out process. As I mentioned, it is a structured process, and my best understanding of how it works is that there will be a 3-month volume-weighted average price based 3 months back from the time of the announcement. And then there will be an independent, what's called an IDW S1, valuation. You may recall, one was done on the consolidated merger at the time of the filing of the S-4 and the tender offer. So both of those will be viewed as 2 different valuations, and the higher of those 2 will be determined.

When you get our Qs by the segment analysis, you'll be able to see the OP effect within each segment on FX. But for the most part, it follows the top line. Q2, and when we look at our FX, we lock in the forward rates at the beginning of the month. Clearly, rates have moved here over the last couple of weeks, so it's pretty volatile. But I would say, we expect definitely something less than 3% for Q2, partly because Q2 of last year, the rates were stronger, the foreign rates vis-à-vis the dollar, than they were in Q1, so the comps get tougher. But also, I'd say, rates, at least on a couple week basis here, have gotten a little weaker on the foreign. So the combination of that 2 will put it something below 3%, could be 2%, could be 1%, based on where we're at now remains to be seen."

And then, specifically, on the backlog and certainly an opportunity like Freeport now is up and running, that's a pretty new hub for you. Just wondering how you see the opportunities in that sort of area developing given you have [ the signature ]. And then the last question, on the upstream energy, you pointed it coming off the bottom now. Certainly, some of the specialty chem players are indicating that their customers potentially might loosen on the cost consciousness they've had and might be spending a bit more money to get the oil and gas out or more of the oil and gas out.

So I'll try to take them in order here. The first question on the backlog. The challenge, I think, of trying to project the split between, we call it, U.S. chemicals and refining North America versus Asian electronics is the project sizes are so lumpy, right? So the timing of when the projects come in could skew that. We still see a lot of quite large projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast as new opportunities, and they're both refining and petchem opportunities. With Asia, clearly, to your point, we've added some large electronics. There are others out there as well. So it depends on timing. I think we'll probably see a little more move back to U.S. and refining and energy in the coming quarters just based on where things are, but it just remains to be seen on the timing and when things are ultimately signed. But we feel pretty good about the trend on both. And frankly, I'm indifferent which one we get as long as these projects meet our criteria, which they do. So -- on Freeport, yes, we clearly feel good about having those assets there. Any time you have an opportunity to extend your network into a region and bring both atmospheric and process gases, we see as a very good thing. And so we continue to find some incremental opportunities off that, which we're pursuing. And we just continue to look for ways to extend the network. So I think it's something that we always like to do, and this is what we've been doing since our inception. And on upstream energy, to your point, yes, we are hearing things, people feeling a little bit better. Oil prices are higher. I think some of the regions like the Permian are getting crowded. It's getting more difficult to get product out. I think you're starting to see activity in other regions as pricing gets better. I would say, too, we probably saw a lot of what's called re-fracking of wells, not a lot of new wells, not a lot of new completions when prices were lower. Now that prices are higher and they've kind of exhausted, I think, a large backlog of existing wells, you've seen people do a little more work, a little more drilling, probably new completions. And to your point, they see enough value that they're willing to expend more resources. So I think that it's a good sign, but we're still coming off a pretty low, low. So we've been experiencing double-digit growth, but it's got a long way to go, and it remains to be seen if it can ever get back to the level it was. But I'd say trends are good. The customer sentiment seems to be pretty good, and we're seeing some nice roll-up opportunities. And I'd say U.S. and Mexico is where we're seeing much more of the opportunity right now, as we said in the script."

So to your point, you're getting top line but not really much margin on it.

So the combination of those 2 effects, you've got a larger decline in sort of your packaged and merchant, which is hurting the margin, and then you've got some improvement in the on-site, which might be at a below take-or-pay level. And that combination is creating, on a sequential basis, an unfavorable margin. So looking at year-over-year sometimes helps get the seasonality piece out. And year-over-year, we are a little better, as you see, but still got a long ways to go to get back to the levels that we've become accustomed to in prior years.

We've got some pretty good year-over-year margin leverage for this first quarter. So this is something that we want to just make sure we capture. And the key is that we don't lose it, right? We don't allow cost inflation to offset it, and that's something that there's a lot of focus in the organization to ensure. So I think there is more opportunity. I think there's more improvement. I mean, I look at something like South America. When you look at it by region, South American margins are some of the lowest they've been.

First quarter results were quite strong with 10% sales and 20% EPS growth compared to prior year. Volume and price improvements were obtained across every segment and end market, which supported an operating margin expansion of 140 basis points.
A little under half of the volume growth came from the startup of backlog projects in North America and Asia. In fact, 1/3 or $500 million started up in the first quarter this year, yet we held the backlog constant at $1.5 billion with new customer contract wins. So while the backlog may be steady, it is from continual turnover of new project wins replacing those that are removed due to starting up which clearly helps grow our earnings and returns.
And while the global team focused on delivering these results, we continued to make good progress on the merger with Linde. I'll speak to that more on an upcoming slide. But first, I'd like to provide a brief update of global business trends, which you can find on Slide 4.
North America is our second fastest-growing region supported by the industrial recovery in the U.S. Over half of the 4% volume growth was driven by improvements in chemicals from new investments starting up in the U.S. Gulf Coast and manufacturing as the U.S. package business continues to grow high single digits. And higher volumes in the metals, electronics and resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care more than offset a 1% decline related to customer turnarounds in the Gulf Coast.
There was modest recovery in the upstream energy business, especially in U.S. and Mexico, from increased well completion activity. However, this growth was from a very low base as volumes are still significantly below peak levels.
Overall pricing in the region has been improving along with inflation, enabling margin expansion over both prior year and the fourth quarter.
Project bidding opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains healthy. Despite the recent large startups, the current backlog has over $750 million of U.S. projects under construction, and we're still confident in winning new projects over the next several quarters.
South America continues to lag all of the regions and now comprises only 12% of global sales and 8% of global operating profit. Volume growth was slightly better than prior year but 3% lower than the fourth quarter due to the seasonal effects of Carnival and Easter holiday.
The primary driver of growth relates to on-site metals customers as their volumes ramped up to meet slightly higher demand. However, several of those customers are still below take-or-pay levels.
A combination of pricing and cost actions have enabled some margin expansion from prior year, but frankly, South America will remain a challenging place until there is more clarity around the direction of Brazilian politics.
Europe continues to be a steady, stable grower, with underlying growth rates improving 3%. Volume growth occurred across every major end market, although metals and manufacturing comprised half of the improvement with a pickup in industrial activity. Resilient markets also remain strong as we continue to identify new growth opportunities with the acquired CO2 business.
There are a few signs of inflation returning to the economy, primarily in the form of higher power costs, which are driving passthrough up 2% versus prior year. These trends are enabling some pricing opportunities up 1%, but more efforts are underway to recover the cost inflation.
Asia is our fastest-growing region, with sales up 21% and operating profit up 39% from 2017 first quarter. While foreign currency appreciation is driving about 7% of the growth, underlying conditions remain quite robust across China, India and Korea. The 11% higher volumes are roughly split between project startups and organic growth, with project startups supporting energy and electronics end markets and the industrial recovery supporting increases in chemicals, manufacturing and metals.
The pricing improvement of 3% primarily relates to merchant gases in China as structural supply challenges have eased with the closing of several liquefiers attached to Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills.
And earlier this week, we announced Praxair's single largest project win, where we will build, own and operate high-purity nitrogen plants for Samsung's newly constructed fab in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. In addition to this win, there are several other opportunities to support the growing demand for electronic devices.
And finally, in our PST business, aerospace continues to grow high single to low double digits, while oil and gas is making a modest recovery. Our aviation business has been making significant investments towards capacity expansion to serve the growing demand for aircraft engine coatings, and we anticipate continued ramping of revenues for the next several quarters.
So in summary, the synchronized industrial recovery, coupled with timely startups of the project backlog, have led to 5% volume growth, spread across every end market and segment. Furthermore, pockets of growing inflation have enabled higher pricing attainment in certain regions. The combination of the volume and price contribution have expanded overall operating margins for the fourth consecutive quarter. This backdrop, coupled with U.S. tax reform, appears to be supporting more customer capital investments and, thus, opportunity to increase our project backlog above the current $1.5 billion level.
Before Juan provides more details on the financial results, I'd like to offer a brief update on the merger with Linde, which you will find on Slide 5.
You may recall, at the start of this process, we defined 3 key phases required to complete the merger. The first 2 phases, defining the structure and value creation with the execution of the BCA and obtaining all necessary shareholder approvals through the Praxair vote and Linde tender, have both been achieved. As planned, we are now deep into the third phase, which includes obtaining appropriate regulatory approval and finalizing any relevant remedies associated with those approvals.
The slide shows a high-level time line of actions underway and milestones required to close the merger by the BaFin-mandated long stop date in October of this year. The joint team continues to have constructive dialogue with all regulators and is actively engaged with potential buyers of asset divestitures.
Overall, we feel quite good about our progress and ability to complete remaining milestones within the required time line. However, as you can imagine, this is a particularly important phase involving many outside parties, so I appreciate your understanding that we simply are not in a position at this time to answer any questions on merger progress or details of ongoing discussions with regulators or potential asset buyers. I fully expect that formal updates will occur at appropriate times when decisions become binding. But until then, the team is internally focused on the task at hand.
I'd now like to hand it off to Juan to review the first quarter results."

Sales of just under $3 billion were 10% higher than last year and up 2% sequentially. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance, and you can see the volume is the largest contributor with 5% growth versus last year.
When comparing to prior year, every major end market grew, led by chemicals, electronics and metals. From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the largest organic growth from a combination of continued recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, of our total volume, more than half came from the base business, and the rest was driven by project startups.
Sequentially, volumes are flat as first quarter is seasonally slower, primarily due to Lunar New Year and the timing of Easter. Furthermore, U.S. Gulf Coast customers underwent significant turnarounds, which offset the volume growth in the rest of our North American businesses.
In Europe, volumes grew sequentially 1%, led by the manufacturing end market, more specifically, in Spain and Germany. South America and Asia were seasonally weaker due to the holidays in the first quarter.
Sequentially, end market trends were also consistent with expectations as the industrial growth seen globally was offset by the energy drop in the turnarounds.
The price/mix improvement of 2% was achieved from focused price actions across all our segments, primarily led by Asia and North America. As mentioned earlier, Asian merchant had the strongest price attainment, led by China, where structural challenges have eased coupled with a growing economy.
Currency translation was favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and the Mexican peso.
Operating profit of $672 million was $99 million or 17% better than last year and $16 million or 2% better than the fourth quarter. Operating margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially, led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business, positive pricing, good volume growth and tightly managed costs.
Operating cash flow was $688 million, $22 million below prior year quarter, mainly driven by foreign withholding tax payments of $65 million in the first quarter.
Capital expenditures were $325 million, and as a result, our free cash flow was $363 million, which we used primarily to pay dividends and reduce net debt by $86 million. We fully expect an improvement in next quarter's cash flow, in line with prior trends.
Project backlog closed the quarter at $1.5 billion after starting up 3 new projects in the U.S., one of them being Yara Freeport. We also announced 2 new on-site project wins in South Korea for the electronics end market, which add up to $0.5 billion. As we continue with this backlog cadence of wins and startups, our incremental 3% EPS growth from project contribution will extend additional years.
Return on capital has steadily been rising for the past 4 quarters, now reaching 13%. As we continue to grow earnings, execute our backlog and manage cash generation, we expect our return on capital improving throughout 2018.
With that, now I'll turn the call back to Matt."

For the second quarter, EPS guidance range is $1.67 to $1.72, which represents 14% to 18% growth from last year. Year-over-year currency tailwind is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter as we begin to lap easier prior year comps, especially in the euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
The tax rate is still expected in the range of 23% to 25% and likely closer to the middle of that range, consistent with the first quarter.
Excluding tax and currency, this guidance represents a double-digit growth rate, driven by an assumption of similar levels of demand continuing through June.
To sum things up, we had a very good start to the year and are anticipating a continuation into the second quarter. The Praxair team has been able to capitalize on an industrial recovery through higher organic volume growth and securing new on-site contracts.
In addition, the recent reflation effect in certain economies has presented pricing opportunities that have not been present for several years. A combination of these factors should enable continued growth with positive operating margin expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

Obviously, sequential will be affected by the normal seasonal declines. So when you look year-over-year, a little bit of improvement. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen steel volumes tick up, not a lot of benefit to us given most of those were under take-or-pay. Usually, in my experience, when you see the infrastructure like metals and things start to ramp up, that tends to be a good sign of some form of an industrial recovery. But that all being said, the uncertainty around the elections -- and it's not just obviously Brazil, you have a similar situation in Colombia. You've got some situations going on politically in Peru. But I think when you add it all together, Brazil as the biggest one, we just won't have a lot of good idea in terms of how the politics will be run, how businesses will be viewed until the election in October. And right now, frankly, we're not even sure of the candidates. So when clarity comes around that, I think it could hopefully -- it'll have an effect on confidence one way or the other. But if it gives some confidence that there'll be a more, I'll say, business-friendly approach, I think you will start to see some investments. But I think most people are waiting, and it's probably prudent, and we'll just see. And so from that perspective, small improvements here and there. The resilient markets still continue to do well, and that was an area we had a lot of focus. But until then, we've been managing costs pretty tightly. We are getting some price, and we just got to work through these next quarters until there's more clarity."

But we're seeing improvements in our cylinder gases, dry ice. We're seeing a lot of improvements in Tier 2 auto. Aerospace continues to be quite strong. So I would say it's across the board. And we are seeing some pickup in upstream oil a little bit as well. That's something coming off a low base, but that's also an area where we're seeing some improved growth. So there's no one market I could point to right now. And when you look at the industrial production in the U.S., I think that's been boding well for a lot of these packaged end markets. You're just seeing it across the board. So we feel pretty good, especially the remainder of this year, in our packaged business. I think the numbers continue to be strong, and it's been a nice run. And as we said in the past, when that business recovers, it recovers with some fairly good leverage, and that's what we've been experiencing. So we've been quite happy with that as well."

When you get our Qs by the segment analysis, you'll be able to see the OP effect within each segment on FX. But for the most part, it follows the top line. Q2, and when we look at our FX, we lock in the forward rates at the beginning of the month. Clearly, rates have moved here over the last couple of weeks, so it's pretty volatile. But I would say, we expect definitely something less than 3% for Q2, partly because Q2 of last year, the rates were stronger, the foreign rates vis-à-vis the dollar, than they were in Q1, so the comps get tougher. But also, I'd say, rates, at least on a couple week basis here, have gotten a little weaker on the foreign. So the combination of that 2 will put it something below 3%, could be 2%, could be 1%, based on where we're at now remains to be seen."

But the combined margins are something you would expect of a distributor a little better, frankly, given the gas that we have. But it's a good business, and it brings a lot of nice contribution for us. So when we find opportunistic acquisitions and ones that we can justify on synergies, we absolutely will continue to do them.

Because you also actually pointed at more Asian signatures potentially. And then, specifically, on the backlog and certainly an opportunity like Freeport now is up and running, that's a pretty new hub for you. Just wondering how you see the opportunities in that sort of area developing given you have [ the signature ]. And then the last question, on the upstream energy, you pointed it coming off the bottom now. Certainly, some of the specialty chem players are indicating that their customers potentially might loosen on the cost consciousness they've had and might be spending a bit more money to get the oil and gas out or more of the oil and gas out. Just wondering if that's your feeling on fracking gases, if there's some momentum here that we can see during the year."

So I'll try to take them in order here. The first question on the backlog. The challenge, I think, of trying to project the split between, we'll call it, U.S. chemicals and refining North America versus Asian electronics is the project sizes are so lumpy, right? So the timing of when the projects come in could skew that. We still see a lot of quite large projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast as new opportunities, and they're both refining and petchem opportunities. With Asia, clearly, to your point, we've added some large electronics. There are others out there as well. So it depends on timing. I think we'll probably see a little more move back to U.S. and refining and energy in the coming quarters just based on where things are, but it just remains to be seen on the timing and when things are ultimately signed. But we feel pretty good about the trend on both. And frankly, I'm indifferent which one we get as long as these projects meet our criteria, which they do. So -- on Freeport, yes, we clearly feel good about having those assets there. Any time you have an opportunity to extend your network into a region and bring both atmospheric and process gases, we see as a very good thing. And so we continue to find some incremental opportunities off that, which we're pursuing. And we just continue to look for ways to extend the network. So I think it's something that we always like to do, and this is what we've been doing since our inception. And on upstream energy, to your point, yes, we are hearing things, people feeling a little bit better. Oil prices are higher. I think some of the regions like the Permian are getting crowded. It's getting more difficult to get product out. I think you're starting to see activity in other regions as pricing gets better. I would say, too, we probably saw a lot of what's called re-fracking of wells, not a lot of new wells, not a lot of new completions when prices were lower. Now that prices are higher and they've kind of exhausted, I think, a large backlog of existing wells, you've seeing people do a little more work, a little more drilling, probably new completions. And to your point, they see enough value that they're willing to expend more resources. So I think that it's a good sign, but we're still coming off a pretty low, low. So we've been experiencing double-digit growth, but it's got a long way to go, and it remains to be seen if it can ever get back to the level it was. But I'd say trends are good. The customer sentiment seems to be pretty good, and we're seeing some nice roll-up opportunities. And I'd say U.S. and Mexico is where we're seeing much more of the opportunity right now, as we said in the script."

So to your point, you're getting top line but not really much margin on it.

So the combination of those 2 effects, you've got a larger decline in sort of your packaged and merchant, which is hurting the margin, and then you've got some improvement in the on-site, which might be at a below take-or-pay level. And that combination is creating, on a sequential basis, an unfavorable margin. So looking at year-over-year sometimes helps get the seasonality piece out. And year-over-year, we are a little better, as you see, but still got a long ways to go to get back to the levels that we've become accustomed to in prior years.

Regarding logistics costs, it's exactly what you said. It will be a combination. Some will be surcharging contractually. Some will just be pricing, depends on the contract, depends on the product.

First quarter results were quite strong with 10% sales and 20% EPS growth compared to prior year. Volume and price improvements were obtained across every segment and end market, which supported an operating margin expansion of 140 basis points.
A little under half of the volume growth came from the startup of backlog projects in North America and Asia. In fact, 1/3 or $500 million started up in the first quarter this year, yet we held the backlog constant at $1.5 billion with new customer contract wins. So while the backlog may be steady, it is from continual turnover of new project wins replacing those that are removed due to starting up which clearly helps grow our earnings and returns.
And while the global team focused on delivering these results, we continued to make good progress on the merger with Linde. I'll speak to that more on an upcoming slide. But first, I'd like to provide a brief update of global business trends, which you can find on Slide 4.
North America is our second fastest-growing region supported by the industrial recovery in the U.S. Over half of the 4% volume growth was driven by improvements in chemicals from new investments starting up in the U.S. Gulf Coast and manufacturing as the U.S. package business continues to grow high single digits. And higher volumes in the metals, electronics and resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care more than offset a 1% decline related to customer turnarounds in the Gulf Coast.
There was modest recovery in the upstream energy business, especially in U.S. and Mexico, from increased well completion activity. However, this growth was from a very low base as volumes are still significantly below peak levels.
Overall pricing in the region has been improving along with inflation, enabling margin expansion over both prior year and the fourth quarter.
Project bidding opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains healthy. Despite the recent large startups, the current backlog has over $750 million of U.S. projects under construction, and we're still confident in winning new projects over the next several quarters.
South America continues to lag all of the regions and now comprises only 12% of global sales and 8% of global operating profit. Volume growth was slightly better than prior year but 3% lower than the fourth quarter due to the seasonal effects of Carnival and Easter holiday.
The primary driver of growth relates to on-site metals customers as their volumes ramped up to meet slightly higher demand. However, several of those customers are still below take-or-pay levels.
A combination of pricing and cost actions have enabled some margin expansion from prior year, but frankly, South America will remain a challenging place until there is more clarity around the direction of Brazilian politics.
Europe continues to be a steady, stable grower, with underlying growth rates improving 3%. Volume growth occurred across every major end market, although metals and manufacturing comprised half of the improvement with a pickup in industrial activity. Resilient markets also remain strong as we continue to identify new growth opportunities with the acquired CO2 business.
There are a few signs of inflation returning to the economy, primarily in the form of higher power costs, which are driving passthrough up 2% versus prior year. These trends are enabling some pricing opportunities up 1%, but more efforts are underway to recover the cost inflation.
Asia is our fastest-growing region, with sales up 21% and operating profit up 39% from 2017 first quarter. While foreign currency appreciation is driving about 7% of the growth, underlying conditions remain quite robust across China, India and Korea. The 11% higher volumes are roughly split between project startups and organic growth, with project startups supporting energy and electronics end markets and the industrial recovery supporting increases in chemicals, manufacturing and metals.
The pricing improvement of 3% primarily relates to merchant gases in China as structural supply challenges have eased with the closing of several liquefiers attached to Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills.
And earlier this week, we announced Praxair's single largest project win, where we will build, own and operate high-purity nitrogen plants for Samsung's newly constructed fab in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. In addition to this win, there are several other opportunities to support the growing demand for electronic devices.
And finally, in our PST business, aerospace continues to grow high single to low double digits, while oil and gas is making a modest recovery. Our aviation business has been making significant investments towards capacity expansion to serve the growing demand for aircraft engine coatings, and we anticipate continued ramping of revenues for the next several quarters.
So in summary, the synchronized industrial recovery, coupled with timely startups of the project backlog, have led to 5% volume growth, spread across every end market and segment. Furthermore, pockets of growing inflation have enabled higher pricing attainment in certain regions. The combination of the volume and price contribution have expanded overall operating margins for the fourth consecutive quarter. This backdrop, coupled with U.S. tax reform, appears to be supporting more customer capital investments and, thus, opportunity to increase our project backlog above the current $1.5 billion level.
Before Juan provides more details on the financial results, I'd like to offer a brief update on the merger with Linde, which you will find on Slide 5.
You may recall, at the start of this process, we defined 3 key phases required to complete the merger. The first 2 phases, defining the structure and value creation with the execution of the BCA and obtaining all necessary shareholder approvals through the Praxair vote and Linde tender, have both been achieved. As planned, we are now deep into the third phase, which includes obtaining appropriate regulatory approval and finalizing any relevant remedies associated with those approvals.
The slide shows a high-level time line of actions underway and milestones required to close the merger by the BaFin-mandated long stop date in October of this year. The joint team continues to have constructive dialogue with all regulators and is actively engaged with potential buyers of asset divestitures.
Overall, we feel quite good about our progress and ability to complete remaining milestones within the required time line. However, as you can imagine, this is a particularly important phase involving many outside parties, so I appreciate your understanding that we simply are not in a position at this time to answer any questions on merger progress or details of ongoing discussions with regulators or potential asset buyers. I fully expect that formal updates will occur at appropriate times when decisions become binding. But until then, the team is internally focused on the task at hand.
I'd now like to hand it off to Juan to review the first quarter results."

Sales of just under $3 billion were 10% higher than last year and up 2% sequentially. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance, and you can see the volume is the largest contributor with 5% growth versus last year.
When comparing to prior year, every major end market grew, led by chemicals, electronics and metals. From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the largest organic growth from a combination of continued recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, of our total volume, more than half came from the base business, and the rest was driven by project startups.
Sequentially, volumes are flat as first quarter is seasonally slower, primarily due to Lunar New Year and the timing of Easter. Furthermore, U.S. Gulf Coast customers underwent significant turnarounds, which offset the volume growth in the rest of our North American businesses.
In Europe, volumes grew sequentially 1%, led by the manufacturing end market, more specifically, in Spain and Germany. South America and Asia were seasonally weaker due to the holidays in the first quarter.
Sequentially, end market trends were also consistent with expectations as the industrial growth seen globally was offset by the energy drop in the turnarounds.
The price/mix improvement of 2% was achieved from focused price actions across all our segments, primarily led by Asia and North America. As mentioned earlier, Asian merchant had the strongest price attainment, led by China, where structural challenges have eased coupled with a growing economy.
Currency translation was favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and the Mexican peso.
Operating profit of $672 million was $99 million or 17% better than last year and $16 million or 2% better than the fourth quarter. Operating margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially, led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business, positive pricing, good volume growth and tightly managed costs.
Operating cash flow was $688 million, $22 million below prior year quarter, mainly driven by foreign withholding tax payments of $65 million in the first quarter.
Capital expenditures were $325 million, and as a result, our free cash flow was $363 million, which we used primarily to pay dividends and reduce net debt by $86 million. We fully expect an improvement in next quarter's cash flow, in line with prior trends.
Project backlog closed the quarter at $1.5 billion after starting up 3 new projects in the U.S., one of them being Yara Freeport. We also announced 2 new on-site project wins in South Korea for the electronics end market, which add up to $0.5 billion. As we continue with this backlog cadence of wins and startups, our incremental 3% EPS growth from project contribution will extend additional years.
Return on capital has steadily been rising for the past 4 quarters, now reaching 13%. As we continue to grow earnings, execute our backlog and manage cash generation, we expect our return on capital improving throughout 2018.
With that, now I'll turn the call back to Matt."

For the second quarter, EPS guidance range is $1.67 to $1.72, which represents 14% to 18% growth from last year. Year-over-year currency tailwind is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter as we begin to lap easier prior year comps, especially in the euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
The tax rate is still expected in the range of 23% to 25% and likely closer to the middle of that range, consistent with the first quarter.
Excluding tax and currency, this guidance represents a double-digit growth rate, driven by an assumption of similar levels of demand continuing through June.
To sum things up, we had a very good start to the year and are anticipating a continuation into the second quarter. The Praxair team has been able to capitalize on an industrial recovery through higher organic volume growth and securing new on-site contracts.
In addition, the recent reflation effect in certain economies has presented pricing opportunities that have not been present for several years. A combination of these factors should enable continued growth with positive operating margin expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

But I think when you add it all together, Brazil as the biggest one, we just won't have a lot of good idea in terms of how the politics will be run, how businesses will be viewed until the election in October. And right now, frankly, we're not even sure of the candidates. So when clarity comes around that, I think it could hopefully -- it'll have an effect on confidence one way or the other. But if it gives some confidence that there'll be a more, I'll say, business-friendly approach, I think you will start to see some investments. But I think most people are waiting, and it's probably prudent, and we'll just see. And so from that perspective, small improvements here and there. The resilient markets still continue to do well, and that was an area we had a lot of focus. But until then, we've been managing costs pretty tightly. We are getting some price, and we just got to work through these next quarters until there's more clarity."

When you get our Qs by the segment analysis, you'll be able to see the OP effect within each segment on FX. But for the most part, it follows the top line. Q2, and when we look at our FX, we lock in the forward rates at the beginning of the month. Clearly, rates have moved here over the last couple of weeks, so it's pretty volatile. But I would say, we expect definitely something less than 3% for Q2, partly because Q2 of last year, the rates were stronger, the foreign rates vis-à-vis the dollar, than they were in Q1, so the comps get tougher. But also, I'd say, rates, at least on a couple week basis here, have gotten a little weaker on the foreign. So the combination of that 2 will put it something below 3%, could be 2%, could be 1%, based on where we're at now remains to be seen."

Just wondering how you see the opportunities in that sort of area developing given you have [ the signature ]. And then the last question, on the upstream energy, you pointed it coming off the bottom now. Certainly, some of the specialty chem players are indicating that their customers potentially might loosen on the cost consciousness they've had and might be spending a bit more money to get the oil and gas out or more of the oil and gas out.

So I'll try to take them in order here. The first question on the backlog. The challenge, I think, of trying to project the split between, we'll call it, U.S. chemicals and refining North America versus Asian electronics is the project sizes are so lumpy, right? So the timing of when the projects come in could skew that. We still see a lot of quite large projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast as new opportunities, and they're both refining and petchem opportunities. With Asia, clearly, to your point, we've added some large electronics. There are others out there as well. So it depends on timing. I think we'll probably see a little more move back to U.S. and refining and energy in the coming quarters just based on where things are, but it just remains to be seen on the timing and when things are ultimately signed. But we feel pretty good about the trend on both. And frankly, I'm indifferent which one we get as long as these projects meet our criteria, which they do. So -- on Freeport, yes, we clearly feel good about having those assets there. Any time you have an opportunity to extend your network into a region and bring both atmospheric and process gases, we see as a very good thing. And so we continue to find some incremental opportunities off that, which we're pursuing. And we just continue to look for ways to extend the network. So I think it's something that we always like to do, and this is what we've been doing since our inception. And on upstream energy, to your point, yes, we are hearing things, people feeling a little bit better. Oil prices are higher. I think some of the regions like the Permian are getting crowded. It's getting more difficult to get product out. I think you're starting to see activity in other regions as pricing gets better. I would say, too, we probably saw a lot of what's called re-fracking of wells, not a lot of new wells, not a lot of new completions when prices were lower. Now that prices are higher and they've kind of exhausted, I think, a large backlog of existing wells, you've seeing people do a little more work, a little more drilling, probably new completions. And to your point, they see enough value that they're willing to expend more resources. So I think that it's a good sign, but we're still coming off a pretty low, low. So we've been experiencing double-digit growth, but it's got a long way to go, and it remains to be seen if it can ever get back to the level it was. But I'd say trends are good. The customer sentiment seems to be pretty good, and we're seeing some nice roll-up opportunities. And I'd say U.S. and Mexico is where we're seeing much more of the opportunity right now, as we said in the script."

And in addition, with the normal seasonal patterns with Carnival and Easter and -- what we tend to see is you see a lot less merchant and packaged gases just because of normal seasonal shutdowns, which tend to be more favorable margin products. So the combination of those 2 effects, you've got a larger decline in sort of your packaged and merchant, which is hurting the margin, and then you've got some improvement in the on-site, which might be at a below take-or-pay level. And that combination is creating, on a sequential basis, an unfavorable margin. So looking at year-over-year sometimes helps get the seasonality piece out. And year-over-year, we are a little better, as you see, but still got a long ways to go to get back to the levels that we've become accustomed to in prior years. So we've got to work that out for us, but that sequential seasonal effect, plus these rising volumes in take-or-pay scenarios, aren't doing a lot to help margins right now."

We've got some pretty good year-over-year margin leverage for this first quarter. So this is something that we want to just make sure we capture. And the key is that we don't lose it, right? We don't allow cost inflation to offset it, and that's something that there's a lot of focus in the organization to ensure. So I think there is more opportunity. I think there's more improvement. I mean, I look at something like South America. When you look at it by region, South American margins are some of the lowest they've been. So any kind of improvement there will clearly help the overall margins.

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increase",1215,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation. The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital which is 150 basis points better than last year.
The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives including pricing cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continue to position ourselves for future growth by winning 3 new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts. 
Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends especially in North America and Asia, which are 2 of the best-performing regions. 
The North American segment had 52% of sales, have steadily improved 7 quarters in a row as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high single to double digits for both cylinder gases and our goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America have supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes. 
Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project startups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customers run rate improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continued to grow in line with demographic trends. The North American energy market was softer versus prior year as we experienced a few customer outages which have since returned to normal run rates.
Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. 
Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.
Asia is the fastest-growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth, but we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the startup of our CNOOC project. The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed 2 new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets. 
The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. 
Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation. Also in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running. So we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3. 
As anticipated, the South America segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. 
Fiscal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.
The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24%, respectively. You may recall last quarter the ramp-up cost incurred to increase quota capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.
So in summary, I'd say we are firing on 4 out of 5 cylinders, as strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high quality business but we've also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on Slide 5. 
The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to 2 major areas: first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements; and second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. 
As you've seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are 6 remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long stop date.
In addition Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. 
In parallel with trust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date. Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day 1 readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine, with the merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.
Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process. So I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions. I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results."

Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year, volume was the largest contributor, with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project startups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way. 
Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past 6 quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches as well as coding to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.
Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe, and North America in both merchant and packaged. Sequentially, volume growth of 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. 
In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region. Currency translation was flat year-over-year but negative 2% sequentially as major currencies weakened versus U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy, coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty, have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate will continue through the back half of the year. 
Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.
Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million, which was used to pay dividends and reduce net debt below $8 billion, the lowest levels since 2012 prior to the new CO2 acquisition. 
Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up 2 large ASUs to serve CNOOC in China and winning 3 on-site projects, 2 in Asia and 1 in North America. Other total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance the aerospace and manufacturing end markets. 
Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start up in 2019 but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.
As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018. With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook."

At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude, CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.
The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for the second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance which quickly evaporated to 0%. 
Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4% as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. 
Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full year approached taken this January. Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to creating new, more valuable company. I would now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I would say, as you know, our South American business a little more than 3/4 would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more of just a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good but it's getting drowned outlook with some of the currency effects. Now within Brazil, clearly, the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying, what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly, we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals. As you're seeing more metals being produced, now part of that is for export. With the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally, but I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some. But it really until the election, it's going to be hard to see. As you may recall, in North America, when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back 4 years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then, over time, merchant and then packaged. In Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and packaged really turning the corner. Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies. But frankly, until the October election, it's going to be tough. I think we got to really have to see what happens in 2019. And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When Amlo was elected, there are, obviously, some views and concerns. But when he came out announced kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell."

I would say more than just the last 6 months, we had a period of stagflation there for a bit of time. And so from that perspective -- which is very small for us, by the way, the packaged and merchant.

And what we're seeing, and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers, is a nice rhythm of startups and replacements, startups and replacements. From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that's constantly churning. A growing backlog can be good but we need to make sure we're starting them up. So right now we're having large startups. As you know, we had a very large startup in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects. And as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that's a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful. So we feel very good.

We had laid out back on our strategy probably 4 years ago, that based on our backlog, we anticipated 3% EPS. And we stuck with EPS because, as you know, each contract could be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported but we said the 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out 3-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next 3 to 4 years based on this current backlog. Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that, but this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog, which is where we still are right now give or take. So I'd say yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next 3 to 4 years. And if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years. From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago, were for natural -- reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas-fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that. Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets anyone using higher cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid. But more what I would say we're seeing displace that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction. By burning in a better environment, you can reduce that, and you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into, even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental. So I would say the original main drivers have shifted but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency."

What we're probably seeing is mid-single-digit plus on gas and we're still double-digit on hardgoods right now. And it's funny I asked the same question internally here, and the answer is it's still as pretty broad based. Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding, shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well, but we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets. Some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics. So it still is pretty broad-based, and packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production and especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories. So at this point, there's no one market I could point to that I would say is more strong or weaker than the other, but it's fairly broad based."

We're getting up to, say, mid-70s now for LIN and LOX, argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that -- it's a little tighter in some areas but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand. That continues to be strong across several countries in Asia. I'd say trends are going well but we're able to get good utilization out of our asset base globally, but clearly, we have room to expand if needed in all of our markets."

And as you can imagine, part of that pass-through is both power and fluorine and refrigerants and also some of that price. So it's a combination of packaged gas is in our refrigerant business in Southern Europe. But I would say that I don't know I could call it a leader, but I would say packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated to inflation. As you know, in packaged, the contracts are not very long. They could be 1, 2, 3 years or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster. And in some cases, especially hardgoods, where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hardgoods, these hardgoods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation. So you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hardgoods' higher costs. So it's a combination, I'd say, of all that but. So I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied, timing-wise, to inflation, given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hardgoods and gases."

Could be a little bit lower because, as you know, this year, we had a couple of large startups including our largest project ever. So I think the startup next year we still believe will overall reach that 3% number in that range I talked about before for EPS growth, but the backlog reduction somewhere in that neighborhood of 1/3 or maybe a little less. As far as the ones we've won, chemicals and electronics primarily, as we have mentioned, when you looked at the U.S., still seeing strong chemicals activity across the spectrum, and so investments continue to be made and this was an asset related to that investment. And in Asia, 1 in chemicals and 1 in electronics. So as we had mentioned in prior calls these continue to be kind of the strongest end markets, primarily in Asia and North America, as you know, and we continue to see good opportunities. And if I look at our pre-backlog, the major 3 markets related to that are still electronics, chemicals and energy, to an extent. Those are, right now, I would say, probably in the best build cycle.

As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that. So these are aspects that you could track to recover. And so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually 2, 3 months, but that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers, but this is not, I would say, anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy, especially in the United States, is going. When the economy is going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers. And when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general. So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned, of in-house drivers versus outsourced of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable. Clearly, they got to meet our safety standards and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it would take some time for us to get them to be the right drivers, but it's something we're used to. We got a great team that does this day in and day out. And from my perspective, while it's challenging, while it's tough, there's nothing I've seen overly concerning about this current trend versus any prior trends."

There are some tightness of certain products and I think that is driving a little bit of the inflation as well. And so our team's done a good job to go out there and get back some of this pent-up inflation, and power has been a big area. You may recall when you look at pass-through with 4% this quarter, I think last quarter, we were similar number low single digits. So we've started to see power, as I'd say, the initial area of inflation and it's kind of creeping through in other areas. So our team needed to get ahead of it, and they did. So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for CO2. So we had the outages during the difficult time.

You go back last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in the -- what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity in the nonindustrial gas, meaning steel mills that have byproduct coming off of their captive plants. So this drove both -- not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand. And pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the year since had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid- to high single digits. The pricing, and you just look back at our history, was not reflected of that. So I would say at this point now, you had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity is especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills have been shuttered. Remains to see how much more of that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed but you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect. I mean because you got to remember, in China, it had some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that into consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, was one of our biggest imports. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements."

318049,573252084,1509599,"Praxair, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increase",1215,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation. The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital, which is 150 basis points better than last year.
The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives including pricing cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continue to position ourselves for future growth by winning 3 new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts. 
Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends especially in North America and Asia, which are 2 of the best-performing regions. 
The North American segment had 52% of sales, has steadily improved several quarters in a row as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high single to double digits for both cylinder gases and our goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America has supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes. 
Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project start-ups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customer run rates improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continued to grow in line with demographic trends. The North American energy market was softer versus prior year as we experienced a few customer outages, which have since returned to normal run rates. Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. 
Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.
Asia is the fastest-growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth, but we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the start-up of our CNOOC project. 
The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed 2 new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets. 
The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. 
Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation. Also in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants, which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running, so we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3. 
As anticipated, the South American segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. 
Fiscal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.
The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24%, respectively. You may recall last quarter the ramp-up cost incurred to increase quota capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.
So in summary, I'd say we are firing on 4 out of 5 cylinders, as strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high quality business but we've also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on Slide 5. 
The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to 2 major areas: first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements; and second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. 
As you've seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are 6 remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long stop date.
In addition, Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. 
In parallel with antitrust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date. Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day 1 readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine, with the merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.
Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions. I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results."

Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year, volume was the largest contributor, with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project start-ups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way. 
Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past 6 quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches as well as coating to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.
Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe, and North America in both merchant and packaged. Sequentially, volume growth of 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. 
In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region. Currencies translation was flat year-over-year but negative 2% sequentially as major currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy, coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty, have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate will continue through the back half of the year. 
Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.
Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million, which was used to pay dividends and reduced net debt below $8 billion, the lowest level since 2012 prior to the new CO2 acquisition. 
Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up 2 large ASUs to serve CNOOC in China and winning 3 on-site projects, 2 in Asia and 1 in North America. Other total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance, the aerospace and manufacturing end markets. 
Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start up in 2019, but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.
As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018. With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook."

At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.
The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for the second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance, which quickly evaporated to 0%. 
Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4% as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. 
Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full year approached taken this January. Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to create a new, more valuable company. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

So we need to continue to do this, as you can imagine, to recover that inflation. Some of it contractual in our merchant packaged contract.

I would say, as you know, our South American business a little more than 3/4 would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more of just a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good but it's getting drowned out with some of the currency effects. Now within Brazil, clearly, the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying, what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly, we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals. As you're seeing more metals being produced, now part of that is for export. With the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally, but I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some sign. But it really until the election, it's going to be hard to see. As you may recall, in North America, when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back 4 years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then, over time, merchant and then packaged. In Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and packaged really turning the corner. Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies. But frankly, until the October election, it's going to be tough. I think we got to really have to see what happens in 2019. And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When AMLO was elected, there are obviously some views and concerns. But when he came out announced the kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell."

A lot of them are based on English law and things like that. So from that perspective, we feel good. The merchant and packaged has been tough for a while. I would say more than just the last 6 months, we had a period of stagflation there for a bit of time. And so from that perspective -- which is very small for us, by the way, the packaged and merchant. So Russia has not been easy for a while but the on-sites have been be very good, and anything related to, I think, exports of natural resources continues to be good. So we'll have to see.

We did resolve that. That actually became a sale of equipment when all the dust settles. So if you pull that one out, I'd say low 2s is probably the more normalized, where we peaked on that. The nice thing I like about this current cycle, to your point, it is a good cycle. And what we're seeing, and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers, is a nice rhythm of start-ups and replacements, start-ups and replacements. From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that's constantly churning. A growing backlog can be good but we need to make sure we're starting them up. So right now we're having large start-ups. As you know, we had a very large start-up in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects. And as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that's a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful. So we feel very good. To your point, it's gotten up to 1.2. When I look out the rest of the year and we kind of probability adjust, it's possible we could have a 2 handle on the backlog again.

We had laid out back on our strategy probably 4 years ago, that based on our backlog, we anticipated a 3% EPS. And we stuck with EPS because, as you know, each contract can be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported, but we said the 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out 3-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next 3 to 4 years based on this current backlog. Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that, but this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog, which is where we still are right now give or take. So I'd say yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next 3 to 4 years. And if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years. From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago, were for natural -- reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas-fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that. Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets anyone using higher-cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid. But more what I would say we're seeing displace that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction. By burning in a better environment, you can reduce that, and you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into, even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental. So I would say the original main drivers have shifted, but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency."

What we're probably seeing is mid-single-digit plus on gas and then we're still double-digit on hardgoods right now. And it's funny I asked the same question internally here, and the answer is it's still as pretty broad based. Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding, shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well, but we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets. Some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics. So it still is pretty broad-based, and packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories. So at this point, there's no one market I could point to that I would say is more strong or weaker than the other, but it's fairly broad based."

Brazil is still probably mid-70s and that's just as much a function that we still have some on-site customers under take or pay that we do over. So it's probably the base molecules are constricting even as much, if not more, than the liquefaction capacity there. When I look at Europe, we continue to see some improvements. We're getting up to, say, mid-70s now for LIN and LOX. Argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that -- it's a little tighter in some areas, but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand. That continues to be strong across several countries in Asia.

And as you can imagine, part of that pass-through is both power and fluorine and refrigerants and also some of that price. So it's a combination of packaged gas is in our refrigerant business in Southern Europe. But I would say that I don't know I could call it a leader, but I would say packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated with inflation. As you know, in packaged, the contracts are not very long. They could be 1, 2, 3 years or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster. And in some cases, especially hardgoods, where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hardgoods, these hardgoods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation. So you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hardgoods' higher costs. So it's a combination, I'd say, of all that. But -- so I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied, timing-wise, to inflation, given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hardgoods and gases."

As far as the ones we've won, chemicals and electronics primarily, as we have mentioned, when you looked at the U.S., still seeing strong chemicals activity across the spectrum, and so investments continue to be made and this was an asset related to that investment. And in Asia, one in chemicals and one in electronics. So as we had mentioned in prior calls these continue to be kind of the strongest growth end markets, primarily in Asia and North America, as you know, and we continue to see good opportunities.

As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that. So these are aspects that you could track to recover. And so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually 2, 3 months, but that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers, but this is not, I would say, anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy, especially in the United States, is going. When the economy is going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers. And when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general. So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we've had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned, of in-house drivers versus outsourced of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable. Clearly, they got to meet our safety standards and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it would take some time for us to get them to be the right drivers, but it's something we're used to. We got a great team that does this day in and day out.

So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for CO2. So we had the outages during the difficult time. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of our sources are back and running to normal rates, but we see a normal seasonal decline at this point just given the seasonality, but we feel we should be able to manage this now given the balance."

But it seems like industry utilization rates, in China in particular, somewhere in the 50% range.

You go back the last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in the -- what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity in the nonindustrial gas, meaning steel mills that have byproduct coming off of their captive plants. So this drove both -- not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand. And pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the year since had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid- to high single digits. The pricing, and you just look back at our history, was not reflected of that. So I would say at this point now, you had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity is especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills have been shuttered. Remains to be seen how much more of that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed but you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect. I mean because you got to remember, in China, it had some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that into consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, was one of our biggest inputs. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements."

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively.

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation. The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital, which is 150 basis points better than last year.
The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives including pricing cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continue to position ourselves for future growth by winning 3 new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts. 
Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends especially in North America and Asia, which are 2 of the best-performing regions. 
The North American segment had 52% of sales, has steadily improved several quarters in a row as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high single to double digits for both cylinder gases and our goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America has supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes. 
Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project start-ups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customer run rates improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continued to grow in line with demographic trends. The North American energy market was softer versus prior year as we experienced a few customer outages, which have since returned to normal run rates. Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. 
Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.
Asia is the fastest-growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth, but we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the start-up of our CNOOC project. 
The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed 2 new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets. 
The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. 
Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation. Also in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants, which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running, so we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3. 
As anticipated, the South American segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. 
Fiscal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.
The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24%, respectively. You may recall last quarter the ramp-up cost incurred to increase coater capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.
So in summary, I'd say we are firing on 4 out of 5 cylinders, as strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high quality business but we've also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on Slide 5. 
The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to 2 major areas: first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements; and second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. 
As you've seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are 6 remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long stop date.
In addition, Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. 
In parallel with antitrust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date. Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day 1 readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine, with the merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.
Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions. I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results."

Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year, volume was the largest contributor, with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project start-ups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way. 
Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past 6 quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches as well as coating to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.
Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe, and North America in both merchant and packaged. Sequentially, volume growth of 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. 
In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region. Currencies translation was flat year-over-year but negative 2% sequentially as major currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy, coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty, have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate will continue through the back half of the year. 
Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.
Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million, which was used to pay dividends and reduced net debt below $8 billion, the lowest level since 2012 prior to the NuCO2 acquisition. 
Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up 2 large ASUs to serve CNOOC in China and winning 3 on-site projects, 2 in Asia and 1 in North America. Other total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance, the aerospace and manufacturing end markets. 
Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start up in 2019, but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.
As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018. With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook."

At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.
The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for the second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance, which quickly evaporated to 0%. 
Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4% as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. 
Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full year approached taken this January. Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to create a new, more valuable company. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I would say, as you know, our South American business a little more than 3/4 would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more of just a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good but it's getting drowned out with some of the currency effects. Now within Brazil, clearly, the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying, what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly, we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals. As you're seeing more metals being produced, now part of that is for export. With the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally, but I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some sign. But it really until the election, it's going to be hard to see. As you may recall, in North America, when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back 4 years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then, over time, merchant and then packaged. In Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and packaged really turning the corner. Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies. But frankly, until the October election, it's going to be tough. I think we got to really have to see what happens in 2019. And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When AMLO was elected, there are obviously some views and concerns. But when he came out announced the kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell."

One thing you'd want to take into consideration on that, we had a large steam methane reformer project that was in there for quite some time, probably 7 or 8 years when you go back in time on that. We did resolve that. That actually became a sale of equipment when all the dust settles. So if you pull that one out, I'd say low 2s is probably the more normalized, where we peaked on that. The nice thing I like about this current cycle, to your point, it is a good cycle. And what we're seeing, and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers, is a nice rhythm of start-ups and replacements, start-ups and replacements. From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that's constantly churning. A growing backlog can be good but we need to make sure we're starting them up. So right now we're having large start-ups. As you know, we had a very large start-up in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects. And as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that's a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful. So we feel very good. To your point, it's gotten up to 1.2. When I look out the rest of the year and we kind of probability adjust, it's possible we could have a 2 handle on the backlog again. And so I think the backdrop is pretty strong, and we feel good about our prospects and where we are on some of these pre-backlog opportunities."

We had laid out back on our strategy probably 4 years ago, that based on our backlog, we anticipated a 3% EPS. And we stuck with EPS because, as you know, each contract can be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported, but we said the 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out 3-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next 3 to 4 years based on this current backlog. Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that, but this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog, which is where we still are right now give or take. So I'd say yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next 3 to 4 years. And if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years. From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago, were for natural -- reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas-fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that. Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets anyone using higher-cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid. But more what I would say we're seeing displace that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction. By burning in a better environment, you can reduce that, and you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into, even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental. So I would say the original main drivers have shifted, but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency."

Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding, shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well, but we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets. Some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics. So it still is pretty broad-based, and packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories. So at this point, there's no one market I could point to that I would say is more strong or weaker than the other, but it's fairly broad based."

Brazil is still probably mid-70s and that's just as much a function that we still have some on-site customers under take or pay that we do over. So it's probably the base molecules are constricting even as much, if not more, than the liquefaction capacity there. When I look at Europe, we continue to see some improvements. We're getting up to, say, mid-70s now for LIN and LOX. Argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that -- it's a little tighter in some areas, but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand. That continues to be strong across several countries in Asia. So I'd say trends are going well but we're able to get good utilization out of our asset base globally, but clearly, we have room to expand if needed in all of our markets."

So it's a combination of packaged gas is in our refrigerant business in Southern Europe. But I would say that I don't know I could call it a leader, but I would say packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated with inflation. As you know, in packaged, the contracts are not very long. They could be 1, 2, 3 years or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster. And in some cases, especially hardgoods, where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hardgoods, these hardgoods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation. So you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hardgoods' higher costs. So it's a combination, I'd say, of all that. But -- so I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied, timing-wise, to inflation, given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hardgoods and gases."

As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that. So these are aspects that you could track to recover. And so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually 2, 3 months, but that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers, but this is not, I would say, anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy, especially in the United States, is going. When the economy is going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers. And when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general. So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we've had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned, of in-house drivers versus outsourced of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable. Clearly, they got to meet our safety standards and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it would take some time for us to get them to be the right drivers, but it's something we're used to. We got a great team that does this day in and day out. And from my perspective, while it's challenging, while it's tough, there's nothing I've seen overly concerning about this current trend versus any prior trends."

The vast majority of our customers were back end running hard. Like you said, although this quarter, we did have 2 large customers that were having some outages, they are back running now. So that -- from that perspective I'd say right now, we're seeing pretty strong demand and strong volumes. And the refiners, from my perspective, want to run. And so hydrogen is doing well. So is oxygen and nitrogen, which both go to refineries as well. So at this stage, things are running well, and then we'll just have to see how things go forward."

So you could probably back into what that might have meant from a Europe perspective. And yes, when you look at that price of 3%, as you may recall, inflation's been challenging in Europe but we're starting to see some signs. There are some tightness of certain products and I think that is driving a little bit of the inflation as well. And so our team's done a good job to go out there and get back some of this pent-up inflation, and power has been a big area. You may recall when you look at pass-through with 4% this quarter, I think last quarter, we were similar number low single digits. So we've started to see power, as I'd say, the initial area of inflation and it's kind of creeping through in other areas. So our team needed to get ahead of it, and they did. So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for CO2. So we had the outages during the difficult time. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of our sources are back and running to normal rates, but we see a normal seasonal decline at this point just given the seasonality, but we feel we should be able to manage this now given the balance."

You go back the last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in the -- what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity in the nonindustrial gas, meaning steel mills that have byproduct coming off of their captive plants. So this drove both -- not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand. And pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the year since had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid- to high single digits. The pricing, and you just look back at our history, was not reflected of that. So I would say at this point now, you had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity is especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills have been shuttered. Remains to be seen how much more of that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed but you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect. I mean because you got to remember, in China, it had some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that into consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, was one of our biggest inputs. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements."

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively.

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation. The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital, which is 150 basis points better than last year.
The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives including price and cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continued to position ourselves for future growth by winning 3 new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts. 
Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends especially in North America and Asia, which are 2 of the best-performing regions. 
The North American segment had 52% of sales, has steadily improved several quarters in a row as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high single to double digits for both cylinder gases and hard goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America has supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes. 
Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project start-ups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customer run rates improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continued to grow in line with demographic trends. The North American energy market was softer versus prior year as we experienced a few customer outages, which have since returned to normal run rates. Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. 
Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities, especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.
Asia is the fastest-growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth, but we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the start-up of our CNOOC project. 
The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed 2 new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets. 
The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. 
Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation. Also in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants, which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running, so we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3. 
As anticipated, the South American segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. 
Fiscal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.
The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24%, respectively. You may recall last quarter the ramp-up cost incurred to increase coater  capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.
So in summary, I'd say we are firing on 4 out of 5 cylinders, as strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high quality business, but we've also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on Slide 5. 
The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to 2 major areas: first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements; and second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. 
As you've seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are 6 remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long stop date.
In addition, Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. 
In parallel with antitrust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date. Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day 1 readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine, with the merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.
Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions. I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results."

Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year, volume was the largest contributor, with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project start-ups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way. 
Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past 6 quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches as well as coating to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.
Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe, and North America in both merchant and packaged. Sequentially, volume growth of 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. 
In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region. Currencies translation was flat year-over-year but negative 2% sequentially as major currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy, coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty, have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate will continue through the back half of the year. 
Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.
Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million, which was used to pay dividends and reduce net debt below $8 billion, the lowest level since 2012 prior to the new CO2 acquisition. 
Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up 2 large ASUs to serve CNOOC in China and winning 3 on-site projects, 2 in Asia and 1 in North America. Of the total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance, the aerospace and manufacturing end markets. 
Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start up in 2019, but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.
As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018. With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook."

At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.
The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for this second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance, which quickly evaporated to 0%. 
Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4% as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. 
Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full year approach taken this January. Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to create a new, more valuable company. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I would say, as you know, our South American business a little more than 3/4 would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more just of a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good but it's getting drowned out with some of the currency effects. Now within Brazil, clearly, the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying, what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly, we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals as you're seeing more metals being produced. Now part of that is for export. With the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally, but I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some thawing. But it really, until the election, it's going to be hard to see. As you may recall, in North America, when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back 4 years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then, over time, merchant and then packaged. In Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and packaged really turning the corner. Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies. But frankly, until the October elections, it's going to be tough. I think we're got to really have to see what happens in 2019. And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When AMLO was elected, there were obviously some views and concerns. But when he came out announced kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell."

The nice thing I like about this current cycle, to your point, it is a good cycle. And what we're seeing, and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers, is a nice rhythm of start-ups and replacements, start-ups and replacements. From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that's constantly churning. A growing backlog can be good but we need to make sure we're starting them up. So right now we're having large start-ups. As you know, we had a very large start-up in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects. And as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that's a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful. So we feel very good.

We had laid out back on our strategy probably 4 years ago, that based on our backlog, we anticipated a 3% EPS. And we stuck with EPS because, as you know, each contract can be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported, but we said a 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out 3-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next 3 to 4 years based on this current backlog. Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that, but this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog, which is where we still are right now give or take. So I'd say yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next 3 to 4 years. And if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years. From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago, were for natural -- reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas-fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that. Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets anyone using higher-cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid. But more what I would say we're seeing displace that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction. By burning in a better environment, you can reduce that, and you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into, even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental. So I would say the original main drivers have shifted, but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency."

Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding, shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well, but we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets. Some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics. So it still is pretty broad-based, and packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories. So at this point, there's no one market I could point to that I would say is more strong or weaker than the other, but it's fairly broad based."

Brazil is still probably mid-70s and that's just as much a function of, we still have some on-site customers under take or pay that we do over. So it's probably the base molecules are constricting even as much, if not more, than the liquefaction capacity there. When I look at Europe, we continue to see some improvements. We're getting up to, say, mid-70s now for LIN and LOX. Argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that -- it's a little tighter in some areas, but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand. That continues to be strong across several countries in Asia.

And as you can imagine, part of that pass-through is both power and fluorine and refrigerants and also some of that price. So it's a combination of packaged gases in our refrigerant business in Southern Europe. But I would say that I don't know I could call it a leader, but I would say packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated with inflation. As you know, in packaged, the contracts are not very long. They could be 1, 2, 3 years or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster. And in some cases, especially hard goods, where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hard goods, these hard goods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation. So you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hard goods' higher costs. So it's a combination, I'd say, of all that. But -- so I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied, timing-wise, to inflation, given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hard goods and gases."

So I think the start-up next year we still believe will overall reach that 3% number in that range I talked about before for EPS growth, but the backlog reduction somewhere in that neighborhood of 1/3 or maybe a little less. As far as the ones we've won, chemicals and electronics primarily, as we had mentioned, when you look at the U.S., still seeing strong chemicals activity across the spectrum, and so investments continue to be made and this was an asset related to that investment. And in Asia, one in chemicals and one in electronics. So as we had mentioned in prior calls these continue to be kind of the strongest growth end markets, primarily in Asia and North America, as you know, and we continue to see good opportunities. And if I look at our pre-backlog, the major 3 markets related to that are still electronics, chemicals and energy, to an extent. Those are, right now, I would say, probably in the best build cycle. But hopefully, we'll start seeing things in manufacturing and some of the other end markets soon."

As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that. So these are aspects that you contract to recover. And so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually 2, 3 months, but that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers, but this is not, I would say, anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy, especially in the United States, is going. When the economy is going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers. And when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general. So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we've had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned, of in-house drivers versus outsourced of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable. Clearly, they've got to meet our safety standards and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it takes some time for us to get them to be the right drivers, but it's something we're used to. We've got a great team that does this day in, day out. And from my perspective, while it's challenging, while it's tough, there's nothing I've seen overly concerning about this current trend versus any prior trends."

And yes, when you look at that price of 3%, as you may recall, inflation's been challenging in Europe but we're starting to see some signs. There are some tightness of certain products and I think that is driving a little bit of the inflation as well. And so our team's done a good job to go out there and get back some of this pent-up inflation, and power has been a big area. You may recall when you look at pass-through, we had 4% this quarter, I think last quarter, we were a similar number, low single digits. So we've started to see power, as I'd say, the initial area of inflation and it's kind of creeping through in other areas. So our team needed to get ahead of it, and they did. So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for CO2. So we had the outages during the difficult time. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of our sources are back and running to normal rates, but we see a normal seasonal decline at this point just given the seasonality, but we feel we should be able to manage this now given the balance."

You go back the last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in the -- what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity in the nonindustrial gas, meaning steel mills that had byproduct coming off of their captive plants. So this drove both -- not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand. And pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the years has had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid- to high single digits. The pricing, and you just look back at our history, was not reflected of that. So I would say at this point now, you've had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity, especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills have been shuttered. Remains to be seen how much more of that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed but you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect. I mean because you got to remember, in China, it has some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that in consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, is one of our biggest inputs. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements."

The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increase",1216,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. The strong momentum continued into the second quarter as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation. The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital, which is 150 basis points better than last year.
The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives including price and cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continued to position ourselves for future growth by winning 3 new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts. 
Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends especially in North America and Asia, which are 2 of the best-performing regions. 
The North American segment had 52% of sales, has steadily improved several quarters in a row as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high single to double digits for both cylinder gases and hard goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America has supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes. 
Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project start-ups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customer run rates improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continued to grow in line with demographic trends. The North American energy market was softer versus prior year as we experienced a few customer outages, which have since returned to normal run rates. Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. 
Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities, especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.
Asia is the fastest-growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth, but we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the start-up of our CNOOC project. 
The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed 2 new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets. 
The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. 
Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation. Also in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants, which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running, so we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3. 
As anticipated, the South American segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. 
Fiscal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.
The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24%, respectively. You may recall last quarter the ramp-up cost incurred to increase coater capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.
So in summary, I'd say we are firing on 4 out of 5 cylinders, as strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high quality business, but we've also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on Slide 5. 
The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to 2 major areas: first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements; and second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. 
As you've seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are 6 remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long stop date.
In addition, Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. 
In parallel with antitrust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date. Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day 1 readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine, with the merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.
Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions. I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results."

Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year, volume was the largest contributor, with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project start-ups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way. 
Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past 6 quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches as well as coating to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.
Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe, and North America in both merchant and packaged. Sequentially, volume growth of 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. 
In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region. Currencies translation was flat year-over-year but negative 2% sequentially as major currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy, coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty, have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate will continue through the back half of the year. 
Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.
Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million, which was used to pay dividends and reduce net debt below $8 billion, the lowest level since 2012 prior to the NuCO2 acquisition. 
Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up 2 large ASUs to serve CNOOC in China and winning 3 on-site projects, 2 in Asia and 1 in North America. Of the total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance, the aerospace and manufacturing end markets. 
Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start up in 2019, but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.
As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018. With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook."

At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.
The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for this second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance, which quickly evaporated to 0%. 
Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4% as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. 
Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full year approach taken this January. Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to create a new, more valuable company. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I would say, as you know, our South American business a little more than 3/4 would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more just of a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good but it's getting drowned out with some of the currency effects. Now within Brazil, clearly, the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying, what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly, we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals as you're seeing more metals being produced. Now part of that is for export. With the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally, but I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some thawing. But it really, until the election, it's going to be hard to see. As you may recall, in North America, when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back 4 years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then, over time, merchant and then packaged. In Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and packaged really turning the corner. Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies. But frankly, until the October elections, it's going to be tough. I think we're got to really have to see what happens in 2019. And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When AMLO was elected, there were obviously some views and concerns. But when he came out announced kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell."

I would say more than just the last 6 months, we had a period of stagflation there for a bit of time. And so from that perspective -- which is very small for us, by the way, the packaged and merchant.

The nice thing I like about this current cycle, to your point, it is a good cycle. And what we're seeing, and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers, is a nice rhythm of start-ups and replacements, start-ups and replacements. From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that's constantly churning. A growing backlog can be good but we need to make sure we're starting them up. So right now we're having large start-ups. As you know, we had a very large start-up in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects. And as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that's a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful. So we feel very good. To your point, it's gotten up to 1.2. When I look out the rest of the year and we kind of probability adjust, it's possible we could have a 2 handle on the backlog again.

We had laid out back on our strategy probably 4 years ago, that based on our backlog, we anticipated a 3% EPS. And we stuck with EPS because, as you know, each contract can be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported, but we said a 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out 3-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next 3 to 4 years based on this current backlog. Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that, but this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog, which is where we still are right now give or take. So I'd say yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next 3 to 4 years. And if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years. From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago, were for natural -- reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas-fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that. Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets anyone using higher-cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid. But more what I would say we're seeing displace that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction. By burning in a better environment, you can reduce that, and you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into, even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental. So I would say the original main drivers have shifted, but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency."

Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding, shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well, but we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets. Some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics. So it still is pretty broad-based, and packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories.

Brazil is still probably mid-70s and that's just as much a function of, we still have some on-site customers under take or pay that we do over. So it's probably the base molecules are constricting even as much, if not more, than the liquefaction capacity there. When I look at Europe, we continue to see some improvements. We're getting up to, say, mid-70s now for LIN and LOX. Argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that -- it's a little tighter in some areas, but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand. That continues to be strong across several countries in Asia. So I'd say trends are going well but we're able to get good utilization out of our asset base globally, but clearly, we have room to expand if needed in all of our markets."

And as you can imagine, part of that pass-through is both power and fluorine and refrigerants and also some of that price. So it's a combination of packaged gases in our refrigerant business in Southern Europe. But I would say that I don't know I could call it a leader, but I would say packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated with inflation. As you know, in packaged, the contracts are not very long. They could be 1, 2, 3 years or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster. And in some cases, especially hard goods, where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hard goods, these hard goods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation. So you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hard goods' higher costs. So it's a combination, I'd say, of all that. But -- so I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied, timing-wise, to inflation, given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hard goods and gases."

Could be a little bit lower because, as you know, this year, we had a couple of large start-ups including our largest project ever. So I think the start-up next year we still believe will overall reach that 3% number in that range I talked about before for EPS growth, but the backlog reduction somewhere in that neighborhood of 1/3 or maybe a little less. As far as the ones we've won, chemicals and electronics primarily, as we had mentioned, when you look at the U.S., still seeing strong chemicals activity across the spectrum, and so investments continue to be made and this was an asset related to that investment. And in Asia, one in chemicals and one in electronics. So as we had mentioned in prior calls these continue to be kind of the strongest growth end markets, primarily in Asia and North America, as you know, and we continue to see good opportunities. And if I look at our pre-backlog, the major 3 markets related to that are still electronics, chemicals and energy, to an extent. Those are, right now, I would say, probably in the best build cycle. But hopefully, we'll start seeing things in manufacturing and some of the other end markets soon."

As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that. So these are aspects that you contract to recover. And so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually 2, 3 months, but that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers, but this is not, I would say, anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy, especially in the United States, is going. When the economy is going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers. And when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general. So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we've had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned, of in-house drivers versus outsourced of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable. Clearly, they've got to meet our safety standards and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it takes some time for us to get them to be the right drivers, but it's something we're used to. We've got a great team that does this day in, day out. And from my perspective, while it's challenging, while it's tough, there's nothing I've seen overly concerning about this current trend versus any prior trends."

There are some tightness of certain products and I think that is driving a little bit of the inflation as well. And so our team's done a good job to go out there and get back some of this pent-up inflation, and power has been a big area. You may recall when you look at pass-through, we had 4% this quarter, I think last quarter, we were a similar number, low single digits. So we've started to see power, as I'd say, the initial area of inflation and it's kind of creeping through in other areas. So our team needed to get ahead of it, and they did. So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for CO2. So we had the outages during the difficult time.

You go back the last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in the -- what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity in the nonindustrial gas, meaning steel mills that had byproduct coming off of their captive plants. So this drove both -- not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand. And pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the years has had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid- to high single digits. The pricing, and you just look back at our history, was not reflected of that. So I would say at this point now, you've had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity, especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills have been shuttered. Remains to be seen how much more of that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed but you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect. I mean because you got to remember, in China, it has some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that in consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, is one of our biggest inputs. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements."
