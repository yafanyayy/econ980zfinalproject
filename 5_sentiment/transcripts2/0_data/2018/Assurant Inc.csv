Specifically, for ful",1340,"Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. We delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders while also building a stronger Assurant for the future. Specifically, for full year 2017, we generated net operating income growth of 9%, excluding reportable catastrophes, well ahead of our initial expectations, business growth and $12.5 million of net onetime benefits. Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew by 22%, surpassing our long-term average annual target of 15%. And we completed the return of $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders as planned.
In 2017, we also achieved key milestones in our multiyear transformation, which we believe position our company for continued profitable growth. We invested in our digital and data analytics areas, and we also established capability centers for enterprise strategic account management, customer experience, robotics and artificial intelligence. These are just a few examples of investments to strengthen our competitive advantage. Through our newly formed enterprise procurement group and other initiatives, we've made good progress towards our $100 million gross expense savings target. These savings, largely sourced from third-party sending, have and will fund ongoing investments in the business while expanding margins over time.
We've also continued to manage capital prudently with a goal of enhancing shareholder value. Not only do we complete our return of $1.5 billion to shareholders, we also announced our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We believe this transaction positions us as a leading lifestyle provider with significant synergies, platform for continued innovation and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.
In January, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we amended the transaction agreement to simplify the overall structure and optimize the financing plan. Importantly, tax reform provides meaningful savings through our operations, which will benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.
Let me now share some of the highlights for the year for each of our operating segments. Global Lifestyle's earnings grew 15% for the full year, ahead of our average annual growth target of 10%. As we advanced our position as a strong lifestyle competitor with an attractive product and client mix. In Connected Living, we had a new partnerships of leading global brands such as Comcast, Apple and most recently with KDDI in Japan. We now protect over 36 million covered devices worldwide, with a growing portion of those devices leveraging our premium tech support capabilities. Our vehicle protection business remained a strong performer in 2017, with nearly 10% revenue growth, operating ROE in the mid-teens and solid cash flow. Our results reflect continued volume growth in third-party administrators as well as our partnerships with leading OEMs. Our acquisition of The Warranty Group will expand our reach into the complementary channels such networks and national accounts, which will strengthen our overall position in the vehicle protection market. 
In Global Housing, 2017 was marked by significant weather-related activities across the Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S., which resulted in $190 million of after-tax net reportable catastrophe losses. Despite the significant devastation, our comprehensive reinsurance program provided broad multi-storm coverage to mitigate losses. Unfortunately during this time, our employees responded exceptionally well for these events, providing support to those in need. 
Looking at our underlying performance, excluding reportable catastrophes, Global Housing net operating income was roughly level with 2016. This was better-than-expected, driven by strong fourth quarter results within our lender-placed insurance and flood businesses. We made progress driving our operational excellence initiatives to mitigate declines in lender-placed. 
In 2017, we ran pilots to migrate clients onto our single processing platform, which will provide a more seamless customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies over time. So far, results are encouraging. Those savings from these efforts will not be realized until later this year and beyond. Lender-placed remains an important business for us and all of this work will help us continue to be an innovative leader and maintain strong returns long term.
In multi-family housing, we now protect over 1.8 million renters across the U.S., an increase of almost 20% from 2016. This reflects our strong suite of products and superior customer experience. In addition to working through our property management and affinity partners, we continue to innovate and now offer products through new digital channels with partnerships with companies like Tenant Cloud, Cozy and Sure. Strong growth within multi-family housing help offset declines in mortgage solutions where we continue to see weak market demand in new loan origination and field services. 
During 2017, we took actions to realize efficiencies in our mortgage solutions operations, including assessing our real estate footprint and operating platform. We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018, and we'll further adjust costs as needed. 
Moving to Global Preneed. With $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders as well as expanded product offering for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1.9 million customers across North America.
As we look at 2018 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our scale and expertise in both the lifestyle and housing markets to continue driving profitable growth. Across our businesses, we will look to enhance our customer focuses with an emphasis on strategic account management to deepen our client relationships and continuously improve the customer experience. 
Sustaining innovation through investments in artificial intelligence in areas like the connected car, connected home will be important. This will be balanced by a steadfast focus on operational excellence as we continue to strengthen our technology foundation, drive margin expansion and live our Assurant operating model. We believe our talent remains a competitive advantage. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our people and further champion a culture of engagement, growth and performance as we build a stronger Assurant for the future. Our long-term commitment remains to grow earnings over time, and we're pleased that already in 2017, we have seen success with the results of our transformation.
Based on our current plans for 2018, we expect Assurant net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, to be up 10% to 14% from the $412 million reported in 2017. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by a lower consolidated effective tax rate and modest growth in underlying earnings, recognizing that includes $12.5 million of net onetime benefits, which are not expected to recur. As we announced previously, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to about 22% to 23% from 33% historically. While a significant portion of the tax savings will drive higher earnings, we currently plan to reinvest approximately 1/3 of those tax savings to support future growth across the enterprise. We will provide more details as plans were finalized by the second quarter of 2018.
Looking at underlying earnings, profitable growth is expected to be driven primarily by mobile in Connected Living, our multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses. We anticipate some additional declines in lender-placed in credit insurance, which will offset much of that growth. Expense savings from enterprise initiatives are also expected to continue. Operating earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, are expected to grow more than net operating income, drive by share repurchase activity during the past year. 
Our current outlook for 2018 does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing plan. We'll update our outlook for the year when appropriate. 
In addition, we will refresh our long-term metrics and targets to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations. As we've stated previously, we are confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long-term and our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,549709261,1385348,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2018",2018-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower",1730,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower reportable catastrophes, the absence of $20 million of lender-placed regulatory expenses and more income from processing a substantially higher volume of claims under the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, following Hurricane Harvey. We've now closed more than 90% of our NFIP flood claims, so we do not explain this income to continue into 2018. 
In addition, fourth quarter 2017 results also reflected more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. In the first half of 2018, however, we expect non-catastrophe losses to increase to more normalized levels as well as reflecting typical winter and spring seasonality. Growth in multi-family housing and the new lender-placed loans on boarded earlier this year also contributed to a strong fourth quarter. We will continue to see declines in the lender-placed portfolio in 2018 but at a slower pace.
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined portfolio or the lender-placed and manufacturing housing businesses decreased to 75.2% from 105% in the prior year period. Net reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $3.2 million pretax, a $62 million year-over-year decrease. Fourth quarter 2017 losses were mainly related to California wildfires and were partially offset by a reduction in reinstatement premiums as claims for the third quarter hurricanes developed more favorably than initially expected. As a reminder, Hurricane Matthew occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in elevated claims. Excluding catastrophe losses, the risk-based combined ratio was 74.1%, down from 88.8% in the prior year period. This improvement reflects the absence of regulatory expenses, higher-than-expected NFIP income and better than average non-catastrophe loss experience. The pretax margin for the fee-based capital-light offerings was down 60 basis points to 10.6% as declines in mortgage solutions were partially offset by profitable growth in multi-family housing. Evaluation field services continued to experience lower client volumes and impacted by market conditions. 
Turning to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. Lower placement rates and lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions drove the decrease. Specifically, the placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the third quarter. This reflects both the overall improvement in the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. The overall reduction of Global Housing revenue was partially offset by policy growth, mainly from affinity partners and multi-family housing and premiums from new lender-placed loans on boarded earlier in 2017. We do not expect additional revenue growth from these loans in 2018. As evidenced last year, our Catastrophe Reinsurance Program is a critical component of managing our risk. In January, we placed around 65% of our 2018 program within the traditional reinsurance market. Rates were in line with the broader market, up 5% to 10% on blended basis. We were also able to add another multiyear layer of protection and maintained certain key features like cascading in the event of multiple storms. As we do every year, we expect to complete and announce our program in July.
For full year 2018, we expect Global Housing's underlying earnings to decline from 2017 before taking into account savings from tax reform. After reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20%, with some of the savings we invested in the business, we expect earnings to increase. 
2018 should mark the last year of significant lender-placed declines with an expected 4 to 5 basis point quarterly reduction in the placement rate. The rollout of our new single sourced processing platform is expected to drive additional efficiencies. However, not until the end of '18 and more substantially thereafter. Giving this deployment schedule, our risk-based expense ratio will remain elevated through 2018.
Our multi-family housing business is expected to generate continued profitable growth, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased product relations. With regard to mortgage solutions, market conditions are still expected to be challenging. We are working hard to improve mortgage solutions results and will continue to drive operating efficiencies to mitigate some of the market weakness. In terms of revenue, we expect Global Housing to be roughly flat in 2018, as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Moving to Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $43 million for the fourth quarter, up $8 million year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs, more favorable loss experience and a client recoverable of $5 million. We also saw continued growth from the vehicle protection business. Results were partially offset by declines from credit insurance as well as lower income from mobile repair and logistics due to lighter trading activity. We no longer expect to see an increase in trading volumes in the first quarter of 2018 as sales of new smartphones have been lower than the industry originally forecasted.
Turning to revenue. Net earning premiums and fees were up $74 million or 9% in the quarter. This excludes a program structure change made at the end of 2016 for a large service contract client. Growth was mainly from increased mobile subscribers, including newly launched programs, which are performing well. Vehicle protection was also a key driver. Results were partially offset by lower mobile trade and activity as noted earlier. 
Looking at the segments profitability metrics, the combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased in the quarter to 96.3%, up approximately 70 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The pretax margin for fee-based capital-light businesses was 5.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the prior period. The drivers for both metrics aligned with our net operating income commentary for the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with our overall 2017 results with Global Lifestyle earnings up 15%, including some onetime benefits. So while we expect Global Lifestyle's underlying earnings to increase in 2018, the increase is anticipated to be more modest. This is all before considering savings from tax reform. We expect earnings growth in mobile, including programs implemented during 2017. Mobile trade and activity will depend on the success of new phone introductions, availability of these phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. Around 2018, we also anticipate continued profitable growth in our vehicle protection business, as strong sales from prior periods begin to earn. Credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% and some reinvestments to support growth, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be up more substantially in 2018.
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. [indiscernible] Fourth quarter net operating income a decrease of $6.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to a $5 million software asset write-down. Revenue in preneed was up 9%, driven mainly by growth in Canada and sales of our final need product in the U.S. and strong sales in prior periods. Days sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower final need sales and seasonality. Sales in this segment, overall, tend to be lower in the fourth quarter, leading up to the holidays.
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. We're actively monitoring the impact of this particularly harsh flu season as it may result in more elevated mortality in the first quarter. Preneed results were also reflect a lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% with a portion of savings reinvested in the business. At corporate, the net operating loss was $29 million, an increase of $9 million. This was due to lower investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For 2018, we expect full corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account a lower tax rate of 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.
Turning to capital. We ended the year with $540 million of total company capital or about $290 million of deployable capital adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, lifestyle and preneed to the holding company, totaled $108 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total dividends for the year to $229 million. This was lower than segment earnings, mostly due to a statutory deferred tax asset write down of $95 million in the fourth quarter, following the enactment of tax reform.
In addition, $21 million of dividends were distributed from Assurant Health and employee benefit as we continue to release residual capital associated with these businesses. We have now distributed nearly all the capital that had previously supported these businesses, and therefore, do not anticipate any material additional dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased $139 million of shares and paid $30 million in shareholder dividends. We now have completed the $1.5 billion return of capital since 2016 at an average share price of $87.09. In 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be at least equal to segment operating earnings. This is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the impact of tax reform. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, including setting aside bonds to complete our EK investment and support The Warranty Group integration. As always, share buyback activity will be subject to market conditions and our overall financing plan for The Warranty Group. We're also hard at work on integration planning and our efforts are on track, with an expected close in the second quarter of 2018. Last week, we reviewed The Warranty Group's preliminary results for the full year. While their close process is not yet completed, results for the year finished strong and in line with our expectations. As Alan noted earlier, we plan to update our outlook as needed to reflect the Warranty Group acquisition and related financing plan. In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017, which provide a solid foundation to provide profitable growth in 2018, and we remain excited about our future prospects. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders while also building a stronger Assurant for the future. Specifically, for full year 2017, we generated net operating income growth of 9%, excluding reportable catastrophes, well ahead of our initial expectations to the business growth, and $12.5 million of net one-time benefits.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew by 22%, surpassing our long-term average annual target of 15%. And we completed the return of $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders, as planned.
In 2017, we also achieved key milestones in our multiyear transformation, which we believe position our company for continued profitable growth. We invested in our digital and data analytics areas, and we also established capability centers for enterprise strategic account management, customer experience, robotics and artificial intelligence. These are just a few examples of investments to strengthen our competitive advantage. 
Through our newly formed enterprise procurement group and other initiatives, we've made good progress toward our $100 million gross expense savings target. These savings, largely sourced from third-party spending, have and will fund ongoing investments in the business while expanding margins over time.
We've also continued to manage capital prudently with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Not only did we complete our return of $1.5 billion to shareholders, we also announced our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We believe this transaction positions us as a leading lifestyle provider with significant synergies, a platform for continued innovation and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.
In January, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we amended the transaction agreement to simplify the overall structure and optimize the financing plan. Importantly, tax reform provides meaningful savings to our operations, which will benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.
Let me now share some of the highlights from the year for each of our operating segments. Global Lifestyle's earnings grew 15% for the full year, ahead of our average annual growth target of 10%, as we advanced our position as a strong lifestyle competitor with an attractive product and client mix.
In Connected Living, we added new partnerships of leading global brands, such as Comcast, Apple and most recently with KDDI in Japan. We now protect over 36 million covered devices worldwide, with a growing portion of those devices leveraging our premium tech support capabilities.
Our vehicle protection business remained a strong performer in 2017 with nearly 10% revenue growth, operating ROE in the mid-teens and solid cash flow. Our results reflected continued volume growth in third-party administrators as well as our partnerships with leading OEMs.
Our acquisition of The Warranty Group will expand our reach into complementary channels such as dealer networks and national accounts, which will strengthen our overall position in the vehicle protection market. 
In Global Housing, 2017 was marked by significant weather-related activity across the Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S., which resulted in $190 million of after-tax net reportable catastrophe losses. Despite the significant devastation, our comprehensive reinsurance program provided broad multi-storm coverage to mitigate losses. And fortunately, during this time, our employees responded exceptionally well for these events, providing support to those in need. 
Looking at our underlying performance, excluding reportable catastrophes, Global Housing net operating income was roughly level with 2016. This was better than expected, driven by strong fourth quarter results within our lender-placed insurance and flood businesses. We made progress driving our operational excellence initiatives to mitigate declines in lender-placed. 
In 2017, we ran pilots to migrate clients onto our single processing platform, which will provide a more seamless customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies over time. So far, results are encouraging. Those savings from these efforts will not be realized until later this year and beyond. Lender-placed remains an important business for us, and all of this work will help us continue to be an innovative leader and maintain strong returns long term.
In multi-family housing, we now protect 1.8 million renters across the U.S., an increase of almost 20% from 2016. This reflects our strong suite of products and superior customer experience. In addition to working through our property management and affinity partners, we continue to innovate and now offer products through new digital channels with partnerships with companies like TenantCloud, Cozy and Sure. 
Strong growth within multi-family housing helped offset declines in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see weak market demand in new loan origination and field services. 
During 2017, we took actions to realize efficiencies in our mortgage solutions operations, including assessing our real estate footprint and operating platform. We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018, and we'll further adjust costs as needed.
Moving to Global Preneed. With $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders as well as expanded product offering for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1.9 million customers across North America.
As we look at 2018 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our scale and expertise in both the lifestyle and housing markets to continue driving profitable growth. Across our businesses, we will look to enhance our customer focuses with an emphasis on strategic account management to deepen our client relationships and continuously improve the customer experience. 
Sustaining innovation through investments in artificial intelligence in areas like the connected car, connected home, will be important. This will be balanced by a steadfast focus on operational excellence as we continue to strengthen our technology foundation, drive margin expansion and live our Assurant operating model.
We believe our talent remains a competitive advantage. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our people and further champion a culture of engagement, growth and performance as we build a stronger Assurant for the future. Our long-term commitment remains to grow earnings over time, and we're pleased that already in 2017, we have seen successful results from our transformation.
Based on our current plans for 2018, we expect Assurant net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, to be up 10% to 14% from the $412 million reported in 2017. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by a lower consolidated effective tax rate and modest growth in underlying earnings, recognizing that includes $12.5 million of net one-time benefits, which are not expected to recur.
As we announced previously, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to about 22% to 23% from 33% historically. While a significant portion of the tax savings will drive higher earnings, we currently plan to reinvest approximately 1/3 of those tax savings to support future growth across our enterprise. We will provide more details as plans are finalized by the second quarter of 2018.
Looking at underlying earnings, profitable growth is expected to be driven primarily by mobile in Connected Living, our multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses. We anticipate some additional declines in lender-placed in credit insurance, which will offset much of that growth. Expense savings from enterprise initiatives are also expected to continue. 
Operating earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, are expected to grow more than net operating income, driven by share repurchase activity during the past year. Our current outlook for 2018 does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing plan. We'll update our outlook for the year when appropriate. 
In addition, we will refresh our long-term metrics and targets to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations. As we've stated previously, we are confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long term and that our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,549709261,1385453,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2018",2018-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations.

Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower reportable catastrophes, the absence of $20 million of lender-placed regulatory expenses and more income from processing a substantially higher volume of claims under the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, following Hurricane Harvey. We've now closed more than 90% of our NFIP flood claims, so we do not expect this level of income to continue into 2018. 
In addition, fourth quarter 2017 results also reflected more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. In the first half of 2018, however, we expect non-catastrophe losses to increase to more normalized levels as well as reflecting typical winter and spring seasonality. Growth in multi-family housing and the new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier this year also contributed to a strong fourth quarter. We will continue to see declines in the lender-placed portfolio in 2018, but at a slower pace.
Looking at our key metrics. The risk-based combined portfolio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses decreased to 75.2% from 105% in the prior year period. Net reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $3.2 million pretax, a $62 million year-over-year decrease. Fourth quarter 2017 losses were mainly related to California wildfires and were partially offset by a reduction in reinstatement premiums as claims for the third quarter hurricanes developed more favorably than initially expected. As a reminder, Hurricane Matthew occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in elevated claims.
Excluding catastrophe losses, the risk-based combined ratio was 74.1%, down from 88.8% in the prior year period. This improvement reflects the absence of regulatory expenses, higher-than-expected NFIP income and better-than-average non-catastrophe loss experience. The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings was down 60 basis points to 10.6% as declines in mortgage solutions were partially offset by profitable growth in multi-family housing. Valuation and field services continue to experience lower client volumes and be impacted by market conditions. 
Turning to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. Lower placement rates in lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions drove the decrease. Specifically, the placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the third quarter. This reflects both the overall improvement in the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans.
The overall reduction in Global Housing revenue was partially offset by policy growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing and premiums from new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier in 2017. We do not expect additional revenue growth from these loans in 2018.
As evidenced last year, our Catastrophe Reinsurance Program is a critical component of managing our risk. In January, we placed around 65% of our 2018 program within the traditional reinsurance market. Rates were in line with the broader market, up 5% to 10% on a blended basis. We were also able to add another multiyear layer of protection and maintained certain key features like cascading in the event of multiple storms. As we do every year, we expect to complete and announce our program in July.
For full year 2018, we expect Global Housing's underlying earnings to decline from 2017 before taking into account savings from tax reform. After reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20%, with some of the savings reinvested in the business, we expect earnings to increase. 
2018 should mark the last year of significant lender-placed declines with an expected 4 to 5 basis point quarterly reduction in the placement rate. The rollout of our new single-source processing platform is expected to drive additional efficiencies, however, not until the end of '18 and more substantially thereafter. Given this deployment schedule, our risk-based expense ratio will remain elevated through 2018.
Our multi-family housing business is expected to generate continued profitable growth, driven by the expansion of our affinity property -- affinity and property management relationships as well as increased product penetration.
With regard to mortgage solutions, market conditions are still expected to be challenging. We are working hard to improve mortgage solutions' results, and we'll continue to drive operating efficiencies to mitigate some of the market weakness. In terms of revenue, we expect Global Housing to be roughly flat in 2018 as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Moving to Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $43 million for the fourth quarter, up $8 million year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs, more favorable loss experience and a client recoverable of $5 million. We also saw continued growth from the vehicle protection business. Results were partially offset by declines from credit insurance as well as lower income from mobile repair and logistics due to lighter trading activity. We no longer expect to see an increase in trading volumes in the first quarter of 2018 as sales of new smartphones have been lower than the industry originally forecasted.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $74 million or 9% in the quarter. This excludes a program structure change made at the end of 2016 for a large service contract client. Growth was mainly from increased mobile subscribers, including newly launched programs which are performing well. Vehicle protection was also a key driver. Results were partially offset by lower mobile trade-in activity, as noted earlier. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics. The combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased in the quarter to 96.3%, up approximately 70 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the prior period. The drivers for both metrics aligned with the net operating income commentary for the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with our overall 2017 results, with Global Lifestyle earnings up 15%, including some one-time benefits. So while we expect Global Lifestyle's underlying earnings to increase in 2018, the increase is anticipated to be more modest. This is all before considering savings from tax reform.
We expect earnings growth in mobile, including programs implemented during 2017. Mobile trade-in activity will depend on the success of new phone introductions, availability of these phones and mobile carrier promotional activity.
From 2018, we also anticipate continued profitable growth in our vehicle protection business as strong sales from prior periods begin to earn. Credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% and some reinvestments to support growth, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be up more substantially in 2018.
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $4.6 million in fourth quarter net operating income, a decrease of $6.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to a $5 million software asset write-down. Revenue in Preneed was up 9%, driven mainly by growth in Canada and sales of our final need product in the U.S. from the strong sales in prior periods. Base sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower final need sales and seasonality. Sales in this segment overall tend to be lower in the fourth quarter, leading up to the holidays. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients in adjacent product offerings. We're actively monitoring the impact of this particularly harsh flu season as it may result in more elevated mortality in the first quarter. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested in the business.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $29 million, an increase of $9 million. This was due to lower investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For 2018, we expect full corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account a lower tax rate of 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.
Turning to capital. We ended the year with $540 million of total company capital or about $290 million of deployable capital adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed to the holding company totaled $108 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total dividends for the year to $229 million. This was lower than segment earnings, mostly due to a statutory deferred tax asset write-down of $95 million in the fourth quarter, following the enactment of tax reform.
In addition, $21 million of dividends were distributed from Assurant Health and Employee Benefits as we continue to release residual capital associated with these businesses. We have now distributed nearly all the capital that had previously supported these businesses and, therefore, do not anticipate any material additional dividends.
During the quarter, we also repurchased $139 million of shares and paid $30 million in shareholder dividends. We now have completed the $1.5 billion return of capital since 2016 at an average share price of $87.09.
In 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be at least equal to segment operating earnings. This is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the impact of tax reform. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, including setting aside bonds to complete our Iké investment and support The Warranty Group integration. And as always, share buyback activity will be subject to market conditions and our overall financing plan for The Warranty Group. 
We're also hard at work on integration planning, and our efforts are on track, with an expected close in the second quarter of 2018. Last week, we reviewed The Warranty Group's preliminary results for the full year. While their close process is not yet completed, results for the year finished strong and in line with our expectations. As Alan noted earlier, we plan to update our outlook, as needed, to reflect The Warranty Group acquisition and related financing plan.
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017, which provide a solid foundation to provide profitable growth in 2018, and we remain excited about our future prospects.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

As Alan said in the remarks, we will -- we do envisage reinvesting about 1/3 of that back into the business."

We delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders while also building a stronger Assurant for the future. Specifically, for full year 2017, we generated net operating income growth of 9%, excluding reportable catastrophes, well ahead of our initial expectations to the business growth, and $12.5 million of net one-time benefits.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew by 22%, surpassing our long-term average annual target of 15%. And we completed the return of $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders, as planned.
In 2017, we also achieved key milestones in our multiyear transformation, which we believe position our company for continued profitable growth. We invested in our digital and data analytics areas, and we also established capability centers for enterprise strategic account management, customer experience, robotics and artificial intelligence. These are just a few examples of investments to strengthen our competitive advantage. 
Through our newly formed enterprise procurement group and other initiatives, we've made good progress toward our $100 million gross expense savings target. These savings, largely sourced from third-party spending, have and will fund ongoing investments in the business while expanding margins over time.
We've also continued to manage capital prudently with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Not only did we complete our return of $1.5 billion to shareholders, we also announced our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We believe this transaction positions us as a leading lifestyle provider with significant synergies, a platform for continued innovation and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.
In January, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we amended the transaction agreement to simplify the overall structure and optimize the financing plan. Importantly, tax reform provides meaningful savings to our operations, which will benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.
Let me now share some of the highlights from the year for each of our operating segments. Global Lifestyle's earnings grew 15% for the full year, ahead of our average annual growth target of 10%, as we advanced our position as a strong lifestyle competitor with an attractive product and client mix.
In Connected Living, we added new partnerships of leading global brands, such as Comcast, Apple and most recently with KDDI in Japan. We now protect over 36 million covered devices worldwide, with a growing portion of those devices leveraging our premium tech support capabilities.
Our vehicle protection business remained a strong performer in 2017 with nearly 10% revenue growth, operating ROE in the mid-teens and solid cash flow. Our results reflected continued volume growth in third-party administrators as well as our partnerships with leading OEMs.
Our acquisition of The Warranty Group will expand our reach into complementary channels such as dealer networks and national accounts, which will strengthen our overall position in the vehicle protection market. 
In Global Housing, 2017 was marked by significant weather-related activity across the Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S., which resulted in $190 million of after-tax net reportable catastrophe losses. Despite the significant devastation, our comprehensive reinsurance program provided broad multi-storm coverage to mitigate losses. And fortunately, during this time, our employees responded exceptionally well to these events, providing support to those in need. 
Looking at our underlying performance, excluding reportable catastrophes, Global Housing net operating income was roughly level with 2016. This was better than expected, driven by strong fourth quarter results within our lender-placed insurance and flood businesses. We made progress driving our operational excellence initiatives to mitigate declines in lender-placed. 
In 2017, we ran pilots to migrate clients onto our single processing platform, which will provide a more seamless customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies over time. So far, results are encouraging. Those savings from these efforts will not be realized until later this year and beyond. Lender-placed remains an important business for us, and all of this work will help us continue to be an innovative leader and maintain strong returns long term.
In multi-family housing, we now protect 1.8 million renters across the U.S., an increase of almost 20% from 2016. This reflects our strong suite of products and superior customer experience. In addition to working through our property management and affinity partners, we continue to innovate and now offer products through new digital channels with partnerships with companies like TenantCloud, Cozy and Sure. 
Strong growth within multi-family housing helped offset declines in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see weak market demand in new loan origination and field services. 
During 2017, we took actions to realize efficiencies in our mortgage solutions operations, including assessing our real estate footprint and operating platform. We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018, and we'll further adjust costs as needed.
Moving to Global Preneed. With $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders as well as expanded product offering for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1.9 million customers across North America.
As we look at 2018 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our scale and expertise in both the lifestyle and housing markets to continue driving profitable growth. Across our businesses, we will look to enhance our customer focuses with an emphasis on strategic account management to deepen our client relationships and continuously improve the customer experience. 
Sustaining innovation through investments in artificial intelligence in areas like the connected car, connected home, will be important. This will be balanced by a steadfast focus on operational excellence as we continue to strengthen our technology foundation, drive margin expansion and live our Assurant operating model.
We believe our talent remains a competitive advantage. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our people and further champion a culture of engagement, growth and performance as we build a stronger Assurant for the future. Our long-term commitment remains to grow earnings over time, and we're pleased that already in 2017, we have seen successful results from our transformation.
Based on our current plans for 2018, we expect Assurant net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, to be up 10% to 14% from the $412 million reported in 2017. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by a lower consolidated effective tax rate and modest growth in underlying earnings, recognizing that includes $12.5 million of net one-time benefits, which are not expected to recur.
As we announced previously, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to about 22% to 23% from 33% historically. While a significant portion of the tax savings will drive higher earnings, we currently plan to reinvest approximately 1/3 of those tax savings to support future growth across our enterprise. We will provide more details as plans are finalized by the second quarter of 2018.
Looking at underlying earnings, profitable growth is expected to be driven primarily by mobile in Connected Living, our multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses. We anticipate some additional declines in lender-placed in credit insurance, which will offset much of that growth. Expense savings from enterprise initiatives are also expected to continue. 
Operating earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, are expected to grow more than net operating income, driven by share repurchase activity during the past year. Our current outlook for 2018 does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing plan. We'll update our outlook for the year when appropriate. 
In addition, we will refresh our long-term metrics and targets to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations. As we've stated previously, we are confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long term and that our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,549709261,1385634,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2018",2018-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations.

Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower reportable catastrophes, the absence of $20 million of lender-placed regulatory expenses and more income from processing a substantially higher volume of claims under the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, following Hurricane Harvey. We've now closed more than 90% of our NFIP flood claims, so we do not expect this level of income to continue into 2018. 
In addition, fourth quarter 2017 results also reflected more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. In the first half of 2018, however, we expect non-catastrophe losses to increase to more normalized levels as well as reflecting typical winter and spring seasonality. Growth in multi-family housing and the new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier this year also contributed to a strong fourth quarter. We will continue to see declines in the lender-placed portfolio in 2018, but at a slower pace.
Looking at our key metrics. The risk-based combined portfolio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses decreased to 75.2% from 105% in the prior year period. Net reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $3.2 million pretax, a $62 million year-over-year decrease. Fourth quarter 2017 losses were mainly related to California wildfires and were partially offset by a reduction in reinstatement premiums as claims for the third quarter hurricanes developed more favorably than initially expected. As a reminder, Hurricane Matthew occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in elevated claims.
Excluding catastrophe losses, the risk-based combined ratio was 74.1%, down from 88.8% in the prior year period. This improvement reflects the absence of regulatory expenses, higher-than-expected NFIP income and better-than-average non-catastrophe loss experience. The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings was down 60 basis points to 10.6% as declines in mortgage solutions were partially offset by profitable growth in multi-family housing. Valuation and field services continue to experience lower client volumes and be impacted by market conditions. 
Turning to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. Lower placement rates in lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions drove the decrease. Specifically, the placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the third quarter. This reflects both the overall improvement in the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans.
The overall reduction in Global Housing revenue was partially offset by policy growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing and premiums from new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier in 2017. We do not expect additional revenue growth from these loans in 2018.
As evidenced last year, our Catastrophe Reinsurance Program is a critical component of managing our risk. In January, we placed around 65% of our 2018 program within the traditional reinsurance market. Rates were in line with the broader market, up 5% to 10% on a blended basis. We were also able to add another multiyear layer of protection and maintained certain key features like cascading in the event of multiple storms. As we do every year, we expect to complete and announce our program in July.
For full year 2018, we expect Global Housing's underlying earnings to decline from 2017 before taking into account savings from tax reform. After reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20%, with some of the savings reinvested in the business, we expect earnings to increase. 
2018 should mark the last year of significant lender-placed declines with an expected 4 to 5 basis point quarterly reduction in the placement rate. The rollout of our new single-source processing platform is expected to drive additional efficiencies, however, not until the end of '18 and more substantially thereafter. Given this deployment schedule, our risk-based expense ratio will remain elevated through 2018.
Our multi-family housing business is expected to generate continued profitable growth, driven by the expansion of our affinity property -- affinity and property management relationships as well as increased product penetration.
With regard to mortgage solutions, market conditions are still expected to be challenging. We are working hard to improve mortgage solutions' results, and we'll continue to drive operating efficiencies to mitigate some of the market weakness. In terms of revenue, we expect Global Housing to be roughly flat in 2018 as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Moving to Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $43 million for the fourth quarter, up $8 million year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs, more favorable loss experience and a client recoverable of $5 million. We also saw continued growth from the vehicle protection business. Results were partially offset by declines from credit insurance as well as lower income from mobile repair and logistics due to lighter trading activity. We no longer expect to see an increase in trading volumes in the first quarter of 2018 as sales of new smartphones have been lower than the industry originally forecasted.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $74 million or 9% in the quarter. This excludes a program structure change made at the end of 2016 for a large service contract client. Growth was mainly from increased mobile subscribers, including newly launched programs which are performing well. Vehicle protection was also a key driver. Results were partially offset by lower mobile trade-in activity, as noted earlier. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics. The combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased in the quarter to 96.3%, up approximately 70 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the prior period. The drivers for both metrics aligned with the net operating income commentary for the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with our overall 2017 results, with Global Lifestyle earnings up 15%, including some one-time benefits. So while we expect Global Lifestyle's underlying earnings to increase in 2018, the increase is anticipated to be more modest. This is all before considering savings from tax reform.
We expect earnings growth in mobile, including programs implemented during 2017. Mobile trade-in activity will depend on the success of new phone introductions, availability of these phones and mobile carrier promotional activity.
From 2018, we also anticipate continued profitable growth in our vehicle protection business as strong sales from prior periods begin to earn. Credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% and some reinvestments to support growth, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be up more substantially in 2018.
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $4.6 million in fourth quarter net operating income, a decrease of $6.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to a $5 million software asset write-down. Revenue in Preneed was up 9%, driven mainly by growth in Canada and sales of our final need product in the U.S. from the strong sales in prior periods. Base sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower final need sales and seasonality. Sales in this segment overall tend to be lower in the fourth quarter, leading up to the holidays. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients in adjacent product offerings. We're actively monitoring the impact of this particularly harsh flu season as it may result in more elevated mortality in the first quarter. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested in the business.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $29 million, an increase of $9 million. This was due to lower investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For 2018, we expect full corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account a lower tax rate of 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.
Turning to capital. We ended the year with $540 million of total company capital or about $290 million of deployable capital adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed to the holding company totaled $108 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total dividends for the year to $229 million. This was lower than segment earnings, mostly due to a statutory deferred tax asset write-down of $95 million in the fourth quarter, following the enactment of tax reform.
In addition, $21 million of dividends were distributed from Assurant Health and Employee Benefits as we continue to release residual capital associated with these businesses. We have now distributed nearly all the capital that had previously supported these businesses and, therefore, do not anticipate any material additional dividends.
During the quarter, we also repurchased $139 million of shares and paid $30 million in shareholder dividends. We now have completed the $1.5 billion return of capital since 2016 at an average share price of $87.09.
In 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be at least equal to segment operating earnings. This is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the impact of tax reform. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, including setting aside bonds to complete our Iké investment and support The Warranty Group integration. And as always, share buyback activity will be subject to market conditions and our overall financing plan for The Warranty Group. 
We're also hard at work on integration planning, and our efforts are on track, with an expected close in the second quarter of 2018. Last week, we reviewed The Warranty Group's preliminary results for the full year. While their close process is not yet completed, results for the year finished strong and in line with our expectations. As Alan noted earlier, we plan to update our outlook, as needed, to reflect The Warranty Group acquisition and related financing plan.
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017, which provide a solid foundation to provide profitable growth in 2018, and we remain excited about our future prospects.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders while also building a stronger Assurant for the future. Specifically, for full year 2017, we generated net operating income growth of 9%, excluding reportable catastrophes, well ahead of our initial expectations to the business growth, and $12.5 million of net one-time benefits.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew by 22%, surpassing our long-term average annual target of 15%. And we completed the return of $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders, as planned.
In 2017, we also achieved key milestones in our multiyear transformation, which we believe position our company for continued profitable growth. We invested in our digital and data analytics areas, and we also established capability centers for enterprise strategic account management, customer experience, robotics and artificial intelligence. These are just a few examples of investments to strengthen our competitive advantage. 
Through our newly formed enterprise procurement group and other initiatives, we've made good progress toward our $100 million gross expense savings target. These savings, largely sourced from third-party spending, have and will fund ongoing investments in the business while expanding margins over time.
We've also continued to manage capital prudently with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Not only did we complete our return of $1.5 billion to shareholders, we also announced our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We believe this transaction positions us as a leading lifestyle provider with significant synergies, a platform for continued innovation and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.
In January, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we amended the transaction agreement to simplify the overall structure and optimize the financing plan. Importantly, tax reform provides meaningful savings to our operations, which will benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.
Let me now share some of the highlights from the year for each of our operating segments. Global Lifestyle's earnings grew 15% for the full year, ahead of our average annual growth target of 10%, as we advanced our position as a strong lifestyle competitor with an attractive product and client mix.
In Connected Living, we added new partnerships of leading global brands, such as Comcast, Apple and most recently with KDDI in Japan. We now protect over 36 million covered devices worldwide, with a growing portion of those devices leveraging our premium tech support capabilities.
Our vehicle protection business remained a strong performer in 2017 with nearly 10% revenue growth, operating ROE in the mid-teens and solid cash flow. Our results reflected continued volume growth in third-party administrators as well as our partnerships with leading OEMs.
Our acquisition of The Warranty Group will expand our reach into complementary channels such as dealer networks and national accounts, which will strengthen our overall position in the vehicle protection market. 
In Global Housing, 2017 was marked by significant weather-related activity across the Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S., which resulted in $190 million of after-tax net reportable catastrophe losses. Despite the significant devastation, our comprehensive reinsurance program provided broad multi-storm coverage to mitigate losses. And fortunately, during this time, our employees responded exceptionally well to these events, providing support to those in need. 
Looking at our underlying performance, excluding reportable catastrophes, Global Housing net operating income was roughly level with 2016. This was better than expected, driven by strong fourth quarter results within our lender-placed insurance and flood businesses. We made progress driving our operational excellence initiatives to mitigate declines in lender-placed. 
In 2017, we ran pilots to migrate clients onto our single processing platform, which will provide a more seamless customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies over time. So far, results are encouraging. Those savings from these efforts will not be realized until later this year and beyond. Lender-placed remains an important business for us, and all of this work will help us continue to be an innovative leader and maintain strong returns long term.
In multi-family housing, we now protect 1.8 million renters across the U.S., an increase of almost 20% from 2016. This reflects our strong suite of products and superior customer experience. In addition to working through our property management and affinity partners, we continue to innovate and now offer products through new digital channels with partnerships with companies like TenantCloud, Cozy and Sure. 
Strong growth within multi-family housing helped offset declines in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see weak market demand in new loan origination and field services. 
During 2017, we took actions to realize efficiencies in our mortgage solutions operations, including assessing our real estate footprint and operating platform. We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018, and we'll further adjust costs as needed.
Moving to Global Preneed. With $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders as well as expanded product offering for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1.9 million customers across North America.
As we look at 2018 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our scale and expertise in both the lifestyle and housing markets to continue driving profitable growth. Across our businesses, we will look to enhance our customer focuses with an emphasis on strategic account management to deepen our client relationships and continuously improve the customer experience. 
Sustaining innovation through investments in artificial intelligence in areas like the connected car, connected home, will be important. This will be balanced by a steadfast focus on operational excellence as we continue to strengthen our technology foundation, drive margin expansion and live our Assurant operating model.
We believe our talent remains a competitive advantage. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our people and further champion a culture of engagement, growth and performance as we build a stronger Assurant for the future. Our long-term commitment remains to grow earnings over time, and we're pleased that already in 2017, we have seen successful results from our transformation.
Based on our current plans for 2018, we expect Assurant net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, to be up 10% to 14% from the $412 million reported in 2017. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by a lower consolidated effective tax rate and modest growth in underlying earnings, recognizing that includes $12.5 million of net one-time benefits, which are not expected to recur.
As we announced previously, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to about 22% to 23% from 33% historically. While a significant portion of the tax savings will drive higher earnings, we currently plan to reinvest approximately 1/3 of those tax savings to support future growth across our enterprise. We will provide more details as plans are finalized by the second quarter of 2018.
Looking at underlying earnings, profitable growth is expected to be driven primarily by mobile in Connected Living, our multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses. We anticipate some additional declines in lender-placed in credit insurance, which will offset much of that growth. Expense savings from enterprise initiatives are also expected to continue. 
Operating earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, are expected to grow more than net operating income, driven by share repurchase activity during the past year. Our current outlook for 2018 does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing plan. We'll update our outlook for the year when appropriate. 
In addition, we will refresh our long-term metrics and targets to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations. As we've stated previously, we are confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long term and that our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term.

Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower",1736,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower reportable catastrophes, the absence of $20 million of lender-placed regulatory expenses and more income from processing a substantially higher volume of claims under the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, following Hurricane Harvey. We've now closed more than 90% of our NFIP flood claims, so we do not expect this level of income to continue into 2018. 
In addition, fourth quarter 2017 results also reflected more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. In the first half of 2018, however, we expect non-catastrophe losses to increase to more normalized levels as well as reflecting typical winter and spring seasonality. Growth in multi-family housing and the new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier this year also contributed to a strong fourth quarter. We will continue to see declines in the lender-placed portfolio in 2018, but at a slower pace.
Looking at our key metrics. The risk-based combined portfolio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses decreased to 75.2% from 105% in the prior year period. Net reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $3.2 million pretax, a $62 million year-over-year decrease. Fourth quarter 2017 losses were mainly related to California wildfires and were partially offset by a reduction in reinstatement premiums as claims for the third quarter hurricanes developed more favorably than initially expected. As a reminder, Hurricane Matthew occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in elevated claims.
Excluding catastrophe losses, the risk-based combined ratio was 74.1%, down from 88.8% in the prior year period. This improvement reflects the absence of regulatory expenses, higher-than-expected NFIP income and better-than-average non-catastrophe loss experience. The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings was down 60 basis points to 10.6% as declines in mortgage solutions were partially offset by profitable growth in multi-family housing. Valuation and field services continue to experience lower client volumes and be impacted by market conditions. 
Turning to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. Lower placement rates in lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions drove the decrease. Specifically, the placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the third quarter. This reflects both the overall improvement in the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans.
The overall reduction in Global Housing revenue was partially offset by policy growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing and premiums from new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier in 2017. We do not expect additional revenue growth from these loans in 2018.
As evidenced last year, our Catastrophe Reinsurance Program is a critical component of managing our risk. In January, we placed around 65% of our 2018 program within the traditional reinsurance market. Rates were in line with the broader market, up 5% to 10% on a blended basis. We were also able to add another multiyear layer of protection and maintained certain key features like cascading in the event of multiple storms. As we do every year, we expect to complete and announce our program in July.
For full year 2018, we expect Global Housing's underlying earnings to decline from 2017 before taking into account savings from tax reform. After reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20%, with some of the savings reinvested in the business, we expect earnings to increase. 
2018 should mark the last year of significant lender-placed declines with an expected 4 to 5 basis point quarterly reduction in the placement rate. The rollout of our new single-source processing platform is expected to drive additional efficiencies, however, not until the end of '18 and more substantially thereafter. Given this deployment schedule, our risk-based expense ratio will remain elevated through 2018.
Our multi-family housing business is expected to generate continued profitable growth, driven by the expansion of our affinity property -- affinity and property management relationships as well as increased product penetration.
With regard to mortgage solutions, market conditions are still expected to be challenging. We are working hard to improve mortgage solutions' results, and we'll continue to drive operating efficiencies to mitigate some of the market weakness. In terms of revenue, we expect Global Housing to be roughly flat in 2018 as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Moving to Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $43 million for the fourth quarter, up $8 million year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs, more favorable loss experience and a client recoverable of $5 million. We also saw continued growth from the vehicle protection business. Results were partially offset by declines from credit insurance as well as lower income from mobile repair and logistics due to lighter trading activity. We no longer expect to see an increase in trading volumes in the first quarter of 2018 as sales of new smartphones have been lower than the industry originally forecasted.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $74 million or 9% in the quarter. This excludes a program structure change made at the end of 2016 for a large service contract client. Growth was mainly from increased mobile subscribers, including newly launched programs which are performing well. Vehicle protection was also a key driver. Results were partially offset by lower mobile trade-in activity, as noted earlier. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics. The combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased in the quarter to 96.3%, up approximately 70 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the prior period. The drivers for both metrics aligned with the net operating income commentary for the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with our overall 2017 results, with Global Lifestyle earnings up 15%, including some one-time benefits. So while we expect Global Lifestyle's underlying earnings to increase in 2018, the increase is anticipated to be more modest. This is all before considering savings from tax reform.
We expect earnings growth in mobile, including programs implemented during 2017. Mobile trade-in activity will depend on the success of new phone introductions, availability of these phones and mobile carrier promotional activity.
From 2018, we also anticipate continued profitable growth in our vehicle protection business as strong sales from prior periods begin to earn. Credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% and some reinvestments to support growth, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be up more substantially in 2018.
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $4.6 million in fourth quarter net operating income, a decrease of $6.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to a $5 million software asset write-down. Revenue in Preneed was up 9%, driven mainly by growth in Canada and sales of our final need product in the U.S. from the strong sales in prior periods. Base sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower final need sales and seasonality. Sales in this segment overall tend to be lower in the fourth quarter, leading up to the holidays. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients in adjacent product offerings. We're actively monitoring the impact of this particularly harsh flu season as it may result in more elevated mortality in the first quarter. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested in the business.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $29 million, an increase of $9 million. This was due to lower investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For 2018, we expect full corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account a lower tax rate of 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.
Turning to capital. We ended the year with $540 million of total company capital or about $290 million of deployable capital adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed to the holding company totaled $108 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total dividends for the year to $229 million. This was lower than segment earnings, mostly due to a statutory deferred tax asset write-down of $95 million in the fourth quarter, following the enactment of tax reform.
In addition, $21 million of dividends were distributed from Assurant Health and Employee Benefits as we continue to release residual capital associated with these businesses. We have now distributed nearly all the capital that had previously supported these businesses and, therefore, do not anticipate any material additional dividends.
During the quarter, we also repurchased $139 million of shares and paid $30 million in shareholder dividends. We now have completed the $1.5 billion return of capital since 2016 at an average share price of $87.09.
In 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be at least equal to segment operating earnings. This is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the impact of tax reform. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, including setting aside bonds to complete our Iké investment and support The Warranty Group integration. And as always, share buyback activity will be subject to market conditions and our overall financing plan for The Warranty Group. 
We're also hard at work on integration planning, and our efforts are on track, with an expected close in the second quarter of 2018. Last week, we reviewed The Warranty Group's preliminary results for the full year. While their close process is not yet completed, results for the year finished strong and in line with our expectations. As Alan noted earlier, we plan to update our outlook, as needed, to reflect The Warranty Group acquisition and related financing plan.
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017, which provide a solid foundation to provide profitable growth in 2018, and we remain excited about our future prospects.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We will start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings news release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During the first quarter, we completed the financing related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. This included a $1.3 billion debt issuance, of which $350 million replaced debt that matured during the quarter, and a $288 million mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, our first quarter 2018 results and full year 2018 outlook do not include any contributions from The Warranty Group nor the impact of the $1.2 billion of acquisition-related financing. 
Prior to closing, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share will exclude the interest expense and the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition financing. These amounts, however, will be reflected in our GAAP results. Once the transaction closes, we will include the related interest expense and dilutive impact of the shares and operating results using the if converted accounting methodology. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on Assurant.com.

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings",1055,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings increase as well as modest underlying business growth. This growth was partially offset by increased corporate expenses and higher catastrophe losses. 
We also continued to make good progress preparing for the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition. This included submitting the required filings and raising the necessary funds to support the acquisition. Integration planning efforts continue and position us well, post closing. Our teams have developed detailed roadmaps to successfully bring together our business operations within Global Lifestyle, leveraging our combined talent and product offerings worldwide.  So far we have received several regulatory approvals and still expect to close the transaction in the second quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory and customary closing approvals. 
Overall, we remain bullish on the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and also more broadly across our key lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Housing, our focus remains on sustaining our leadership position within lender-placed insurance. This quarter, we migrated our first significant client to our single processing platform. As this work continues, we expect to drive net savings later this year, with more expected in 2019 and beyond. This will help us maintain strong returns within lender-placed and deliver an even better customer experience. 
With over 1.8 million insured renters, our multi-family housing business continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we extended our resident bond offering to include commercial property owners, management companies and their tenants. Now both residential and commercial property managers can offer a surety bond payment as an alternative to a security deposit. This increases protection, while also reducing the tenant's upfront moving costs. 
As we look to further expand our presence in the rental economy, we recently launched a partnership with [ Department Jet ] to provide multi-family housing owners and insurance solution that covers both nightly and extended-stay guests. 
While we were pleased with the performance and growth momentum within multi-family housing, mortgage solutions results remained disappointing. Ongoing weak client demand and soft market conditions, especially in new loan originations and field services, continue to pressure results in the first quarter. We expect this environment will remain challenging for the rest of the year. 
While mortgage solutions is not a significant portion of the segment's results, we are continuing to aggressively take actions to improve performance. This includes continuing to manage expenses, while actively pursuing new business opportunities. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle, we continue to expand our mobile business, now protecting 38 million devices worldwide. The significant portion of that increase is coming from our continued success with KDDI, the second largest carrier in Japan. Since year-end, enrollments in that program nearly doubled. We expect to continue to strengthen our mobile business in the region building on our accomplishments in Japan, South Korea and Australia and also leveraging The Warranty Group's existing footprint in Asia. 
While first quarter results in the vehicle business were lower, we saw sustained double-digit revenue growth from strong prior period sales from third-party administrators, recreational vehicle distributors and our partnerships with leading OEMs. We now protect 15 million vehicles. Along with The Warranty Group, we believe we can further extend our leadership position and capitalize on emerging growth trends over time. 
We also continued to make select investments in the Connected Living market. During the quarter, this included strengthening our connected home capabilities through an investment in a company, which specializes in home installation and technical support services. We also made a modest investment in an Asia Pacific trade-in and device disposition provider as we reinforced our presence in that region. 
Overall, we believe our efforts to maintain growth momentum and to drive margin improvement across our portfolio, positions us well to deliver profitable growth in 2018. 
Turning to our financial results, we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income; net operating income per diluted share; and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. These metrics exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of TWG and our recently completed acquisition financing. 
For the first quarter, Assurant's net operating income increased by 8% to [ $115 million ] compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying growth in the business, offset mainly by higher corporate expenses.  Operating earnings per diluted share was $2.14, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting both growth in earnings and 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.2%, up 40 basis points since year-end. 
For full year 2018, we continue to expect Assurant's standalone net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 10% to 14% from 2017 reported results of $413 million. This reflects a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying segment earnings growth. 
Expansion within our Connected Living, multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses are expected to offset ongoing declines in lender-placed and credit insurance. 
As we previously communicated, we'll be redeploying a portion of the tax savings to support growth long-term, with investments accelerating later this year. As always, we will continue to focus on actively reducing expenses to expand margins over time. 
For 2018, we also continue to expect net operating income per diluted share to grow in excess of net operating income, benefiting from 2017 share repurchase activity. This outlook does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing. We will update our outlook for the year to include TWG, sometime in the third quarter. 
In regard to our longer-term financial metrics and targets, we plan to refresh those to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations at a later date. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow, long-term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long-term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our first quarter 2018 results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,558647963,1449562,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 04, 2018",2018-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additi",1674,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additional income. Results also reflected $8 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the severe winter storms in the Northeast. 
Excluding both the reportable catastrophes and the impact of tax reform, underlying earnings increased slightly. Higher contributions from international housing products, growth in multi-family housing and modest income from processing the residual flood claims from Hurricane Harvey were the key drivers. The increase was partially offset by ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses increased to 85.3% from 82.9% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher reportable catastrophes noted earlier. Excluding cash, the risk-based combined ratio was roughly flat. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based capital-light offerings increased to 11.4% from 8.8% in the first quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multi-family and housing. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing, net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the first quarter. Lower placement rates and reductions in real estate owned volumes in lender-placed drove the decline. Fee income was impacted by a decrease in mortgage solutions, as Alan mentioned earlier. The placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall improvement in the housing market and the higher mix of low placement loans.  For the rest of the year, we expect ongoing declines in the placement rate, averaging 4 to 5 basis points per quarter, assuming continued growth in the housing market.  The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by continued growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing. 
For 2018, we continue to expect Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. A portion of tax savings is expected to be reinvested into the segment for future growth later this year. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should be lower as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and mortgage solution declines. Continued profitable growth in multi-family housing, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased product penetration, will help to mitigate the decrease.
Moving to Global Lifestyle, this segment reported earnings of $56 million for the first quarter compared to $52 million in the prior period of last year. The first quarter of 2017 included $7.5 million of onetime client recoverables. Excluding this disclosed item and the $7 million benefit from tax reform, net operating income increased $4 million. 
Underlying results benefited from mobile growth within Connected Living, which was largely attributable to the new mobile programs implemented last year as well as growth from existing clients. We also recorded a benefit related to the revised client contract terms. While this is part of our normal course of business operations, the benefit was higher-than-anticipated and is not expected to recur in the second quarter. Results were partially offset by less favorable vehicle protection results and lower earnings from our U.S. credit business.
Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up 14% in the quarter. Contributions from new mobile programs, including subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection, were partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in volumes. 
Looking at this segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses increased to 99.1% from 92.2%. This was mainly due to less favorable results in the vehicle protection business, including elevated expenses and higher loss experienced compared to a favorable prior period. 
As a reminder, the prior year period also included $4.3 million pretax benefit from a onetime client recoverable in the credit business. Excluding this benefit, the combined ratio increased 5.6 points due to the factors noted earlier. 
The pretax margin for fee-based capital-light businesses was 8.2% in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the prior year period. Excluding the $6.7 million of client recoverables from last year, the margin expanded 2.3 points, driven by profitable growth in new and existing programs. Overall, lower margins from trade-in activity partially offset this increase.
We are pleased with lifestyle's first quarter results. For the full year, we still believe net operating income growth will be modest before taking into account tax reform. Mobile will remain a significant contributor, driven by growth from programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion of our offerings with existing clients. In addition, as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate depending on success of new phone introductions and mobile carrier promotional activity. 
Despite a softer first quarter for the vehicle business, we continue to expect profitable growth for 2018 as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn. Contributions from credit insurance however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.
As always, across our business, we will continue to manage expenses. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate, now expected to be roughly 22% to 24%, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be even higher in 2018. While a portion of tax savings are expected to be reinvested into the business for future growth, we anticipate the investments to occur during the latter part of the year. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $10 million in first quarter, net operating income consistent with the prior year period. Excluding the $2 million benefit from the lower tax rate, earnings were down. This was primarily related to higher IT expenses as we transitioned to a new operating platform. 
Despite the harsh flu season this year, Mortality was only slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was also seasonally high. Revenue in Preneed was up 5%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S, including sales of our final Preneed product in prior periods.  Base sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower final need sales as we shifted the focus to higher return multipay products. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients in adjacent product offerings. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of approximately 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested into the business later in 2018. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million, a year-over-year increase of $10 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses compared to a favorable prior period and a $2 million adverse effect from the lower tax rate. For 2018, we continue to expect the full year Corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million. 
Turning to capital, excluding the $1.2 billion of financing proceeds related to The Warranty Group acquisition, we ended March with $575 million in total company capital or about $325 million of deployable capital, after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends in the quarter from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $182 million, which included $140 million of capital related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, following tax reform. This increased our dividend capacity, providing more cash to the holding company and allowed us to lower the amount of equity issued as part of our TWG financing, effectively bringing forward the share repurchases originally planned for later this year. As a result, we did not purchase any shares in the quarter. 
In terms of uses of cash, we did however, pay $30 million in shareholder dividends and paid $42 million for the final claims reserve settlement associated with the 2015 sale of our General Agency business. This settlement payment was previously accrued for, and therefore, had no material impact to our income statement. 
And finally, we invested $8 million towards strengthening our Connected Home and asset disposition capabilities as Alan mentioned earlier.
In 2018, we now expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings because of the increased dividends made available following the reduction in our deferred tax liability. Dividends from the underlying businesses are [indiscernible] overall, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the growth of the businesses. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and support The Warranty Group integration. We continue to believe share buyback activity will be unlikely for the balance of the year, but we will revisit, post close. 
As noted earlier, following the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition, we will update our presentation and results and outlook for the full year. Among other things, post closing, our net operating income will include The Warranty Group results and approximately $36 million after tax of additional annual interest expense related to the acquisition debt financing. This also accounts for the amortization of gains from derivative transactions that were used to hedge interest rate risk. 
And for the purposes of net operating income per diluted share, results will reflect the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock on and if converted accounting basis. Prior to closing however, the impact of the $1.2 billion acquisition financing will only impact GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share. 
In the next few weeks, we expect to file a summary of TWG's first quarter results. At this stage, in their post-process, we believe the business performance continues to track against our expectations and reflects ongoing momentum in their vehicle business. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year.  And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

But if I think about that 15% ROE target that suggests your earnings needs to be somewhere between $800 million and $900 million a few years from now, I know TWG is going to add a significant amount to that, but it still feels like there is a pretty big gap to get there.

And when you get into 2019 and 2020 with lender-placed normalization nearing its end, we are well positioned to grow earnings rapidly as Assurant. And then we have opportunities to manage that equity and to go through combined operations and release and capital out of our businesses. With all that said, we are going to, later this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, look at the combined company and put out what we think are the right long term metrics.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings news release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During the first quarter, we completed the financing related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. This included a $1.3 billion debt issuance, of which $350 million replaced debt that matured during the quarter, and a $288 million mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, our first quarter 2018 results and full year 2018 outlook do not include any contributions from The Warranty Group nor the impact of the $1.2 billion of acquisition-related financing. 
Prior to closing, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share will exclude the interest expense and dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition financing. These amounts, however, will be reflected in our GAAP results. Once the transaction closes, we will include the related interest expense and dilutive impact of the shares and operating results using the if-converted accounting methodology. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings",1053,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings increase as well as modest underlying business growth. This growth was partially offset by increased corporate expenses and higher catastrophe losses. 
We also continue to make good progress preparing for the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition. This included submitting the required filings and raising the necessary funds to support the acquisition. Integration planning efforts continue and position us well post-closing. Our teams have developed detailed road maps to successfully bring together our business operations within Global Lifestyle, leveraging our combined talent and product offerings worldwide.  
So far, we have received several regulatory approvals and still expect to close the transaction in the second quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory and customary closing approvals. Overall, we remain bullish on the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and also, more broadly, across our key lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Housing, our focus remains on sustaining our leadership position within lender-placed insurance. This quarter, we migrated our first significant client to our single processing platform. As this work continues, we expect to drive net savings later this year, with more expected in 2019 and beyond. This will help us maintain strong returns within lender-placed and deliver an even better customer experience. 
With over 1.8 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we extended our resident bond offering to include commercial property owners, management companies and their tenants. Now both residential and commercial property managers can offer a surety bond payment as an alternative to a security deposit. This increases protection, while also reducing the tenant's upfront move-in cost. 
As we look to further expand our presence in the rental economy, we recently launched a partnership with ApartmentJet to provide multifamily housing owners an insurance solution that covers both nightly and extended-stay guests. 
While we were pleased with the performance and growth momentum within multifamily housing, mortgage solutions results remained disappointing. Ongoing weak client demand and soft market conditions, especially in new loan originations and field services, continue to pressure results in the first quarter. We expect this environment will remain challenging for the rest of the year. 
While mortgage solutions is not a significant portion of the segment's results, we are continuing to aggressively take actions to improve performance. This includes continuing to manage expenses, while actively pursuing new business opportunities. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle, we continue to expand our mobile business, now protecting 38 million devices worldwide. The significant portion of that increase is coming from our continued success with KDDI, the second-largest carrier in Japan. Since year-end, enrollments in that program nearly doubled. We expect to continue to strengthen our mobile business in the region building on our recent accomplishments in Japan, South Korea and Australia, and also leveraging The Warranty Group's existing footprint in Asia. 
While first quarter results in the vehicle business were lower, we saw sustained double-digit revenue growth from strong prior period sales from third-party administrators, recreational vehicle distributors and our partnerships with leading OEMs. We now protect 15 million vehicles. Along with The Warranty Group, we believe we can further extend our leadership position and capitalize on emerging growth trends over time. 
We also continue to make select investments in the Connected Living market. During the quarter, this included strengthening our connected home capabilities through an investment in a company which specializes in home installation and technical support services. We also made a modest investment in an Asia Pacific trade-in and device disposition provider as we reinforced our presence in that region. 
Overall, we believe our efforts to maintain growth momentum and to drive margin improvement across our portfolio positions us well to deliver profitable growth in 2018. 
Turning to our financial results, we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. These metrics exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of TWG and our recently completed acquisition financing. 
For the first quarter, Assurant's net operating income increased by 8% to $115 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying growth in the business, offset mainly by higher corporate expenses. Operating earnings per diluted share was $2.14, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting both growth in earnings and 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.2%, up 40 basis points since year-end. 
For full year 2018, we continue to expect Assurant's standalone net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 10% to 14% from 2017 reported results of $413 million. This reflects a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying segment earnings growth. 
Expansion within our Connected Living, multifamily housing and vehicle protection businesses are expected to offset ongoing declines in lender-placed and credit insurance. 
As we previously communicated, we'll be redeploying a portion of the tax savings to support growth long term, with investments accelerating later this year. As always, we will continue to focus on actively reducing expenses to expand margins over time. 
For 2018, we also continue to expect net operating income per diluted share to grow in excess of net operating income, benefiting from 2017 share repurchase activity. This outlook does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing. We will update our outlook for the year to include TWG, sometime in the third quarter. 
In regard to our longer-term financial metrics and targets, we plan to refresh those to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations at a later date. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our first quarter 2018 results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,558647963,1449713,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 04, 2018",2018-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of addi",1678,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. 
Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additional income. Results also reflected $8 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the severe winter storms in the Northeast. 
Excluding both the reportable catastrophes and the impact of tax reform, underlying earnings increased slightly. Higher contributions from international housing products, growth in multifamily housing and modest income from processing the residual flood claims from Hurricane Harvey were the key drivers. The increase was partially offset by ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses increased to 85.3% from 82.9% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher reportable catastrophes noted earlier. Excluding cats, the risk-based combined ratio was roughly flat. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 11.4% from 8.8% in the first quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the first quarter. Lower placement rates and reductions in real estate owned volumes in lender-placed drove the decline. Fee income was impacted by a decrease in mortgage solutions, as Alan mentioned earlier. 
The placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall improvement in the housing market and the higher mix of low placement loans.  
For the rest of the year, we expect ongoing declines in the placement rate, averaging 4 to 5 basis points per quarter, assuming continued growth in the housing market.  The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by continued growth, mainly from affinity partners in multifamily housing. 
For 2018, we continue to expect Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. A portion of tax savings is expected to be reinvested into the segment for future growth later this year. 
Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should be lower as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and mortgage solution declines. Continued profitable growth in multifamily housing, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships, as well as increased product penetration, will help to mitigate the decrease. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, this segment reported earnings of $56 million for the first quarter compared to $52 million in the prior period of last year. The first quarter of 2017 included $7.5 million of onetime client recoverables. Excluding this disclosed item and the $7 million benefit from tax reform, net operating income increased $4 million. 
Underlying results benefited from mobile growth within Connected Living, which was largely attributable to the new mobile programs implemented last year as well as growth from existing clients. We also recorded a benefit related to the revised client contract terms. While this is part of our normal course of business operations, the benefit was higher-than-anticipated and is not expected to recur in the second quarter. Results were partially offset by less favorable vehicle protection results and lower earnings from our U.S. credit business.
Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up 14% in the quarter. Contributions from new mobile programs, including subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection, were partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in volumes. 
Looking at this segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses increased to 99.1% from 92.2%. This was mainly due to less favorable results in the vehicle protection business, including elevated expenses and higher loss experience compared to a favorable prior period. 
As a reminder, the prior year period also included $4.3 million pretax benefit from a onetime client recoverable in the credit business. Excluding this benefit, the combined ratio increased 5.6 points due to the factors noted earlier. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 8.2% in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the prior year period. Excluding the $6.7 million of client recoverables from last year, the margin expanded 2.3 points, driven by profitable growth in new and existing programs. Overall, lower margins on trade-in activity partially offset this increase.
We are pleased with Lifestyle's first quarter results. For the full year, we still believe net operating income growth will be modest before taking into account tax reform. Mobile will remain a significant contributor, driven by growth from programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion of our offerings with existing clients. In addition, as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate depending on the success of new phone introductions and mobile carrier promotional activity. 
Despite a softer first quarter for the vehicle business, we continue to expect profitable growth for 2018 as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn. Contributions from credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.
As always, across our business, we will continue to manage expenses. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate, now expected to be roughly 22% to 24%, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be even higher in 2018. While a portion of tax savings are expected to be reinvested into the business for future growth, we anticipate the investments to occur during the latter part of the year. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $10 million in the first quarter net operating income, consistent with the prior year period. Excluding the $2 million benefit from the lower tax rate, earnings were down. This was primarily related to higher IT expenses as we transitioned to a new operating platform. 
Despite the harsh flu season this year, mortality was only slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was also seasonally high. Revenue in Preneed was up 5%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S, including sales of our Final Preneed product in prior periods. Base sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower Final Need sales as we shift the focus to higher-return multipay products. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of approximately 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested into the business later in 2018. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million, a year-over-year increase of $10 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses compared to a favorable prior period and a $2 million adverse effect from the lower tax rate. 
For 2018, we continue to expect the full year Corporate net operating loss to be approximately at level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million. 
Turning to capital, excluding the $1.2 billion of financing proceeds related to The Warranty Group acquisition, we ended March with $575 million in total company capital or about $325 million of deployable capital, after adjusting for our risk buffer. 
Dividends in the quarter from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $182 million, which included $140 million of capital related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, following tax reform. This increased our dividend capacity, providing more cash to the holding company and allowed us to lower the amount of equity issued as part of our TWG financing, effectively bringing forward the share repurchases originally planned for later this year. As a result, we did not purchase any shares in the quarter. 
In terms of uses of cash, we did, however, pay $30 million in shareholder dividends and paid $42 million worth of final claims reserve settlement associated with the 2015 sale of our general agency business. This settlement payment was previously accrued for, and therefore, had no material impact to our income statement. 
And finally, we invested $8 million towards strengthening our connected home and asset disposition capabilities, as Alan mentioned earlier.
In 2018, we now expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings because of the increased dividends made available following the reduction in our deferred tax liability. Dividends from the underlying businesses are expected to approximate segment earnings. 
Overall, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the growth of the businesses. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and support The Warranty Group integration. We continue to believe share buyback activity will be unlikely for the balance of the year, but we will revisit, post close. 
As noted earlier, following the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition, we will update our presentation and results and outlook for the full year. Among other things, post-closing, our net operating income will include The Warranty Group results and approximately $36 million after tax of additional annual interest expense related to the acquisition debt financing. This also accounts for the amortization of gains from derivative transactions that were used to hedge interest rate risk. 
And for the purposes of net operating income per diluted share, results will reflect the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted accounting basis. Prior to closing, however, the impact of the $1.2 billion acquisition financing will only impact GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share. 
In the next few weeks, we expect to file a summary of TWG's first quarter results. At this stage in their post process, we believe the business performance continues to track against our expectations and reflects ongoing momentum in their vehicle business. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

But if I think about that 15% ROE target it suggests your earnings need to be somewhere between $800 million and $900 million a few years from now. I know TWG is going to add a significant amount to that, but it still feels like there is a pretty big gap to get there.

And when you get into 2019 and 2020 with lender-placed normalization nearing its end, we are well positioned to grow earnings rapidly as Assurant. And then we have opportunities to manage that equity and to go through combined operations and release some capital out of our businesses. With all that said, we are going to, later this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, look at the combined company and put out what we think are the right long-term metrics. But for now, we feel like we have momentum toward that ROE target, as I mentioned, we're up 40 basis points versus year-end. And we see good progress in our company."

And that was in an era when our rates were substantially higher than voluntary products. You fast forward to today, we've completely redone the product over the last 5 years. Our product is actually relatively competitive now with the existing voluntary products. And so what we're finding now is we're having greater consumer choice to pick our product, and then there's always going to be some level of volume that comes from the foreclosed inventory, the seriously delinquent, that's move into foreclosure, that's moved into REO. Which is why we feel pretty well positioned that even the placement rate was going to continue to modulate a little bit, which it could if the housing market was very strong, we're not far from the bottom at this point.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings news release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During the first quarter, we completed the financing related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. This included a $1.3 billion debt issuance, of which $350 million replaced debt that matured during the quarter, and a $288 million mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, our first quarter 2018 results and full year 2018 outlook do not include any contributions from The Warranty Group nor the impact of the $1.2 billion of acquisition-related financing. 
Prior to closing, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share will exclude the interest expense and dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition financing. These amounts, however, will be reflected in our GAAP results. Once the transaction closes, we will include the related interest expense and dilutive impact of the shares in operating results using the if-converted accounting methodology. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations.

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings increase as well as modest underlying business growth. This growth was partially offset by increased corporate expenses and higher catastrophe losses. 
We also continue to make good progress preparing for the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition. This included submitting the required filings and raising the necessary funds to support the acquisition. Integration planning efforts continue and position us well post-closing. Our teams have developed detailed road maps to successfully bring together our business operations within Global Lifestyle, leveraging our combined talent and product offerings worldwide.  
So far, we have received several regulatory approvals and still expect to close the transaction in the second quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory and customary closing approvals. Overall, we remain bullish on the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and also, more broadly, across our key lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Housing, our focus remains on sustaining our leadership position within lender-placed insurance. This quarter, we migrated our first significant client to our single processing platform. As this work continues, we expect to drive net savings later this year, with more expected in 2019 and beyond. This will help us maintain strong returns within lender-placed and deliver an even better customer experience. 
With over 1.8 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we extended our resident bond offering to include commercial property owners, management companies and their tenants. Now both residential and commercial property managers can offer a surety bond payment as an alternative to a security deposit. This increases protection, while also reducing the tenant's upfront move-in cost. 
As we look to further expand our presence in the rental economy, we recently launched a partnership with ApartmentJet to provide multifamily housing owners an insurance solution that covers both nightly and extended-stay guests. 
While we were pleased with the performance and growth momentum within multifamily housing, mortgage solutions results remained disappointing. Ongoing weak client demand and soft market conditions, especially in new loan originations and field services, continue to pressure results in the first quarter. We expect this environment will remain challenging for the rest of the year. 
While mortgage solutions is not a significant portion of the segment's results, we are continuing to aggressively take actions to improve performance. This includes continuing to manage expenses, while actively pursuing new business opportunities. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle, we continue to expand our mobile business, now protecting 38 million devices worldwide. The significant portion of that increase is coming from our continued success with KDDI, the second-largest carrier in Japan. Since year-end, enrollments in that program nearly doubled. We expect to continue to strengthen our mobile business in the region building on our recent accomplishments in Japan, South Korea and Australia, and also leveraging The Warranty Group's existing footprint in Asia. 
While first quarter results in the vehicle business were lower, we saw sustained double-digit revenue growth from strong prior period sales from third-party administrators, recreational vehicle distributors and our partnerships with leading OEMs. We now protect 15 million vehicles. Along with The Warranty Group, we believe we can further extend our leadership position and capitalize on emerging growth trends over time. 
We also continue to make select investments in the Connected Living market. During the quarter, this included strengthening our connected home capabilities through an investment in a company which specializes in home installation and technical support services. We also made a modest investment in an Asia Pacific trade-in and device disposition provider as we reinforced our presence in that region. 
Overall, we believe our efforts to maintain growth momentum and to drive margin improvement across our portfolio positions us well to deliver profitable growth in 2018. 
Turning to our financial results, we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. These metrics exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of TWG and our recently completed acquisition financing. 
For the first quarter, Assurant's net operating income increased by 8% to $115 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying growth in the business, offset mainly by higher corporate expenses. Operating earnings per diluted share was $2.14, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting both growth in earnings and 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.2%, up 40 basis points since year-end. 
For full year 2018, we continue to expect Assurant's standalone net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 10% to 14% from 2017 reported results of $413 million. This reflects a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying segment earnings growth. 
Expansion within our Connected Living, multifamily housing and vehicle protection businesses are expected to offset ongoing declines in lender-placed and credit insurance. 
As we previously communicated, we'll be redeploying a portion of the tax savings to support growth long term, with investments accelerating later this year. As always, we will continue to focus on actively reducing expenses to expand margins over time. 
For 2018, we also continue to expect net operating income per diluted share to grow in excess of net operating income, benefiting from 2017 share repurchase activity. This outlook does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing. We will update our outlook for the year to include TWG, sometime in the third quarter. 
In regard to our longer-term financial metrics and targets, we plan to refresh those to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations at a later date. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our first quarter 2018 results in greater detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additional income. Results also reflected $8 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the severe winter storms in the Northeast. 
Excluding both the reportable catastrophes and the impact of tax reform, underlying earnings increased slightly. Higher contributions from international housing products, growth in multifamily housing and modest income from processing the residual flood claims from Hurricane Harvey were the key drivers. The increase was partially offset by ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses increased to 85.3% from 82.9% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher reportable catastrophes noted earlier. Excluding cats, the risk-based combined ratio was roughly flat. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 11.4% from 8.8% in the first quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the first quarter. Lower placement rates and reductions in real estate owned volumes in lender-placed drove the decline. Fee income was impacted by a decrease in mortgage solutions, as Alan mentioned earlier. 
The placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall improvement in the housing market and the higher mix of low placement loans.  
For the rest of the year, we expect ongoing declines in the placement rate, averaging 4 to 5 basis points per quarter, assuming continued growth in the housing market.  The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by continued growth, mainly from affinity partners in multifamily housing. 
For 2018, we continue to expect Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. A portion of tax savings is expected to be reinvested into the segment for future growth later this year. 
Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should be lower as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and mortgage solution declines. Continued profitable growth in multifamily housing, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships, as well as increased product penetration, will help to mitigate the decrease. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, this segment reported earnings of $56 million for the first quarter compared to $52 million in the prior period of last year. The first quarter of 2017 included $7.5 million of onetime client recoverables. Excluding this disclosed item and the $7 million benefit from tax reform, net operating income increased $4 million. 
Underlying results benefited from mobile growth within Connected Living, which was largely attributable to the new mobile programs implemented last year as well as growth from existing clients. We also recorded a benefit related to the revised client contract terms. While this is part of our normal course of business operations, the benefit was higher-than-anticipated and is not expected to recur in the second quarter. Results were partially offset by less favorable vehicle protection results and lower earnings from our U.S. credit business.
Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up 14% in the quarter. Contributions from new mobile programs, including subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection, were partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in volumes. 
Looking at this segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses increased to 99.1% from 92.2%. This was mainly due to less favorable results in the vehicle protection business, including elevated expenses and higher loss experience compared to a favorable prior period. 
As a reminder, the prior year period also included $4.3 million pretax benefit from a onetime client recoverable in the credit business. Excluding this benefit, the combined ratio increased 5.6 points due to the factors noted earlier. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 8.2% in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the prior year period. Excluding the $6.7 million of client recoverables from last year, the margin expanded 2.3 points, driven by profitable growth in new and existing programs. Overall, lower margins on trade-in activity partially offset this increase.
We are pleased with Lifestyle's first quarter results. For the full year, we still believe net operating income growth will be modest before taking into account tax reform. Mobile will remain a significant contributor, driven by growth from programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion of our offerings with existing clients. In addition, as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate depending on the success of new phone introductions and mobile carrier promotional activity. 
Despite a softer first quarter for the vehicle business, we continue to expect profitable growth for 2018 as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn. Contributions from credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.
As always, across our business, we will continue to manage expenses. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate, now expected to be roughly 22% to 24%, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be even higher in 2018. While a portion of tax savings are expected to be reinvested into the business for future growth, we anticipate the investments to occur during the latter part of the year. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $10 million in the first quarter net operating income, consistent with the prior year period. Excluding the $2 million benefit from the lower tax rate, earnings were down. This was primarily related to higher IT expenses as we transitioned to a new operating platform. 
Despite the harsh flu season this year, mortality was only slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was also seasonally high. Revenue in Preneed was up 5%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S, including sales of our Final Preneed product in prior periods. Base sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower Final Need sales as we shift the focus to higher-return multipay products. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of approximately 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested into the business later in 2018. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million, a year-over-year increase of $10 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses compared to a favorable prior period and a $2 million adverse effect from the lower tax rate. 
For 2018, we continue to expect the full year Corporate net operating loss to be approximately at level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million. 
Turning to capital, excluding the $1.2 billion of financing proceeds related to The Warranty Group acquisition, we ended March with $575 million in total company capital or about $325 million of deployable capital, after adjusting for our risk buffer. 
Dividends in the quarter from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $182 million, which included $140 million of capital related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, following tax reform. This increased our dividend capacity, providing more cash to the holding company and allowed us to lower the amount of equity issued as part of our TWG financing, effectively bringing forward the share repurchases originally planned for later this year. As a result, we did not purchase any shares in the quarter. 
In terms of uses of cash, we did, however, pay $30 million in shareholder dividends and paid $42 million worth of final claims reserve settlement associated with the 2015 sale of our general agency business. This settlement payment was previously accrued for, and therefore, had no material impact to our income statement. 
And finally, we invested $8 million towards strengthening our connected home and asset disposition capabilities, as Alan mentioned earlier.
In 2018, we now expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings because of the increased dividends made available following the reduction in our deferred tax liability. Dividends from the underlying businesses are expected to approximate segment earnings. 
Overall, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the growth of the businesses. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and support The Warranty Group integration. We continue to believe share buyback activity will be unlikely for the balance of the year, but we will revisit, post close. 
As noted earlier, following the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition, we will update our presentation and results and outlook for the full year. Among other things, post-closing, our net operating income will include The Warranty Group results and approximately $36 million after tax of additional annual interest expense related to the acquisition debt financing. This also accounts for the amortization of gains from derivative transactions that were used to hedge interest rate risk. 
And for the purposes of net operating income per diluted share, results will reflect the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted accounting basis. Prior to closing, however, the impact of the $1.2 billion acquisition financing will only impact GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share. 
In the next few weeks, we expect to file a summary of TWG's first quarter results. At this stage in their post process, we believe the business performance continues to track against our expectations and reflects ongoing momentum in their vehicle business. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Well, we will revisit post close. But for now, the expectation is that we don't anticipate further buybacks this year."

But the way to think about this is before the crisis, if you go back to the '05, '06 type range, we had placement rates, call it, 1.5%, a little bit around that range, and that was largely from voluntary purchase by consumers. And that was in an era when our rates were substantially higher than voluntary products. You fast forward to today, we've completely redone the product over the last 5 years. Our product is actually relatively competitive now with the existing voluntary products. And so what we're finding now is we're having greater consumer choice to pick our product, and then there's always going to be some level of volume that comes from the foreclosed inventory, the seriously delinquent, that's move into foreclosure, that's moved into REO. Which is why we feel pretty well positioned that even the placement rate was going to continue to modulate a little bit, which it could if the housing market was very strong, we're not far from the bottom at this point.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings news release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During the first quarter, we completed the financing related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. This included a $1.3 billion debt issuance, of which $350 million replaced debt that matured during the quarter, and a $288 million mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, our first quarter 2018 results and full year 2018 outlook do not include any contributions from The Warranty Group nor the impact of the $1.2 billion of acquisition-related financing. 
Prior to closing, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share will exclude the interest expense and dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition financing. These amounts, however, will be reflected in our GAAP results. Once the transaction closes, we will include the related interest expense and dilutive impact of the shares in operating results using the if-converted accounting methodology. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings increase as well as modest underlying business growth. This growth was partially offset by increased corporate expenses and higher catastrophe losses. 
We also continue to make good progress preparing for the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition. This included submitting the required filings and raising the necessary funds to support the acquisition. Integration planning efforts continue and position us well post-closing. Our teams have developed detailed road maps to successfully bring together our business operations within Global Lifestyle, leveraging our combined talent and product offerings worldwide. 
So far, we have received several regulatory approvals and still expect to close the transaction in the second quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory and customary closing approvals. Overall, we remain bullish on the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and also, more broadly, across our key lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Housing, our focus remains on sustaining our leadership position within lender-placed insurance. This quarter, we migrated our first significant client to our single processing platform. As this work continues, we expect to drive net savings later this year, with more expected in 2019 and beyond. This will help us maintain strong returns within lender-placed and deliver an even better customer experience. 
With over 1.8 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we extended our resident bond offering to include commercial property owners, management companies and their tenants. Now both residential and commercial property managers can offer a surety bond payment as an alternative to a security deposit. This increases protection, while also reducing the tenant's upfront move-in cost. 
As we look to further expand our presence in the rental economy, we recently launched a partnership with ApartmentJet to provide multifamily housing owners an insurance solution that covers both nightly and extended-stay guests. 
While we were pleased with the performance and growth momentum within multifamily housing, mortgage solutions results remained disappointing. Ongoing weak client demand and soft market conditions, especially in new loan originations and field services, continue to pressure results in the first quarter. We expect this environment will remain challenging for the rest of the year. 
While mortgage solutions is not a significant portion of the segment's results, we are continuing to aggressively take actions to improve performance. This includes continuing to manage expenses, while actively pursuing new business opportunities. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle, we continue to expand our mobile business, now protecting 38 million devices worldwide. The significant portion of that increase is coming from our continued success with KDDI, the second-largest carrier in Japan. Since year-end, enrollments in that program nearly doubled. We expect to continue to strengthen our mobile business in the region building on our recent accomplishments in Japan, South Korea and Australia, and also leveraging The Warranty Group's existing footprint in Asia. 
While first quarter results in the vehicle business were lower, we saw sustained double-digit revenue growth from strong prior period sales from third-party administrators, recreational vehicle distributors and our partnerships with leading OEMs. We now protect 15 million vehicles. Along with The Warranty Group, we believe we can further extend our leadership position and capitalize on emerging growth trends over time. 
We also continue to make select investments in the Connected Living market. During the quarter, this included strengthening our connected home capabilities through an investment in a company which specializes in home installation and technical support services. We also made a modest investment in an Asia Pacific trade-in and device disposition provider as we reinforced our presence in that region. 
Overall, we believe our efforts to maintain growth momentum and to drive margin improvement across our portfolio positions us well to deliver profitable growth in 2018. 
Turning to our financial results, we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. These metrics exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of TWG and our recently completed acquisition financing. 
For the first quarter, Assurant's net operating income increased by 8% to $115 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying growth in the business, offset mainly by higher corporate expenses. Operating earnings per diluted share was $2.14, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting both growth in earnings and 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.2%, up 40 basis points since year-end. 
For full year 2018, we continue to expect Assurant's standalone net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 10% to 14% from 2017 reported results of $413 million. This reflects a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying segment earnings growth. 
Expansion within our Connected Living, multifamily housing and vehicle protection businesses are expected to offset ongoing declines in lender-placed and credit insurance. 
As we previously communicated, we'll be redeploying a portion of the tax savings to support growth long term, with investments accelerating later this year. As always, we will continue to focus on actively reducing expenses to expand margins over time. 
For 2018, we also continue to expect net operating income per diluted share to grow in excess of net operating income, benefiting from 2017 share repurchase activity. This outlook does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing. We will update our outlook for the year to include TWG, sometime in the third quarter. 
In regard to our longer-term financial metrics and targets, we plan to refresh those to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations at a later date. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our first quarter 2018 results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,558647963,1452078,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 04, 2018",2018-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of addi",1678,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. 
Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additional income. Results also reflected $8 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the severe winter storms in the Northeast. 
Excluding both the reportable catastrophes and the impact of tax reform, underlying earnings increased slightly. Higher contributions from international housing products, growth in multifamily housing and modest income from processing the residual flood claims from Hurricane Harvey were the key drivers. The increase was partially offset by ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses increased to 85.3% from 82.9% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher reportable catastrophes noted earlier. Excluding cats, the risk-based combined ratio was roughly flat. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 11.4% from 8.8% in the first quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the first quarter. Lower placement rates and reductions in real estate owned volumes in lender-placed drove the decline. Fee income was impacted by a decrease in mortgage solutions, as Alan mentioned earlier. 
The placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall improvement in the housing market and the higher mix of low placement loans. 
For the rest of the year, we expect ongoing declines in the placement rate, averaging 4 to 5 basis points per quarter, assuming continued growth in the housing market. The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by continued growth, mainly from affinity partners in multifamily housing. 
For 2018, we continue to expect Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. A portion of tax savings is expected to be reinvested into the segment for future growth later this year. 
Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should be lower as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and mortgage solution declines. Continued profitable growth in multifamily housing, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships, as well as increased product penetration, will help to mitigate the decrease. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, this segment reported earnings of $56 million for the first quarter compared to $52 million in the prior period of last year. The first quarter of 2017 included $7.5 million of onetime client recoverables. Excluding this disclosed item and the $7 million benefit from tax reform, net operating income increased $4 million. 
Underlying results benefited from mobile growth within Connected Living, which was largely attributable to the new mobile programs implemented last year as well as growth from existing clients. We also recorded a benefit related to the revised client contract terms. While this is part of our normal course of business operations, the benefit was higher-than-anticipated and is not expected to recur in the second quarter. Results were partially offset by less favorable vehicle protection results and lower earnings from our U.S. credit business.
Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up 14% in the quarter. Contributions from new mobile programs, including subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection, were partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in volumes. 
Looking at this segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses increased to 99.1% from 92.2%. This was mainly due to less favorable results in the vehicle protection business, including elevated expenses and higher loss experience compared to a favorable prior period. 
As a reminder, the prior year period also included $4.3 million pretax benefit from a onetime client recoverable in the credit business. Excluding this benefit, the combined ratio increased 5.6 points due to the factors noted earlier. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 8.2% in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the prior year period. Excluding the $6.7 million of client recoverables from last year, the margin expanded 2.3 points, driven by profitable growth in new and existing programs. Overall, lower margins on trade-in activity partially offset this increase.
We are pleased with Lifestyle's first quarter results. For the full year, we still believe net operating income growth will be modest before taking into account tax reform. Mobile will remain a significant contributor, driven by growth from programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion of our offerings with existing clients. In addition, as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate depending on the success of new phone introductions and mobile carrier promotional activity. 
Despite a softer first quarter for the vehicle business, we continue to expect profitable growth for 2018 as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn. Contributions from credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.
As always, across our business, we will continue to manage expenses. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate, now expected to be roughly 22% to 24%, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be even higher in 2018. While a portion of tax savings are expected to be reinvested into the business for future growth, we anticipate the investments to occur during the latter part of the year. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $10 million in the first quarter net operating income, consistent with the prior year period. Excluding the $2 million benefit from the lower tax rate, earnings were down. This was primarily related to higher IT expenses as we transitioned to a new operating platform. 
Despite the harsh flu season this year, mortality was only slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was also seasonally high. Revenue in Preneed was up 5%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S, including sales of our Final Preneed product in prior periods. Base sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower Final Need sales as we shift the focus to higher-return multipay products. 
In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of approximately 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested into the business later in 2018. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million, a year-over-year increase of $10 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses compared to a favorable prior period and a $2 million adverse effect from the lower tax rate. 
For 2018, we continue to expect the full year Corporate net operating loss to be approximately at level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million. 
Turning to capital, excluding the $1.2 billion of financing proceeds related to The Warranty Group acquisition, we ended March with $575 million in total company capital or about $325 million of deployable capital, after adjusting for our risk buffer. 
Dividends in the quarter from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $182 million, which included $140 million of capital related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, following tax reform. This increased our dividend capacity, providing more cash to the holding company and allowed us to lower the amount of equity issued as part of our TWG financing, effectively bringing forward the share repurchases originally planned for later this year. As a result, we did not purchase any shares in the quarter. 
In terms of uses of cash, we did, however, pay $30 million in shareholder dividends and paid $42 million worth of final claims reserve settlement associated with the 2015 sale of our general agency business. This settlement payment was previously accrued for, and therefore, had no material impact to our income statement. 
And finally, we invested $8 million towards strengthening our connected home and asset disposition capabilities, as Alan mentioned earlier.
In 2018, we now expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings because of the increased dividends made available following the reduction in our deferred tax liability. Dividends from the underlying businesses are expected to approximate segment earnings. 
Overall, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the growth of the businesses. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and support The Warranty Group integration. We continue to believe share buyback activity will be unlikely for the balance of the year, but we will revisit, post close. 
As noted earlier, following the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition, we will update our presentation and results and outlook for the full year. Among other things, post-closing, our net operating income will include The Warranty Group results and approximately $36 million after tax of additional annual interest expense related to the acquisition debt financing. This also accounts for the amortization of gains from derivative transactions that were used to hedge interest rate risk. 
And for the purposes of net operating income per diluted share, results will reflect the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted accounting basis. Prior to closing, however, the impact of the $1.2 billion acquisition financing will only impact GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share. 
In the next few weeks, we expect to file a summary of TWG's first quarter results. At this stage in their post process, we believe the business performance continues to track against our expectations and reflects ongoing momentum in their vehicle business. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

And then we have opportunities to manage that equity and to go through combined operations and release some capital out of our businesses.

But we feel like we've taken appropriate actions to really stabilize that business."

But the way to think about this is before the crisis, if you go back to the '05, '06 type range, we had placement rates, call it, 1.5%, a little bit around that range, and that was largely from voluntary purchase by consumers. And that was in an era when our rates were substantially higher than voluntary products. You fast forward to today, we've completely redone the product over the last 5 years. Our product is actually relatively competitive now with the existing voluntary products. And so what we're finding now is we're having greater consumer choice to pick our product, and then there's always going to be some level of volume that comes from the foreclosed inventory, the seriously delinquent, that's move into foreclosure, that's moved into REO. Which is why we feel pretty well positioned that even the placement rate was going to continue to modulate a little bit, which it could if the housing market was very strong, we're not far from the bottom at this point.

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. 
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. On May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. 
As of June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results and the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March as well as related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock are also an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. For the period between March and closing, these financing costs were reflected only in our GAAP net income and, therefore, not part of net operating income. 
In addition, last week, we close the sale of our mortgage solutions business. While our second quarter 2018 results include the operating results in mortgage solutions, given the disposition, the associated assets and liabilities were held for sale with the resulting net loss of $34 million reflected in consolidated net income. 
Starting August 1, mortgage solutions results will no longer be included in operating results. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. 
Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Initial contributions from The Warranty Group acquisition as well as the benefit from the lower effective U.S. tax rate. 
In May, we close the acquisition of TWG and welcomed nearly 1,500 new colleagues to Assurant. Our global planning efforts during the months leading up to the close allowed us to hit the ground running on day 1. 
Relying on our principal of best of the best, we are now bringing together our organizations, leveraging the deep talent, processes and technology across our combined companies. Conversations with our clients also continue and feedback remains favorable. 
To capitalize on growth opportunities and emerging market trends, we've rebranded our vehicle business, now known as Global Automotive, under new leadership. 
We have dedicated a leadership for each of our primary auto distribution channels as well as deeper expertise to drive innovation as we look to deliver new offerings to clients and consumers worldwide. 
We've also integrated TWG's extended service contract business within Connected Living with a growing focus of building our capabilities around the connected home. And we've realigned our legacy credit business, now named financial services, to pursue emerging opportunities in the banking sector. 
Globally, the acquisition meaningfully expands our business outside the U.S., increasing our total international annual revenues by 50%. We've also added infrastructure across Asia Pacific, where we see some of our greatest opportunities, particularly around mobile. 
We have refined our view of operating synergies and are starting to realize these benefits. In addition, our business leaders are now pursuing potential revenue synergies, which provide upside to our original acquisition thesis. 
Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and more broadly, across our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me share some of the highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted very strong results for the quarter. While this included some onetime benefits, they illustrate momentum across Connected Living and Global Automotive. 
Our recently launched mobile programs continue to strive from strong market success, particularly in Japan, which is the second largest postpaid mobile device market. 
We now protect 44 million covered mobile devices worldwide and in Global Automotive, we are the market leader protecting nearly 47 million vehicles. 
Overall, we see significant opportunity to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connected lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing, the segment also posted solid results, driven by multi-family housing earnings and revenue growth and favorable loss experience in lender-placed. 
During the quarter, we finalized our $1.3 billion reinsurance program for 2018. We now protect more than 2.9 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. 
This coverage represents a projected profitable maximum loss of a roughly 1 in 170-year event storm. So the likelihood of us exceeding total coverage for 1 single event is significantly less than 1%. 
At the same time, we were able to lower our net loss prevent retention to $120 million as we continue to decrease the potential earnings volatility from cat losses. 
As part of our June announcement, we also shared several new metrics to further illustrate the strength of our program, including a review of historical losses and examples for how the 2018 program would work under various storm scenarios. 
We believe our continued commitment to excellence in risk management will again serve us well as we move through hurricane season. 
As exemplified by our cat program, protecting and serving our policyholders is core to what we do each and every day. We were pleased to be recognized by 2 of our key lender-placed clients as one of their best vendors for delivering a superior customer experience. 
We also believe that in order to sustain this advantage, we must continue to invest, including in an ongoing enhancements to our processes and systems. 
Our work on our single-processing platform continues, and we expect to migrate another important client in the coming months. This new platform will generate significant cost savings and help deliver a better customer experience. 
With nearly 1.9 million insured renters, our multi-family housing business continues to generate both strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we rolled out additional enhancements to our renters platform, which makes it easier to engage with our property management companies and their renters. 
This is yet another example of how we were investing to improve our customer experience and sustain our market-leading position. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we conducted a comprehensive strategic and financial assessment in mortgage solutions and decided to sell this business. 
One of the key criteria we use to evaluate our businesses is the ability to be market leaders. Despite some initial success, we did not see a long-term path to a leadership position for mortgage solutions. 
Last week, we closed on the sale to Xome Holdings for $35 million in cash with potential future payments based on performance. We believe Xome will be a better owner of this business, given its focus and committed resources in the space. 
The sale will allow us to concentrate on our core housing business as well as deploy greater resources to build out offerings in areas, such as the rental economy and the connected home. 
I'd like to thank the mortgage solutions team for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our clients, and I wish them the best as part of Xome. 
Turning to our financial results. We currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all, excluding catastrophe losses. 
Beginning in June, these metrics now include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first 6 months of the year, Assurant's net operating income increased by $39 million or 20% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by strong organic growth in the business, a lower effective tax rate and initial contributions from TWG. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $4.24, up 21%, largely driven by earnings growth as well as 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end. 
At the end of June, holding company capital totaled $497 million after returning a total of $36 million in common and preferred dividends. In July, we resumed share repurchase activity given a stronger cash balance following the closing of the acquisition. 
As always, we are committed to managing our capital prudently and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Turning to our full year 2018 outlook, we've updated it to reflect the acquisition of TWG and the August 1st sale of mortgage solutions. We now expect Assurant net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 20% to 25% from last year. This reflects contributions from TWG, included expected operating synergies, the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate and modest organic growth across our company. 
We also expect strong growth in net operating income per diluted share this year, however, at a slower rate than net operating income. This is mainly due to the effect of the TWG-related share issuance without a full run rate contribution of TWG income and synergies. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long-term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. 
This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long-term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter 2018 results and updated segment outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,573687132,1525949,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2018",2018-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing, where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 millio",1906,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing, where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. 
The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million of the increase, as only a small amount of the tax savings was reinvested into the business in the quarter. The balance of the increase was due to more favorable noncatastrophe loss experience in lender-placed insurance and growth in multi-family housing. 
This was partially offset by ongoing declines in lender-placed, reflecting the strength of the housing market. 
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses improved to 85.7% from 87% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to more favorable noncat loss experience compared to a very active hail and wind season last year. Results also benefited from lower expenses. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 14.3% from 11.7% in the second quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multi-family housing as well as expense reductions. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the second quarter. Given the strength of the overall market, we continue to see reductions in real estate owned volumes and lower placement rates in lender-placed. 
Fee income was impacted by lower client demand in mortgage solutions, primarily in field services and valuations. The placement rate, so lender-placed dropped 21 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low-placement loans. 
We continue to expect ongoing declines in the placement rate for the balance of 2018, eventually beginning to moderate as we exit the year. 
Multi-family housing continued to grow, mainly from affinity partners and expansion of our international and other housing products. As noted earlier, while second quarter operating results for Global Housing still includes mortgage solutions, the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as of June 30, given the plan to sell the business. 
This resulted in an impairment loss of $34 million, reflected in our consolidated net income. The impact of the final purchase price and any other adjustments as part of the loss on sale of the subsidiary will be recorded in our third quarter financials. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $68 million for the second quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year period. This included a $5 million benefit from a lower effective tax rate following the passage of U.S. tax reform. 
In addition, TWG contributed $9.4 million after tax, inclusive of $1 million of realized operating synergies and $1 million of intangible amortization for the month of June. 
Excluding tax reform and the acquisition, results benefited from the ramp up of the mobile programs launched last year as well as favorable loss experienced in Global Automotive. 
We also recorded nearly $6 million of onetime contributions in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur. This encompasses $4 million related to a onetime tax benefit and $2 million from the Global Automotive business. Continued declines in financial services partially offset that increase. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up 32% or $266 million in the quarter. TWG accounted for $203 million of this increase. Looking more closely at the TWG contribution by line of business, approximately 70% of revenues is included in Global Automotive with 28% in Connected Living and the remainder in Financial Services. 
Organic growth was driven by new mobile programs, including an increase in subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection offerings. This was partially offset by lower average selling prices for mobile trade-in activity. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved slightly to 96.6%. Excluding the acquisition, the ratio was unchanged. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 7.1% in the second quarter or 7.6%, excluding TWG. 
This compares to 6.4% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by mobile programs starting in 2017 in both Asia and the U.S. The Connected Living margin reflected the legacy TWG mix of business, mainly more sensitive -- more service contracts offerings. 
We would expect this to lower our reported Connected Living margin in the next few quarters. 
Overall, we're very pleased by lifestyle's results for the first half of the year, which exceeded our expectations. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $15 million in net operating income for the quarter, up $2 million year-over-year. This was exclusively due to lower tax rate. Only a modest amount of tax savings was reinvested back into the business in the quarter. 
Revenue in preneed for the quarter was flat, both in the U.S., including prior period sales and the final need product, was offset by lower production in Canada compared to a favorable second quarter 2017. We are encouraged, however, by 8% growth in face sales after several periods of decline. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $17 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses and additional technology investments as well as a $2 million adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to capital, we ended June with $497 million in holding company capital or about $247 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer. 
Dividends from the business totaled $296 million, which included $284 million of dividends from Global Housing, lifestyle and preneed. $86 million from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities following tax reform was a key driver. 
In addition, $12 million of residual capital supporting our former benefits and Health businesses contributed to the total. Overall, dividends as a percent of segment earnings year-to-date were at a higher level relative to our typical seasonal pattern as we prepared for the TWG closing in the quarter. 
Looking at outflows, we paid $36 million in shareholder dividends, $31 million for common stock and $5 million for our preferred stock. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. 
This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction in our deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG equal to their 12-month earnings. 
In other words, legacy Assurant dividends are still expected to equal segment earnings. 
As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as profitable growth in the businesses. 
And we resumed our share repurchase program in July. This reflected our view of the stock as well as the higher level of deployable capital at the holding company, following the acquisition close. 
Through August 3, we have bought back 319,000 shares for approximately $34 million. We believe our capital position will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, support The Warranty Group integration and return capital to shareholders in 2018 and beyond. 
As Alan previewed, we also update our full year outlook for our segments to take into account TWG. Overall, we expect net operating income, including catastrophe losses, to increase 20% to 25% from $413 million in 2017. The lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24% will be a key driver of that with roughly 1/3 of savings being reinvested back into the business. 
We've already committed the majority of the spend in the second half of 2018 to our technology and capability enhancements, originally planned for next year. 
Another important driver of that earnings increase will be the contributions from TWG, along with organic growth in the business. More specifically, for the full year, Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, should increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should decline year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. This will be partially offset by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased penetration rates in our multi-family housing business. 
As a reminder, late last year, we benefited from unusually low noncat loss experience and additional income from processing a significant value club claims relating to Hurricane Harvey. We are not expecting either of this to reoccur in the second half of 2018. 
Earnings growth in Global Lifestyle will reflect the combination of organic growth and the TWG acquisition, along with the benefit of lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth will be driven by mobile and auto, partially offset by declines in financial services, mainly from runoff and discontinued partnerships as we move to the third quarter. Foreign exchange could also be a factor. 
Looking at Connected Living. Mobile increases will be driven by programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion from our offerings with existing clients. 
But as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate, depending on the success of new phone introductions, availability of those phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. We expect continued growth in our Global Automotive business, as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn, along with the contributions from TWG. 
This also includes synergies realized as we combine our operations and streamline our infrastructure. Based on our current plans, we expect to realize approximately $13 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in synergies this year. 
On a run-rate basis, this represents roughly half of our commitment to realize $60 million of pretax operating synergies by the end of 2019. We anticipate the majority of those synergies will be reflected in lifestyle's results with some flowing through Corporate as we align our shared service functions. 
At Global Preneed, we anticipate earnings will continue to increase modestly before the impact of tax, driven by expansion of new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. 
And finally, Corporate nonoperating loss is now expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. This reflects the adverse impact of a lower tax rate at roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, along with the additional net expenses associated with TWG. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
In addition, we expect our annual interest expense increased to roughly $65 million after-tax for 2018, including the debt incurred to finance the TWG acquisition. Net operating income will also include around $11 million after-tax for the payment of our preferred dividends. 
Before moving into a Q&A, I want to highlight certain key initial purchase accounting items related to TWG. As of June 30, we recorded $1.5 billion in goodwill and approximately $450 million in other intangible assets. 
These other intangible assets will be amortized over periods of up to 15 years based on the economic benefit achieved and, therefore, will not be linear. 
For 2018, we expect the pretax net impact of the purchase account adjustments in Global Lifestyle to be around $7 million, of which $1 million was expensed in June. 
Based on current estimates, we expect that amount to increase in 2019 to $18 million pretax for the full year and $27 million in 2020 as the business previously written begins to earn. 
This will eventually reach $30 million to $35 million pretax by year 5. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We're now 2 months postclosing, and we're really 9 months postplanning for the deal. After we announced that we are fortunate in some ways to have a 7-month period. And so we had really good line of sight developed to the hard cost operating synergies, and we feel like that's going very well. Two months in, we are, run rate about halfway to our $60 million of pretax public commitment. And now that we own the company, we are beginning to aggressively go after revenue synergies, leveraging their infrastructure in certain markets that bring our products into this markets and similarly, the other way around. We also have a significant opportunity in front of us in claims cost, where with our combined scale and now, having 47 million vehicles that we manage globally, both the revenue and the claims costs were not in our deal model. In terms of the accretion, what we've said is when we announced the deal, it would be modestly accretive. We're certainly still on track for that and at the right point in time, once we have the run rate synergies, we'll come back to that.

Think of that as hard cost savings and what we've said now is we have good line of sight to that, and we're already halfway there on a run-rate basis 2 months. And so we feel good about that. The other 2 I mentioned, were revenue synergies, where TWG, for example, have infrastructure in a country but doesn't necessarily have access to clients. We have the client relationships but don't have that particular capability. We have a long list of specific opportunities that are in development with clients right now. Now most of those won't hit 2018. Those will be things that would begin to benefit in 2019 and 2020, but they're not in the deal model. We assumed 0 in the deal model. The other one I mentioned, is just claims cost around autos. If you think about controlling now 47 million vehicle contracts globally and growing, we are one of the largest single distributors of repairs in the market. And how do we then leverage our scale, contracts, get better pricing? That's a significant upside over time for us as well. Again, the deal model assumes 0 for that."

One example is electric. And obviously, it's early days still for the adoption of electric cars. But if you think about an electric car from a consumer point of view, there's less that can go wrong, but when it goes wrong, it's really expensive. Our hypothesis to be proven is that, that will drive up attachment over time of service contracts. And that's a significant opportunity and one of the reasons why we're really intrigued by The Warranty Group. They're doing this heavily markets like China that are ahead of the U.S. in kind of electric car technology today. Another major trend is autonomous vehicles and ridesharing and again, that creates real opportunities. Cars may be owned differently and that may change but every time there's an owner, there's an opportunity when that car sells to attach a service contract. So in the short-term, we haven't seen a lot of changes in attachment rate across the vehicle business. But longer-term, we feel extremely well positioned compared to competitors to respond to some of these real long-term changes in the way cars are going to be owned and operated."

And opportunities process consumers hold the phone longer, with what we've done in some of the markets, we're now doing effectively extended warranties on phones, which go beyond the underlying manufacturer warranty.

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. 
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. On May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. 
As of June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results and the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March as well as related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock are also an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. For the period between March and closing, these financing costs were reflected only in our GAAP net income and therefore, not part of net operating income. 
In addition, last week, we closed the sale of our mortgage solutions business. While our second quarter 2018 results include the operating results in mortgage solutions, given the disposition, the associated assets and liabilities were held for sale with the resulting net loss of $34 million reflected in consolidated net income. Starting August 1, mortgage solutions results will no longer be included in operating results. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle.

Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Initial contributions from The Warranty Group acquisition as well as the benefit from the lower effective U.S. tax rate. 
In May, we closed the acquisition of TWG and welcomed nearly 1,500 new colleagues to Assurant. Our global planning efforts during the months leading up to the close allowed us to hit the ground running on day 1... Relying on our principal of best of the best, we are now bringing together our organizations, leveraging the deep talent, processes and technology across our combined companies. Conversations with our clients also continue and feedback remains favorable. 
To capitalize on growth opportunities and emerging market trends, we've rebranded our vehicle business, now known as Global Automotive, under new leadership. We have dedicated leadership for each of our primary auto distribution channels as well as deeper expertise to drive innovation as we look to deliver new offerings to clients and consumers worldwide. 
We've also integrated TWG's extended service contract business within Connected Living with the growing focus of building our capabilities around the connected home. And we've realigned our legacy credit business, now named Financial Services, to pursue emerging opportunities in the banking sector. 
Globally, the acquisition meaningfully expands our business outside the U.S., increasing our total international annual revenues by 50%. We've also added infrastructure across Asia Pacific where we see some of our greatest opportunities, particularly around mobile. We have refined our view of operating synergies and are starting to realize these benefits. In addition, our business leaders are now pursuing potential revenue synergies, which provide upside to our original acquisition thesis. 
Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and more broadly, across our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me share some of the highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted very strong results for the quarter. While this included some onetime benefits, they illustrate momentum across Connected Living and Global Automotive. 
Our recently launched mobile programs continued to thrive from strong market success, particularly in Japan, which is the second largest postpaid mobile device market. We now protect 44 million covered mobile devices worldwide, and in Global Automotive, we are the market leader protecting nearly 47 million vehicles. 
Overall, we see significant opportunity to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing. The segment also posted solid results, driven by multifamily housing earnings and revenue growth and favorable loss experience in lender-placed. 
During the quarter, we finalized our $1.3 billion reinsurance program for 2018. We now protect more than 2.9 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. This coverage represents a projected profitable maximum loss of a roughly 1 in 170-year event storm. So the likelihood of us exceeding the total coverage for 1 single event is significantly less than 1%. At the same time, we were able to lower our net loss prevent retention to $120 million as we continue to decrease the potential earnings volatility from cat losses. 
As part of our June announcement, we also shared several new metrics to further illustrate the strength of our program, including a review of historical losses and examples for how the 2018 program would work under various storm scenarios. We believe our continued commitment to excellence in risk management will again serve us well as we move through hurricane season. 
As exemplified by our cat program, protecting and servicing our policyholders is core to what we do each and every day. We were pleased to be recognized by 2 of our key lender-placed clients as one of their best vendors for delivering a superior customer experience. We also believe that in order to sustain this advantage, we must continue to invest, including in an ongoing enhancements to our processes and systems. Our work on our single-processing platform continues, and we expect to migrate another important client in the coming months. This new platform will generate significant cost savings and help deliver a better customer experience. 
With nearly 1.9 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate both strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we rolled out additional enhancements to our renters platform, which makes it easier to engage with our property management companies and their renters. This is yet another example of how we were investing to improve our customer experience and sustain our market-leading position. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we conducted a comprehensive strategic and financial assessment in mortgage solutions and decided to sell this business. One of the key criteria we used to evaluate our businesses is the ability to be market leaders. Despite some initial success, we did not see a long-term path to a leadership position for mortgage solutions. 
Last week, we closed on the sale to Xome Holdings for $35 million in cash with potential future payments based on performance. We believe Xome will be a better owner of this business, given its focus and committed resources in the space. The sale will allow us to concentrate on our core housing business as well as deploy greater resources to build out offerings in areas, such as the rental economy and the connected home. I'd like to thank the mortgage solutions team for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our clients, and I wish them the best as part of Xome. 
Turning to our financial results. We currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. Beginning in June, these metrics now include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. 
For the first 6 months of the year, Assurant's net operating income increased by $39 million or 20% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by strong organic growth in the business, a lower effective tax rate and initial contributions from TWG. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $4.24, up 21%, largely driven by earnings growth as well as 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end. 
At the end of June, holding company capital totaled $497 million after returning a total of $36 million in common and preferred dividends. In July, we resumed share repurchase activity given the stronger cash balance following the closing of the acquisition. As always, we are committed to managing our capital prudently and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Turning to our full year 2018 outlook, we've updated it to reflect the acquisition of TWG and the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. We now expect Assurant net operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophes to increase 20% to 25% from last year. This reflects contributions from TWG, included expected operating synergies, the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate and modest organic growth across our company. 
We also expect strong growth in net operating income per diluted share this year, however, at a slower rate than net operating income. This is mainly due to the effect of the TWG-related share issuance without a full run rate contribution of TWG income and synergies. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter 2018 results and updated segment outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,573687132,1526203,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2018",2018-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million o",1907,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million of the increase, as only a small amount of the tax savings was reinvested into the business in the quarter. The balance of the increase was due to more favorable noncatastrophe loss experience in lender-placed insurance and growth in multifamily housing. This was partially offset by ongoing declines in lender-placed, reflecting the strength of the housing market. 
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses improved to 85.7% from 87% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to more favorable noncat loss experience compared to a very active hail and wind season last year. Results also benefited from lower expenses. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 14.3% from 11.7% in the second quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing as well as expense reductions. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the second quarter. Given the strength of the overall market, we continued to see reductions in real estate on volumes and lower placement rates in lender-placed. Fee income was impacted by lower client demand in mortgage solutions, primarily in field services and valuations. 
The placement rate, so lender-placed dropped 21 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low-placement loans. We continue to expect ongoing declines in the placement rate for the balance of 2018, eventually beginning to moderate as we exit the year. 
Multifamily housing continued to grow, mainly from affinity partners and expansion of our international and other housing products. As noted earlier, while second quarter operating results for Global Housing still includes mortgage solutions, the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as of June 30, given the plan to sell the business. This resulted in an impairment loss of $34 million, reflected in our consolidated net income. The impact of the final purchase price and any other adjustments as part of the loss on sale of the subsidiary will be recorded in our third quarter financials. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $68 million for the second quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year period. This included a $5 million benefit from a lower effective tax rate following the passage of U.S. tax reform. In addition, TWG contributed $9.4 million after tax, inclusive of $1 million of realized operating synergies and $1 million of intangible amortization for the month of June. 
Excluding tax reform and the acquisition, results benefited from the ramp-up of the mobile programs launched last year as well as favorable loss experience in Global Automotive. We also recorded nearly $6 million of onetime contributions in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur. This encompasses $4 million related to a onetime tax benefit and $2 million from the Global Automotive business. Continued declines in Financial Services partially offset that increase. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up 32% or $266 million in the quarter. TWG accounted for $203 million of this increase. Looking more closely at the TWG contribution by line of business, approximately 70% of revenues is included in Global Automotive with 28% in Connected Living and the remainder in Financial Services. 
Organic growth was driven by new mobile programs, including an increase in subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection offerings. This was partially offset by lower average selling prices for mobile trade-in activity. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved slightly to 96.6%. Excluding the acquisition, the ratio was unchanged. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 7.1% in the second quarter or 7.6% excluding TWG. This compares to 6.4% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by mobile programs starting 2017 in both Asia and the U.S. The Connected Living margin reflected the legacy TWG mix of business, mainly more sensitive -- more service contracts offerings. We would expect this to lower our reported Connected Living margin in the next few quarters. Overall, we're very pleased by Lifestyle's results for the first half of the year, which exceeded our expectations. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $15 million in net operating income for the quarter, up $2 million year-over-year. This was exclusively due to lower tax rate. Only a modest amount of tax savings was reinvested back into the business in the quarter. 
Revenue in Preneed for the quarter was flat, both in the U.S., including prior period sales and the Final Need product, was offset by lower production in Canada compared to a favorable second quarter 2017. We are encouraged, however, by 8% growth in face sales after several periods of decline. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $17 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses and additional technology investments as well as a $2 million adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to capital, we ended June with $497 million in holding company capital or about $247 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends from the business totaled $296 million, which included $284 million of dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed. The $86 million from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities following tax reform was a key driver. In addition, $12 million of residual capital supporting our former benefits in health businesses contributed to the total. Overall, dividends as a percent of segment earnings year-to-date were at a higher level relative to our typical seasonal pattern as we prepared for the TWG closing in the quarter. 
Looking at outflows, we paid $36 million in shareholder dividends, $31 million for common stock and $5 million for our preferred stock. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction in our deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG equal to their 12-month earnings. In other words, legacy Assurant dividends are still expected to equal segment earnings. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as profitable growth in the businesses. And we resumed our share repurchase program in July. This reflected our view of the stock as well as the higher level of deployable capital at the holding company following the acquisition close. Through August 3, we have bought back 319,000 shares for approximately $34 million. We believe our capital position will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, support The Warranty Group integration and return capital to shareholders in 2018 and beyond. 
As Alan previewed, we also update our full year outlook for our segments to take into account TWG. Overall, we expect net operating income excluding catastrophe losses to increase 20% to 25% from $413 million in 2017. The lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24% will be a key driver of that with roughly 1/3 of savings being reinvested back into the business. We've already committed the majority of the spend in the second half of 2018 to our technology and capability enhancements, originally planned for next year. 
Another important driver of that earnings increase will be the contributions from TWG, along with organic growth in the business. More specifically, for the full year, Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, should increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should decline year-over-year, primarily as a result to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. This will be partially offset by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased penetration rates in our multifamily housing business. 
As a reminder, late last year, we benefited from unusually low noncat loss experience and additional income from processing a significant value of club claims related to Hurricane Harvey. We are not expecting either of this to reoccur in the second half of 2018. 
Earnings growth in Global Lifestyle will reflect the combination of organic growth and the TWG acquisition, along with the benefit of lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth will be driven by mobile and auto, partially offset by declines in Financial Services, mainly from runoff and discontinued partnerships as we move into the third quarter. Foreign exchange could also be a factor. 
Looking at Connected Living. Mobile increases will be driven by programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion from our offerings with existing clients. But as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate, depending on the success of new phone introductions, availability of those phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. We expect continued growth in our Global Automotive business as strong sales from prior periods continued to earn, along with the contributions from TWG. This also includes synergies realized as we combine our operations and streamline our infrastructure. Based on our current plans, we expect to realize approximately $13 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in synergies this year. 
On a run-rate basis, this represents roughly half of our commitment to realize $60 million of pretax operating synergies by the end of 2019. We anticipate the majority of those synergies will be reflected in Lifestyle's results with some flowing through Corporate as we align our shared service functions. 
At Global Preneed, we anticipate earnings will continue to increase modestly before the impact of tax, driven by the expansion of new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. 
And finally, Corporate nonoperating loss is now expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. This reflects the adverse impact of a lower tax rate at roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, along with the additional net expenses associated with TWG. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
In addition, we expect our annual interest expense to increase to roughly $65 million after-tax for 2018, including the debt incurred to finance the TWG acquisition. Net operating income will also include around $11 million after-tax for the payment of our preferred dividends. 
Before moving into Q&A, I want to highlight certain key initial purchase accounting items related to TWG. As of June 30, we recorded $1.5 billion in goodwill and approximately $450 million in other intangible assets. These other intangible assets will be amortized over periods of up to 15 years based on the economic benefit achieved and, therefore, will not be linear. For 2018, we expect the pretax net impact of the purchase accounting adjustments in Global Lifestyle to be around $7 million, of which $1 million was expensed in June. Based on current estimates, we expect that amount to increase in 2019 to $18 million pretax for the full year and $27 million in 2020 as the business previously written begins to earn. This will eventually reach $30 million to $35 million pretax by year 5. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We're now 2 months post-closing, and we're really 9 months post-planning for the deal after we announced that we were fortunate in some ways to have a 7-month period. And so we had a really good line of sight developed to the hard cost operating synergies, and we feel like that's going very well. Two months in, we -- our run rate, about halfway to our $60 million pretax public commitment. And now that we own the company, we are beginning to aggressively go after revenue synergies, leveraging their infrastructure in certain markets that bring our products into those markets and similarly the other way around. We also have a significant opportunity in front of us in claims cost where, with our combined scale, we're now having 47 million vehicles that we manage globally. Both the revenue and the claims costs were not in our deal model. In terms of the accretion, what we've said is, when we announced the deal, it would be modestly accretive. We're certainly still on track for that, and at the right point in time, once we have the run rate synergies, we'll come back to that.

It's just an alternative for the consumer. So the gradual decline in placement rates is really driven by the housing cycle of it.

One example is electric, and obviously it's early days still for the adoption of electric cars. But if you think about an electric car from a consumer point of view, there's less that can go wrong, but when it goes wrong, it's really expensive. Our hypothesis to be proven is that, that will drive up attachment over time of service contracts. That's a significant opportunity. And one of the reasons why we're really intrigued by The Warranty Group, they're doing this heavily end markets like China that are ahead of the U.S. in kind of electric car technology today. Another major trend is autonomous vehicles and ridesharing, and again, that creates real opportunities. Cars may be owned differently, and that could change. But every time there's an owner, there's an opportunity when that car sells to attach a service contract. So in the short term, we haven't seen a lot of changes in attachment rate across the vehicle business. But longer term, we feel extremely well positioned compared to competitors to respond to some of these real long-term changes in the way cars are going to be owned and operated."

You saw in the quarter, we added not just the new contracts from The Warranty Group, but we had significant growth in mobile. The part that's been relatively flattish the last few years are device trade-in volumes. We haven't had in the last 2, third and fourth quarters, the big seasonal spike up that we used to have. But with that said, volumes are gradually rising just because the market is gradually growing. And opportunities [ growth ] is consumers hold the phone longer. With what we've done in some of the markets, we're now doing effectively extended warranties on phones, which go beyond the underlying manufacturer warranty. That's what we've always done in autos. Never been done in phones before at least by us, and it's creating a new growth opportunity for us in mobile. So no, we don't see anything that would cause us to say mobile's slowing down.

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. 
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. On May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. 
As of June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results and the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March as well as related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock are also an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. For the period between March and closing, these financing costs were reflected only in our GAAP net income and therefore, not part of net operating income. 
In addition, last week, we closed the sale of our mortgage solutions business. While our second quarter 2018 results include the operating results in mortgage solutions, given the disposition, the associated assets and liabilities were held for sale with the resulting net loss of $34 million reflected in consolidated net income. Starting August 1, mortgage solutions results will no longer be included in operating results. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Initial contributions from The Warranty Group acquisition as well as the benefit from the lower effective U.S. tax rate. 
In May, we closed the acquisition of TWG and welcomed nearly 1,500 new colleagues to Assurant. Our global planning efforts during the months leading up to the close allowed us to hit the ground running on day 1. Relying on our principal of best of the best, we are now bringing together our organizations, leveraging the deep talent, processes and technology across our combined companies. Conversations with our clients also continue and feedback remains favorable. 
To capitalize on growth opportunities and emerging market trends, we've rebranded our vehicle business, now known as Global Automotive, under new leadership. We have dedicated leadership for each of our primary auto distribution channels as well as deeper expertise to drive innovation as we look to deliver new offerings to clients and consumers worldwide. 
We've also integrated TWG's extended service contract business within Connected Living with the growing focus of building our capabilities around the connected home. And we've realigned our legacy credit business, now named Financial Services, to pursue emerging opportunities in the banking sector. 
Globally, the acquisition meaningfully expands our business outside the U.S., increasing our total international annual revenues by 50%. We've also added infrastructure across Asia Pacific where we see some of our greatest opportunities, particularly around mobile. We have refined our view of operating synergies and are starting to realize these benefits. In addition, our business leaders are now pursuing potential revenue synergies, which provide upside to our original acquisition thesis. 
Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and more broadly, across our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me share some of the highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted very strong results for the quarter. While these included some onetime benefits, they illustrate momentum across Connected Living and Global Automotive. 
Our recently launched mobile programs continue to thrive from strong market success, particularly in Japan, which is the second largest postpaid mobile device market. We now protect 44 million covered mobile devices worldwide, and in Global Automotive, we are the market leader protecting nearly 47 million vehicles. 
Overall, we see significant opportunity to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing. The segment also posted solid results, driven by multifamily housing earnings and revenue growth and favorable loss experience in lender-placed. 
During the quarter, we finalized our $1.3 billion reinsurance program for 2018. We now protect more than 2.9 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. This coverage represents a projected probably maximum loss of a roughly 1 in 170-year event storm. So the likelihood of us exceeding the total coverage for 1 single event is significantly less than 1%. At the same time, we were able to lower our net loss prevent retention to $120 million as we continue to decrease the potential earnings volatility from cat losses. 
As part of our June announcement, we also shared several new metrics to further illustrate the strength of our program, including a review of historical losses and examples for how the 2018 program would work under various storm scenarios. We believe our continued commitment to excellence in risk management will again serve us well as we move through hurricane season. 
As exemplified by our cat program, protecting and servicing our policyholders is core to what we do each and every day. We were pleased to be recognized by 2 of our key lender-placed clients as one of their best vendors for delivering a superior customer experience. We also believe that in order to sustain this advantage, we must continue to invest, including in an ongoing enhancements to our processes and systems. Our work on our single-processing platform continues, and we expect to migrate another important client in the coming months. This new platform will generate significant cost savings and help deliver a better customer experience. 
With nearly 1.9 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate both strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we rolled out additional enhancements to our renters platform, which makes it easier to engage with our property management companies and their renters. This is yet another example of how we're investing to improve our customer experience and sustain our market-leading position. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we conducted a comprehensive strategic and financial assessment in mortgage solutions and decided to sell this business. One of the key criteria we used to evaluate our businesses is the ability to be market leaders. Despite some initial success, we did not see a long-term path to a leadership position for mortgage solutions. 
Last week, we closed on the sale to Xome Holdings for $35 million in cash with potential future payments based on performance. We believe Xome will be a better owner of this business, given its focus and committed resources in the space. The sale will allow us to concentrate on our core housing business as well as deploy greater resources to build out offerings in areas, such as the rental economy and the connected home. I'd like to thank the mortgage solutions team for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our clients, and I wish them the best as part of Xome. 
Turning to our financial results. We currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. Beginning in June, these metrics now include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. 
For the first 6 months of the year, Assurant's net operating income increased by $39 million or 20% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by strong organic growth in the business, a lower effective tax rate and initial contributions from TWG. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $4.24, up 21%, largely driven by earnings growth as well as 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end. 
At the end of June, holding company capital totaled $497 million after returning a total of $36 million in common and preferred dividends. In July, we resumed share repurchase activity given the stronger cash balance following the closing of the acquisition. As always, we are committed to managing our capital prudently and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Turning to our full year 2018 outlook, we've updated it to reflect the acquisition of TWG and the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. We now expect Assurant net operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophes to increase 20% to 25% from last year. This reflects contributions from TWG, included expected operating synergies, the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate and modest organic growth across our company. 
We also expect strong growth in net operating income per diluted share this year, however, at a slower rate than net operating income. This is mainly due to the effect of the TWG-related share issuance without a full run rate contribution of TWG income and synergies. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter 2018 results and updated segment outlook in greater detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period.

Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million of the increase, as only a small amount of the tax savings was reinvested into the business in the quarter. The balance of the increase was due to more favorable noncatastrophe loss experience in lender-placed insurance and growth in multifamily housing. This was partially offset by ongoing declines in lender-placed, reflecting the strength of the housing market. 
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses improved to 85.7% from 87% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to more favorable noncat loss experience compared to a very active hail and wind season last year. Results also benefited from lower expenses. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 14.3% from 11.7% in the second quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing as well as expense reductions. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the second quarter. Given the strength of the overall market, we continued to see reductions in real estate on volumes and lower placement rates in lender-placed. Fee income was impacted by lower client demand in mortgage solutions, primarily in field services and valuations. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 21 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low-placement loans. We continue to expect ongoing declines in the placement rate for the balance of 2018, eventually beginning to moderate as we exit the year. 
Multifamily housing continued to grow, mainly from affinity partners and expansion of our international and other housing products. As noted earlier, while second quarter operating results for Global Housing still includes mortgage solutions, the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as of June 30, given the plan to sell the business. This resulted in an impairment loss of $34 million, reflected in our consolidated net income. The impact of the final purchase price and any other adjustments as part of the loss on sale of the subsidiary will be recorded in our third quarter financials. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $68 million for the second quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year period. This included a $5 million benefit from a lower effective tax rate following the passage of U.S. tax reform. In addition, TWG contributed $9.4 million after tax, inclusive of $1 million of realized operating synergies and $1 million of intangible amortization for the month of June. 
Excluding tax reform and the acquisition, results benefited from the ramp-up of the mobile programs launched last year as well as favorable loss experience in Global Automotive. We also recorded nearly $6 million of onetime contributions in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur. This encompasses $4 million related to a onetime tax benefit and $2 million from the Global Automotive business. Continued declines in Financial Services partially offset that increase. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up 32% or $266 million in the quarter. TWG accounted for $203 million of this increase. Looking more closely at the TWG contribution by line of business, approximately 70% of revenues is included in Global Automotive with 28% in Connected Living and the remainder in Financial Services. 
Organic growth was driven by new mobile programs, including an increase in subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection offerings. This was partially offset by lower average selling prices for mobile trade-in activity. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved slightly to 96.6%. Excluding the acquisition, the ratio was unchanged. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 7.1% in the second quarter or 7.6% excluding TWG. This compares to 6.4% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by mobile programs started in 2017 in both Asia and the U.S. The Connected Living margin reflected the legacy TWG mix of business, mainly more sensitive -- more service contracts offerings. We would expect this to lower our reported Connected Living margin in the next few quarters. Overall, we're very pleased by Lifestyle's results for the first half of the year, which exceeded our expectations. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $15 million in net operating income for the quarter, up $2 million year-over-year. This was exclusively due to lower tax rate. Only a modest amount of tax savings was reinvested back into the business in the quarter. 
Revenue in Preneed for the quarter was flat. Growth in the U.S., including prior period sales and the Final Need product, was offset by lower production in Canada compared to a favorable second quarter 2017. We are encouraged, however, by 8% growth in face sales after several periods of decline. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $17 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses and additional technology investments as well as a $2 million adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to capital, we ended June with $497 million in holding company capital or about $247 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends from the business totaled $296 million, which included $284 million of dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed. The $86 million from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities following tax reform was a key driver. In addition, $12 million of residual capital supporting our former benefits in health businesses contributed to the total. Overall, dividends as a percent of segment earnings year-to-date were at a higher level relative to our typical seasonal pattern as we prepared for the TWG closing in the quarter. 
Looking at outflows, we paid $36 million in shareholder dividends, $31 million for common stock and $5 million for our preferred stock. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction in our deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG equal to their 12-month earnings. In other words, legacy Assurant dividends are still expected to equal segment earnings. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as profitable growth in the businesses. And we resumed our share repurchase program in July. This reflected our view of the stock as well as the higher level of deployable capital at the holding company following the acquisition close. Through August 3, we have bought back 319,000 shares for approximately $34 million. We believe our capital position will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, support The Warranty Group integration and return capital to shareholders in 2018 and beyond. 
As Alan previewed, we also updated our full year outlook for our segments to take into account TWG. Overall, we expect net operating income excluding catastrophe losses to increase 20% to 25% from $413 million in 2017. The lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24% will be a key driver of that with roughly 1/3 of savings being reinvested back into the business. We've already committed the majority of the spend in the second half of 2018 toward technology and capability enhancements, originally planned for next year. 
Another important driver of that earnings increase will be the contributions from TWG, along with organic growth in the business. More specifically, for the full year, Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, should increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should decline year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. This will be partially offset by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased penetration rates in our multifamily housing business. 
As a reminder, late last year, we benefited from unusually low noncat loss experience and additional income from processing a significant value of flood claims related to Hurricane Harvey. We are not expecting either of this to reoccur in the second half of 2018. 
Earnings growth in Global Lifestyle will reflect the combination of organic growth and the TWG acquisition, along with the benefit of lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth will be driven by mobile and auto, partially offset by declines in Financial Services, mainly from runoff and discontinued partnerships as we move into the third quarter. Foreign exchange could also be a factor. 
Looking at Connected Living. Mobile increases will be driven by programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion from our offerings with existing clients. But as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate, depending on the success of new phone introductions, availability of those phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. We expect continued growth in our Global Automotive business as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn, along with the contributions from TWG. This also includes synergies realized as we combine our operations and streamline our infrastructure. Based on our current plans, we expect to realize approximately $13 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in synergies this year. 
On a run-rate basis, this represents roughly half of our commitment to realize $60 million of pretax operating synergies by the end of 2019. We anticipate the majority of those synergies will be reflected in Lifestyle's results with some flowing through Corporate as we align our shared service functions. 
At Global Preneed, we anticipate earnings will continue to increase modestly before the impact of tax, driven by the expansion of new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. 
And finally, Corporate nonoperating loss is now expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. This reflects the adverse impact of a lower tax rate at roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, along with the additional net expenses associated with TWG. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
In addition, we expect our annual interest expense to increase to roughly $65 million after-tax for 2018, including the debt incurred to finance the TWG acquisition. Net operating income will also include around $11 million after-tax for the payment of our preferred dividends. 
Before moving into Q&A, I want to highlight certain key initial purchase accounting items related to TWG. As of June 30, we recorded $1.5 billion in goodwill and approximately $450 million in other intangible assets. These other intangible assets will be amortized over periods of up to 15 years based on the economic benefit achieved and, therefore, will not be linear. For 2018, we expect the pretax net impact of the purchase accounting adjustments in Global Lifestyle to be around $7 million, of which $1 million was expensed in June. Based on current estimates, we expect that amount to increase in 2019 to $18 million pretax for the full year and $27 million in 2020 as the business previously written begins to earn. This will eventually reach $30 million to $35 million pretax by year 5. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year.

We're now 2 months post-closing, and we're really 9 months post-planning for the deal after we announced that we were fortunate in some ways to have a 7-month period.

Two months in, we -- our run rate, about halfway to our $60 million pretax public commitment. And now that we own the company, we are beginning to aggressively go after revenue synergies, leveraging their infrastructure in certain markets to bring our products into those markets and similarly the other way around. We also have a significant opportunity in front of us in claims cost where, with our combined scale and now having 47 million vehicles that we manage globally. Both the revenue and the claims costs were not in our deal model. In terms of the accretion, what we've said is, when we announced the deal, it would be modestly accretive.

And those are really pulling forward critical technology and capability investments that help us really differentiate and innovate product offerings.

So the caller did help us when we -- the stock price came up very nicely at close. So that's one factor that came to us saying we can go back and start buying back again. I would say, overall, though, we just found ourselves in a very strong financial position, and so it was one of the elements. It wasn't the total element in our decision to go and start buying back.

If you look at how our margins have grown in Connected Living, in the fee businesses, the housing, a lot of that growth is coming from the various expense initiatives that had been underway. So we recognize we owe full accounting of that in the future, but we feel good about the progress. Specifically, the lender-placed, which is separate from what I just said, we put out a long-term expense target. We're a little bit above that right now as we're investing in that single platform.

The other two I mentioned, were revenue synergies where TWG, for example, have infrastructure in a company -- in a country, but doesn't necessarily have access to clients. We have the client relationships, but don't have that particular capability. We have a long list of specific opportunities that are in development with clients right now. Now most of those won't hit 2018. Those will be things that could begin to benefit 2019 and 2020, but they're not in the deal model. We assume 0 in the deal model. The other one I mentioned, is just claims cost around autos.

One example is electric, and obviously it's early days still for the adoption of electric cars. But if you think about an electric car from a consumer point of view, there's less that can go wrong, but when it goes wrong, it's really expensive. Our hypothesis to be proven is that, that will drive up attachment over time of service contracts. That's a significant opportunity. And one of the reasons why we're really intrigued by The Warranty Group, they're doing this heavily in markets like China that are ahead of the U.S. in kind of electric car technology today. Another major trend is autonomous vehicles and ridesharing, and again, that creates real opportunities. Cars may be owned differently, and that could change. But every time there's an owner, there's an opportunity when that car sells to attach a service contract. So in the short term, we haven't seen a lot of changes in attachment rate across the vehicle business. But longer term, we feel extremely well positioned compared to competitors to respond to some of these real long-term changes in the way cars are going to be owned and operated."

But with that said, volumes are gradually rising just because the market is gradually growing. And opportunities for us is consumers hold the phone longer. With what we've done in some of the markets, we're now doing effectively extended warranties on phones, which go beyond the underlying manufacturer warranty. That's what we've always done in autos.

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. 
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. On May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. 
As of June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results and the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March as well as related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock are also an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. For the period between March and closing, these financing costs were reflected only in our GAAP net income and therefore, not part of net operating income. 
In addition, last week, we closed the sale of our mortgage solutions business. While our second quarter 2018 results include the operating results in mortgage solutions, given the disposition, the associated assets and liabilities were held for sale with the resulting net loss of $34 million reflected in consolidated net income. Starting August 1, mortgage solutions results will no longer be included in operating results. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Initial contributions from The Warranty Group acquisition as well as the benefit from the lower effective U.S. tax rate. 
In May, we closed the acquisition of TWG and welcomed nearly 1,500 new colleagues to Assurant. Our global planning efforts during the months leading up to the close allowed us to hit the ground running on day 1. Relying on our principal of best of the best, we are now bringing together our organizations, leveraging the deep talent, processes and technology across our combined companies. Conversations with our clients also continue and feedback remains favorable. 
To capitalize on growth opportunities and emerging market trends, we've rebranded our vehicle business, now known as Global Automotive, under new leadership. We have dedicated leadership for each of our primary auto distribution channels as well as deeper expertise to drive innovation as we look to deliver new offerings to clients and consumers worldwide. 
We've also integrated TWG's extended service contract business within Connected Living with the growing focus of building our capabilities around the connected home. And we've realigned our legacy credit business, now named Financial Services, to pursue emerging opportunities in the banking sector. 
Globally, the acquisition meaningfully expands our business outside the U.S., increasing our total international annual revenues by 50%. We've also added infrastructure across Asia Pacific where we see some of our greatest opportunities, particularly around mobile. We have refined our view of operating synergies and are starting to realize these benefits. In addition, our business leaders are now pursuing potential revenue synergies, which provide upside to our original acquisition thesis. 
Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and more broadly, across our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Let me share some of the highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted very strong results for the quarter. While these included some onetime benefits, they illustrate momentum across Connected Living and Global Automotive. 
Our recently launched mobile programs continue to thrive from strong market success, particularly in Japan, which is the second largest postpaid mobile device market. We now protect 44 million covered mobile devices worldwide, and in Global Automotive, we are the market leader protecting nearly 47 million vehicles. 
Overall, we see significant opportunity to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing. The segment also posted solid results, driven by multifamily housing earnings and revenue growth and favorable loss experience in lender-placed. 
During the quarter, we finalized our $1.3 billion reinsurance program for 2018. We now protect more than 2.9 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. This coverage represents a projected probably maximum loss of a roughly 1 in 170-year event storm. So the likelihood of us exceeding the total coverage for 1 single event is significantly less than 1%. At the same time, we were able to lower our net loss prevent retention to $120 million as we continue to decrease the potential earnings volatility from cat losses. 
As part of our June announcement, we also shared several new metrics to further illustrate the strength of our program, including a review of historical losses and examples for how the 2018 program would work under various storm scenarios. We believe our continued commitment to excellence in risk management will again serve us well as we move through hurricane season. 
As exemplified by our cat program, protecting and servicing our policyholders is core to what we do each and every day. We were pleased to be recognized by 2 of our key lender-placed clients as one of their best vendors for delivering a superior customer experience. We also believe that in order to sustain this advantage, we must continue to invest, including in an ongoing enhancements to our processes and systems. Our work on our single-processing platform continues, and we expect to migrate another important client in the coming months. This new platform will generate significant cost savings and help deliver a better customer experience. 
With nearly 1.9 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate both strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we rolled out additional enhancements to our renters platform, which makes it easier to engage with our property management companies and their renters. This is yet another example of how we're investing to improve our customer experience and sustain our market-leading position. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we conducted a comprehensive strategic and financial assessment in mortgage solutions and decided to sell this business. One of the key criteria we used to evaluate our businesses is the ability to be market leaders. Despite some initial success, we did not see a long-term path to a leadership position for mortgage solutions. 
Last week, we closed on the sale to Xome Holdings for $35 million in cash with potential future payments based on performance. We believe Xome will be a better owner of this business, given its focus and committed resources in the space. The sale will allow us to concentrate on our core housing business as well as deploy greater resources to build out offerings in areas, such as the rental economy and the connected home. I'd like to thank the mortgage solutions team for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our clients, and I wish them the best as part of Xome. 
Turning to our financial results. We currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. Beginning in June, these metrics now include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. 
For the first 6 months of the year, Assurant's net operating income increased by $39 million or 20% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by strong organic growth in the business, a lower effective tax rate and initial contributions from TWG. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $4.24, up 21%, largely driven by earnings growth as well as 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end. 
At the end of June, holding company capital totaled $497 million after returning a total of $36 million in common and preferred dividends. In July, we resumed share repurchase activity given the stronger cash balance following the closing of the acquisition. As always, we are committed to managing our capital prudently and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Turning to our full year 2018 outlook, we've updated it to reflect the acquisition of TWG and the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. We now expect Assurant net operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophes to increase 20% to 25% from last year. This reflects contributions from TWG, included expected operating synergies, the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate and modest organic growth across our company. 
We also expect strong growth in net operating income per diluted share this year, however, at a slower rate than net operating income. This is mainly due to the effect of the TWG-related share issuance without a full run rate contribution of TWG income and synergies. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter 2018 results and updated segment outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,573687132,1540225,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2018",2018-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million o",1907,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million of the increase, as only a small amount of the tax savings was reinvested into the business in the quarter. The balance of the increase was due to more favorable noncatastrophe loss experience in lender-placed insurance and growth in multifamily housing. This was partially offset by ongoing declines in lender-placed, reflecting the strength of the housing market. 
Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses improved to 85.7% from 87% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to more favorable noncat loss experience compared to a very active hail and wind season last year. Results also benefited from lower expenses. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 14.3% from 11.7% in the second quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing as well as expense reductions. 
Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the second quarter. Given the strength of the overall market, we continued to see reductions in real estate on volumes and lower placement rates in lender-placed. Fee income was impacted by lower client demand in mortgage solutions, primarily in field services and valuations. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 21 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low-placement loans. We continue to expect ongoing declines in the placement rate for the balance of 2018, eventually beginning to moderate as we exit the year. 
Multifamily housing continued to grow, mainly from affinity partners and expansion of our international and other housing products. As noted earlier, while second quarter operating results for Global Housing still includes mortgage solutions, the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as of June 30, given the plan to sell the business. This resulted in an impairment loss of $34 million, reflected in our consolidated net income. The impact of the final purchase price and any other adjustments as part of the loss on sale of the subsidiary will be recorded in our third quarter financials. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $68 million for the second quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year period. This included a $5 million benefit from a lower effective tax rate following the passage of U.S. tax reform. In addition, TWG contributed $9.4 million after tax, inclusive of $1 million of realized operating synergies and $1 million of intangible amortization for the month of June. 
Excluding tax reform and the acquisition, results benefited from the ramp-up of the mobile programs launched last year as well as favorable loss experience in Global Automotive. We also recorded nearly $6 million of onetime contributions in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur. This encompasses $4 million related to a onetime tax benefit and $2 million from the Global Automotive business. Continued declines in Financial Services partially offset that increase. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up 32% or $266 million in the quarter. TWG accounted for $203 million of this increase. Looking more closely at the TWG contribution by line of business, approximately 70% of revenues is included in Global Automotive with 28% in Connected Living and the remainder in Financial Services. 
Organic growth was driven by new mobile programs, including an increase in subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection offerings. This was partially offset by lower average selling prices for mobile trade-in activity. 
Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved slightly to 96.6%. Excluding the acquisition, the ratio was unchanged. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 7.1% in the second quarter or 7.6% excluding TWG. This compares to 6.4% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by mobile programs started in 2017 in both Asia and the U.S. The Connected Living margin reflected the legacy TWG mix of business, mainly more sensitive -- more service contracts offerings. We would expect this to lower our reported Connected Living margin in the next few quarters. Overall, we're very pleased by Lifestyle's results for the first half of the year, which exceeded our expectations. 
Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $15 million in net operating income for the quarter, up $2 million year-over-year. This was exclusively due to lower tax rate. Only a modest amount of tax savings was reinvested back into the business in the quarter. 
Revenue in Preneed for the quarter was flat. Growth in the U.S., including prior period sales and the Final Need product, was offset by lower production in Canada compared to a favorable second quarter 2017. We are encouraged, however, by 8% growth in face sales after several periods of decline. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $17 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses and additional technology investments as well as a $2 million adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to capital, we ended June with $497 million in holding company capital or about $247 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends from the business totaled $296 million, which included $284 million of dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed. The $86 million from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities following tax reform was a key driver. In addition, $12 million of residual capital supporting our former benefits in health businesses contributed to the total. Overall, dividends as a percent of segment earnings year-to-date were at a higher level relative to our typical seasonal pattern as we prepared for the TWG closing in the quarter. 
Looking at outflows, we paid $36 million in shareholder dividends, $31 million for common stock and $5 million for our preferred stock. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction in our deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG equal to their 12-month earnings. In other words, legacy Assurant dividends are still expected to equal segment earnings. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as profitable growth in the businesses. And we resumed our share repurchase program in July. This reflected our view of the stock as well as the higher level of deployable capital at the holding company following the acquisition close. Through August 3, we have bought back 319,000 shares for approximately $34 million. We believe our capital position will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, support The Warranty Group integration and return capital to shareholders in 2018 and beyond. 
As Alan previewed, we also updated our full year outlook for our segments to take into account TWG. Overall, we expect net operating income excluding catastrophe losses to increase 20% to 25% from $413 million in 2017. The lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24% will be a key driver of that with roughly 1/3 of savings being reinvested back into the business. We've already committed the majority of the spend in the second half of 2018 toward technology and capability enhancements, originally planned for next year. 
Another important driver of that earnings increase will be the contributions from TWG, along with organic growth in the business. More specifically, for the full year, Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, should increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should decline year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. This will be partially offset by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased penetration rates in our multifamily housing business. 
As a reminder, late last year, we benefited from unusually low noncat loss experience and additional income from processing a significant value of flood claims related to Hurricane Harvey. We are not expecting either of this to reoccur in the second half of 2018. 
Earnings growth in Global Lifestyle will reflect the combination of organic growth and the TWG acquisition, along with the benefit of lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth will be driven by mobile and auto, partially offset by declines in Financial Services, mainly from runoff and discontinued partnerships as we move into the third quarter. Foreign exchange could also be a factor. 
Looking at Connected Living. Mobile increases will be driven by programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion from our offerings with existing clients. But as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate, depending on the success of new phone introductions, availability of those phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. We expect continued growth in our Global Automotive business as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn, along with the contributions from TWG. This also includes synergies realized as we combine our operations and streamline our infrastructure. Based on our current plans, we expect to realize approximately $13 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in synergies this year. 
On a run-rate basis, this represents roughly half of our commitment to realize $60 million of pretax operating synergies by the end of 2019. We anticipate the majority of those synergies will be reflected in Lifestyle's results with some flowing through Corporate as we align our shared service functions. 
At Global Preneed, we anticipate earnings will continue to increase modestly before the impact of tax, driven by the expansion of new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. 
And finally, Corporate nonoperating loss is now expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. This reflects the adverse impact of a lower tax rate at roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, along with the additional net expenses associated with TWG. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
In addition, we expect our annual interest expense to increase to roughly $65 million after-tax for 2018, including the debt incurred to finance the TWG acquisition. Net operating income will also include around $11 million after-tax for the payment of our preferred dividends. 
Before moving into Q&A, I want to highlight certain key initial purchase accounting items related to TWG. As of June 30, we recorded $1.5 billion in goodwill and approximately $450 million in other intangible assets. These other intangible assets will be amortized over periods of up to 15 years based on the economic benefit achieved and, therefore, will not be linear. For 2018, we expect the pretax net impact of the purchase accounting adjustments in Global Lifestyle to be around $7 million, of which $1 million was expensed in June. Based on current estimates, we expect that amount to increase in 2019 to $18 million pretax for the full year and $27 million in 2020 as the business previously written begins to earn. This will eventually reach $30 million to $35 million pretax by year 5. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year.

Let me start and then, Richard, you should feel free to add to it. We're now 2 months post-closing, and we're really 9 months post-planning for the deal after we announced that we were fortunate in some ways to have a 7-month period. And so we had a really good line of sight developed to the hard cost operating synergies, and we feel like that's going very well. Two months in, we -- our run rate, about halfway to our $60 million pretax public commitment. And now that we own the company, we are beginning to aggressively go after revenue synergies, leveraging their infrastructure in certain markets to bring our products into those markets and similarly the other way around. We also have a significant opportunity in front of us in claims cost where, with our combined scale and now having 47 million vehicles that we manage globally. Both the revenue and the claims costs were not in our deal model. In terms of the accretion, what we've said is, when we announced the deal, it would be modestly accretive. We're certainly still on track for that, and at the right point in time, once we have the run rate synergies, we'll come back to that.

The biggest factor in the second half of the year that will be a negative relative to the first half is spending some of those tax reform savings. We spent a little bit in the first half of the year. We're going to spend the balance of it in the second half of the year, and that's the majority of it.

And that piece of our business has actually been growing. One of the benefits of our much more competitive rates over the last 4 or 5 years is we are more competitive. It's just an alternative for the consumer. So the gradual decline in placement rates is really driven by the housing cycle of it. Importantly though, as we go into 2019, we are managing that business and with the expense actions we've been taking that we believe that business can stabilize and have flat earnings roughly next year no matter what happens if the placement rate continues to gradually decline.

One example is electric, and obviously it's early days still for the adoption of electric cars. But if you think about an electric car from a consumer point of view, there's less that can go wrong, but when it goes wrong, it's really expensive. Our hypothesis to be proven is that, that will drive up attachment over time of service contracts. That's a significant opportunity. And one of the reasons why we're really intrigued by The Warranty Group, they're doing this heavily in markets like China that are ahead of the U.S. in kind of electric car technology today. Another major trend is autonomous vehicles and ridesharing, and again, that creates real opportunities. Cars may be owned differently, and that could change. But every time there's an owner, there's an opportunity when that car sells to attach a service contract. So in the short term, we haven't seen a lot of changes in attachment rate across the vehicle business. But longer term, we feel extremely well positioned compared to competitors to respond to some of these real long-term changes in the way cars are going to be owned and operated."

But with that said, volumes are gradually rising just because the market is gradually growing. And opportunities for us is consumers hold the phone longer. With what we've done in some of the markets, we're now doing effectively extended warranties on phones, which go beyond the underlying manufacturer warranty. That's what we've always done in autos. Never been done in phones before at least by us, and it's creating a new growth opportunity for us in mobile. So no, we don't see anything that would cause us to say mobile's slowing down.

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. 
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. As a reminder, on May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. Beginning June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs. 
Dividend on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. 
Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Alan."

This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far, and we are starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market. 
We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of 600 -- $60 million, apologies, of run rate operating synergies by the end of next year. Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, pre-need and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth. 
As we've preannounced, we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program. I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need. 
Let me now share some recent highlights for our 3 business segments. They underscore our ongoing success building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation and customer excellence. 
Starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade and volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as global protection programs launched last year continue to gain momentum. 
In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide, and we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace. Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare Plus with theft and loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans, available in their stores, online and select resellers like Best Buy. 
The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss as well as software and technical support. Something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we've helped launch globally in the last 2 years, to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to get AppleCare services. While still very early, the performance has been tracking our expectations. 
Also on the 1-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes 4 years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end consumers. 
Our Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top line growth with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities. 
During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. 
We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. 
Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing, the segment generated solid results, excluding catastrophe losses. We continue to evolve and strengthen our specialty property offerings where we have leadership positions and differentiated capabilities. 
Our lender-placed insurance franchise remains strong and generates substantial cash flow. We recently renewed 2 significant clients with multiyear agreements and continue to make progress with our operating system migration. 
As we close out 2018, we believe lender-placed earnings will stabilize next year after several years of market declines. 
In multifamily housing, we continue to generate strong growth with a nearly 11% increase in revenue this quarter, and we now protect 2 million renters across the U.S. During the quarter, we became the exclusive provider of renters insurance to Village Green, one of the nation's premier property management companies, providing our suite of renters products and services through their more than 25,000 rental units in the U.S. 
Over the last several years, we have steadily built out our capabilities and offerings in the sharing economy space. We are focused on 3 key areas, on-demand mobility insurance, mainly in auto peer to peer and car fleet sharing, shared accommodations, primarily in the vacation rental market and shipping insurance. 
We now work with around 30 clients, including some of the most sought after brand names in the sharing economy market like Etsy, GM's car sharing program, Maven, and flex drive. 
While not yet a significant driver of revenue or earnings, we believe this is an area of growth potential where we have developed a recognized brand due to our innovative and adaptive approach. Overall, we believe these specialty offerings will help support profitable growth for Global Housing in the years ahead. 
And finally, Global Preneed. This segment posted record earnings, driven by recent growth in sales and total assets under mentioned. Our specialty products and the alignment with SCI in North America and other market leaders in Canada are key differentiators. 
We have recently standard our offerings to include ancillary products, such as support and assistance to will executors and those navigating via state planning process. 
Overall, preneed continues to produce strong returns and robust cash flows. 
Turning to our consolidated financial results, we currently measure our success against 3 key metrics, net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all, excluding catastrophe losses. 
Beginning in June, these metrics includes results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first 9 months of 2018, Assurant's net operating income increased by $58 million or 19% year-over-year to $371 million, driven by contributions from TWG, a lower effective tax rate and organic growth. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $6.37, up 13%. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end, mainly due to growth in earnings. 
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $473 million after returning $119 million in share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter. We also recently announced a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $776 million as of November 2. 
As always, our buybacks are subject to market conditions and other factors. We are committed to managing our capital prudently, maintaining balance sheet strength and sustaining our track record of investing in the business to support long-term profitable growth. All of this while returning excess capital to shareholders over time. 
As we approach the end of 2018, we continue to expect Assurant net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 20% to 25% from last year. 
As we look ahead to 2019, we remain focused on continuing to grow earnings and cash flow. To do so, we are fostering even greater collaboration across our lines of business to leverage our newly expanded global scale and expertise. This will be especially important as our lifestyle and housing markets converge around the connected consumer. 
We see opportunities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across our global operations through simplification, standardization and deployment of technologies, such as artificial intelligence. And technology investments we've made this year will support an even better customer experience, across channels globally. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter 2018 results and outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,586056827,1594946,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 mil",1544,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 million of lower caps. 
Third quarter included $67 million of losses related to wind and flood damage from Hurricane Florence and an increase in reserves for claims from Hurricane Maria. 
As a reminder, we incurred a total of $187 million in cat losses in the third quarter of last year. Excluding catastrophe losses and the tax rate change, net operating income declined by $8 million year-over-year, driven by less favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and expected declines in lender-placed. We also incurred additional technology expenses as we reinvested a portion of our tax savings with additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. 
Growth from our affinity partners and property management companies and multifamily housing and more favorable noncat loss experience from other specialty products like international dwelling partially offset the decline. The risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses, excluding cat losses, increased to 83.2% from 80.7% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to less favorable noncat loss experience from other weather-related claims and water damage in lender-placed insurance, a trend we expect to continue through year-end. 
We also incurred higher expenses in the quarter to support new business. With the sale of mortgage solutions and the expansion of other specialty property offerings, we are reevaluating Global Housing's profitability metrics for our capital-light businesses. 
We expect to share our conclusions with you, along with relevant segment targets at upcoming Investor Day in March. 
Moving to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions on August 1. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 9%, driven by growth in our commercial property products and multifamily housing. 
Revenue also increased from the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums, which were paid in the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in lender-placed premiums, mainly from lower real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 15 basis points year-over-year or 3 basis points from the second quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. We expect placement rate declines to continue to moderate. 
As we preannounced, fourth quarter results will include claims from Hurricane Michael. We continue to process claims and based on our view today, we believe losses will likely be in the range of $75 million to $105 million pretax. This is below our cat reinsurance program retention of $120 million. 
Excluding catastrophe losses, we expect Global Housing net operating income for this year to increase, driven by the benefit of a lower U.S. tax rate. While earnings will be lower absent tax, we are encouraged by the progress we've made to refocus our housing portfolio and moderate lender-placed declines. 
In addition, we expect to continue to grow revenue and earnings in multifamily housing and other specialty offerings over the long-term. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment earnings increased to $76 million for the third quarter. This included $29.9 million from acquisition of The Warranty Group. Net of $2.5 million, primarily related to intangible amortization. 
This also includes $5 million in realized operating synergies in the quarter. We also saw organic -- solid organic growth in Connected Living, mainly from new mobile programs launched in 2017 and ongoing expense management efforts within our extended service contract business. 
The effective tax rate was not a driver in the quarter because the net benefit from tax reform was nearly matched by a onetime gain in 2017. Lifestyle growth was partially offset by continued declines in Financial Services, driven by discontinued partnerships as we reposition our offerings within the banking sector. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $700 million year-over-year, primarily due to the 200 -- to the $626 million contribution from TWG. 
We saw continued growth in the North American auto business predominantly through the national dealer distribution channel. Organic growth within Global Lifestyle was driven by higher service contract volumes from our third-party distribution channel within global auto and strong subscriber growth from mobile programs, which started in 2017. 
Lower mobile trade-in volumes and a depreciation of the Argentine peso partially offset this increase. 
Turning to the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved to 97.2% from 99.2% due to catastrophe loss experience and the favorable impact from the TWG acquisition. 
As a reminder, in the third quarter 2017, we incurred losses mainly in our auto business of $7.7 million related to Hurricane Harvey compared to $1.4 million of claims this quarter related to Hurricane Florence. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.3% in the third quarter or 6.5%, excluding TWG earnings. This compares to 3.8% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by higher profit from global mobile programs started in 2017 and realized expense savings in the extended service contract business. 
Less favorable U.S. loss experience and lower contributions from Europe partially offset fee increase. As noted last quarter, the Connected Living margins reflect the inclusion of the TWG business, mainly more service contracts offerings with lower margins. 
Overall, for full year 2018, we expect continued organic growth in Global Lifestyle, driven by mobile and Global Automotive. 
Global Lifestyle earnings growth this year will reflect the TWG acquisition and organic growth, along with the benefit of the lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth should be mainly driven by mobile, partially offset by declines in Financial Services. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed, the segment reported $17 million in net operating income. This was an increase of $4.5 million year-over-year. Results included a $2 million benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate net of some reinvestments in the business. 
Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were up from greater investment income due to both higher invested assets and interest rates as well as growth in the business. 
Revenue in preneed was up 8% for the quarter, growth was driven by prior period sales of prefunded funerals and the Final Need product across U.S. and Canada. Base sales increased for the second consecutive quarter from expansion of our Final Need product with new distribution partners. 
To a lesser degree, results benefited from greater volume of prefunded funeral offerings in Canada and the U.S. As a reminder, last year's sales were adversely impacted by the significant hurricane activity in the quarter. 
We are pleased with preneed's strong results, but expect to see earnings moderate in the fourth quarter given seasonality and higher mortality as we near the winter months. 
For the full year, we still expect preneed earnings will increase modestly for the impact of tax. Business from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings should drive this expansion. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million, a year-over-year increase of $6 million. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher employee-related expenses as well as some additional technology investments. The other half was related to an adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the Corporate loss to increase from third quarter levels, similar to historic trends. Continued investments in artificial intelligence and connected home and the connected car should also be drivers. 
As a result, we believe the Corporate operating loss will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full year, as previously discussed. This includes the adverse impact of lower U.S. tax rate at roughly 20% with some reinvestment. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
Turning to capital. We ended September with $473 million in total holding company capital or about $223 million of deployable capital. Dividends from Global Housing lifestyle and preneed totaled $139 million and this included $75 million from the TWG entities. We also we received $35 million for the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. 
Looking at outflows, we deployed $83 million in share buybacks and $40 million in dividends. This is comprised of $35 million for our common stock and $5 million for our preferreds. 
In the fourth quarter through November 2, we have purchased 333,000 shares for approximately $34 million. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction of our deferred tax liability and full year dividends from TWG. 
Excluding the deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG, Assurant dividends are still expected to be in line with their segment earnings, inclusive of catastrophe losses. 
As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary regulatory capital requirements, rating agency considerations and the profitable growth of the businesses. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, and we remain focused on delivering on our full year commitments, a strong finish will position us well for continued profitable growth in 2019. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

And so we feel like we've done a good job of protecting our customers, our policyholders, our shareholders with the program. Over the years, we've been gradually reducing our retention so that our exposure has gone down significantly. And as we've added other lines of business like The Warranty Group and with the growth with Connected Living and mobile, much smaller portion of our earnings is cat exposed today. But certainly the last few years have been more volatile for storms than in the past, and we will be revisiting our reinsurance program with the right retention point as we go into the repurchase cycle for that in January."

As I mentioned in the remarks, we were on track for our synergies with TWG. We took out $5 million, looking forward to at least $10 million for the end of this year and on a run-rate basis being half of the $60 million we talked about. Across the enterprise, we're working on things like procurement and facilities, et cetera, and being very careful about how we're spending and making sure that whatever we spend, we are creating value. In terms of the saves, back in Investor Day, we had talked about $100 million in gross saves and last quarter, we reported that we are halfway through that mark. We continue to advance. So this quarter, I would just say we're a little bit above that mark in continuing to move forward. And in terms of the goals that we had set there for being $100 million at the end of 2020, we're well on track for that."

We've brought it down, earnings are more stable. As Alan said in an earlier question, our company is getting bigger, and so the exposure that we have to cat is getting smaller, just by definition, particularly as multi-family gross and lifestyle grows. So we definitely are looking at all of those things and -- but I would say if we look year-to-date through Q3, even with Hurricane Florence right up a little bit sub 92% combined ratio, so even there, that's a nice ROE for the business overall."

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.  
We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
As a reminder, on May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. Beginning June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance.

This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far, and we are starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market. 
We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of 600 million -- $60 million, apologies, of run-rate operating synergies by the end of next year. Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, pre-need and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth. 
As we've preannounced, we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program. I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need. 
Let me now share some recent highlights for our 3 business segments. They underscore our ongoing success, building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation and customer excellence. 
Starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade and volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as global protection programs launched last year continued to gain momentum. 
In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide, and we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace. Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare+ with theft and loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans, available in their stores, online and select resellers like Best Buy. 
The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss as well as software and technical support, something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we've helped launch globally in the last 2 years to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to AppleCare services. While still very early, the performance has been tracking our expectations. 
Also on the 1-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes 4 years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end consumers. 
Our Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top line growth with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities.
During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. 
We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. 
Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing, the segment generated solid results, excluding catastrophe losses. We continue to evolve and strengthen our specialty property offerings where we have leadership positions and differentiated capabilities. 
Our lender-placed insurance franchise remains strong and generates substantial cash flow. We recently renewed 2 significant clients with multiyear agreements and continue to make progress with our operating system migration. 
As we close out 2018, we believe lender-placed earnings will stabilize next year after several years of market declines. 
In multifamily housing, we continue to generate strong growth, with a nearly 11% increase in revenue this quarter, and we now protect 2 million renters across the U.S. During the quarter, we became the exclusive provider of renters insurance to Village Green, one of the nation's premier property management companies, providing our suite of renters products and services through their more than 25,000 rental units in the U.S. 
Over the last several years, we have steadily built out our capabilities and offerings in the sharing economy space. We are focused on 3 key areas, on-demand mobility insurance, mainly in auto peer-to-peer and car-fleet sharing, shared accommodations, primarily in the vacation rental market and shipping insurance. 
We now work with around 30 clients, including some of the most sought-after brand names in the sharing economy market like Etsy, GM's car sharing program, Maven, and Flexdrive. 
While not yet a significant driver of revenue or earnings, we believe this is an area of growth potential where we have developed a recognized brand due to our innovative and adaptive approach. Overall, we believe these specialty offerings will help support profitable growth for Global Housing in the years ahead. 
And finally, Global Preneed. This segment posted record earnings, driven by recent growth in sales and total assets under management. Our specialty products and the alignment with SCI in North America and other market leaders in Canada are key differentiators. 
We have recently standard our offerings to include ancillary products, such as support and assistance to will executors and those navigating the estate planning process. Overall, Preneed continues to produce strong returns and robust cash flows. 
Turning to our consolidated financial results, we currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. 
Beginning in June, these metrics include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first 9 months of 2018, Assurant's net operating income increased by $58 million or 19% year-over-year to $371 million, driven by contributions from TWG, a lower effective tax rate and organic growth. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $6.37, up 13%. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end, mainly due to growth in earnings. 
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $473 million after returning $119 million in share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter. We also recently announced a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $776 million as of November 2. 
As always, our buybacks are subject to market conditions and other factors. We are committed to managing our capital prudently, maintaining balance sheet strength and sustaining our track record of investing in the business to support long-term profitable growth, all of this while returning excess capital to shareholders over time. 
As we approach the end of 2018, we continue to expect Assurant net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 20% to 25% from last year. 
As we look ahead to 2019, we remain focused on continuing to grow earnings and cash flow. To do so, we are fostering even greater collaboration across our lines of business to leverage our newly expanded global scale and expertise. This will be especially important as our lifestyle and housing markets converge around the connected consumer. 
We see opportunities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across our global operations through simplification, standardization and deployment of technologies, such as artificial intelligence. And technology investments we've made this year will support an even better customer experience across channels globally. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter 2018 results and outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,586056827,1595190,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 mil",1545,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 million of lower cats. Third quarter included $67 million of losses related to wind and flood damage from Hurricane Florence and an increase in reserves for claims from Hurricane Maria. 
As a reminder, we incurred a total of $187 million in cat losses in the third quarter of last year. Excluding catastrophe losses and the tax rate change, net operating income declined by $8 million year-over-year, driven by less favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and expected declines in lender-placed. We also incurred additional technology expenses as we reinvested a portion of our tax savings with additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. 
Growth from our affinity partners in property management companies and multifamily housing and more favorable noncat loss experience from other specialty products like international dwelling partially offset the decline. The risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses, excluding cat losses, increased to 83.2% from 80.7% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to less favorable noncat loss experience from other weather-related claims and water damage in lender-placed insurance, a trend we expect to continue through year-end. 
We also incurred higher expenses in the quarter to support new business. With the sale of mortgage solutions and the expansion of other specialty property offerings, we are reevaluating Global Housing's profitability metrics for our capital-light businesses. We expect to share our conclusions with you, along with relevant segment targets at our upcoming Investor Day in March. 
Moving to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions on August 1. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 9%, driven by growth in our commercial property products and multifamily housing. 
Revenue also increased from the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums, which were paid in the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in lender-placed premiums, mainly from lower real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 15 basis points year-over-year or 3 basis points from the second quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. We expect placement rate declines to continue to moderate. 
As we preannounced, fourth quarter results will include claims from Hurricane Michael. We continue to process claims, and based on our view today, we believe losses will likely be in the range of $75 million to $105 million pretax. This is below our cat reinsurance prevent retention of $120 million. 
Excluding catastrophe losses, we expect Global Housing net operating income for this year to increase, driven by the benefit of a lower U.S. tax rate. While earnings will be lower absent tax, we are encouraged by the progress we've made to refocus our housing portfolio and moderate lender-placed declines. In addition, we expect to continue to grow revenue and earnings in multifamily housing and other specialty offerings over the long term. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment earnings increased to $76 million for the third quarter. This included $29.9 million from acquisition of The Warranty Group, net of $2.5 million primarily related to intangible amortization. 
This also includes $5 million in realized operating synergies in the quarter. We also saw organic -- solid organic growth in Connected Living, mainly from new mobile programs launched in 2017 and ongoing expense management efforts within our extended service contract business. 
The effective tax rate was not a driver in the quarter because the net benefit from tax reform was nearly matched by a onetime gain in 2017. Lifestyle growth was partially offset by continued declines in Financial Services, driven by discontinued partnerships as we repositioned our offerings within the banking sector. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $700 million year-over-year, primarily due to the 200 -- to the $626 million contribution from TWG. 
We saw continued growth in the North American auto business predominantly through the national dealer distribution channel. Organic growth within Global Lifestyle was driven by higher service contract volumes from our third-party distribution channel within global auto and strong subscriber growth from mobile programs, which started in 2017. Lower mobile trade-in volumes and a depreciation of the Argentine peso partially offset this increase. 
Turning to the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved to 97.2% from 99.2% due to catastrophe loss experience and the favorable impact from the TWG acquisition. As a reminder, in the third quarter 2017, we incurred losses mainly in our auto business of $7.7 million related to Hurricane Harvey compared to $1.4 million of claims this quarter related to Hurricane Florence. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.3% in the third quarter or 6.5%, excluding TWG earnings. This compares to 3.8% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by higher profit from global mobile programs started in 2017 and realized expense savings in the extended service contract business. Less favorable U.S. loss experience and lower contributions from Europe partially offset fee increase. 
As noted last quarter, the Connected Living margins reflect the inclusion of the TWG business, mainly more service contracts offerings with lower margins. 
Overall, for full year 2018, we expect continued organic growth in Global Lifestyle, driven by mobile in Global Automotive. 
Global Lifestyle earnings growth this year will reflect the TWG acquisition and organic growth, along with the benefit of the lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth should be mainly driven by mobile, partially offset by declines in Financial Services. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $17 million in net operating income. This was an increase of $4.5 million year-over-year. Results included a $2 million benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate, net of some reinvestments in the business. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were up from greater investment income due to both higher invested assets and interest rates as well as growth in the business. 
Revenue in Preneed was up 8% for the quarter, growth was driven by prior period sales of prefunded funerals and the Final Need product across U.S. and Canada. Base sales increased for the second consecutive quarter from expansion of our Final Need product with new distribution partners. 
To a lesser degree, results benefited from greater volume of prefunded funeral offerings in Canada and the U.S. As a reminder, last year's sales were adversely impacted by the significant hurricane activity in the quarter. We are pleased with Preneed's strong results but expect to see earnings moderate in the fourth quarter, given seasonality and higher mortality as we near the winter months. 
For the full year, we still expect Preneed earnings will increase modestly with the impact of tax. Business from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings should drive this expansion. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million, a year-over-year increase of $6 million. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher employee-related expenses as well as some additional technology investments. The other half was related to an adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the Corporate loss to increase from third quarter levels, similar to historic trends. Continued investments in artificial intelligence, the connected home and the connected car should also be drivers. As a result, we believe the Corporate operating loss will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full year, as previously discussed. This includes the adverse impact of lower U.S. tax rate at roughly 20% with some reinvestment. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
Turning to capital. We ended September with $473 million in total holding company capital or about $223 million of deployable capital. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed totaled $139 million, and this included $75 million from the TWG entities. We also received $35 million for the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. 
Looking at outflows, we deployed $83 million in share buybacks and $40 million in dividends. This is comprised of $35 million for our common stock and $5 million for our preferreds. 
In the fourth quarter through November 2, we have purchased 333,000 shares for approximately $34 million. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction of our deferred tax liability and full year dividends from TWG. 
Excluding the deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG, Assurant dividends are still expected to be in line with their segment earnings, inclusive of catastrophe losses. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary regulatory capital requirements, rating agency considerations and the profitable growth of the businesses. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, and we remain focused on delivering on our full year commitments. A strong finish will position us well for continued profitable growth in 2019. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Over the years, we've been gradually reducing our retention so that our exposure has gone down significantly. And as we've added other lines of business, like The Warranty Group and with the growth in Connected Living and mobile, a much smaller portion of our earnings is cat-exposed today.

But you'd see some of the Florida-specific carriers that have reduced their retention.

A lot of big diversified companies have made the decision that, that cat exposure and these volatile quarters are just not worth it. I think over the long term, they probably are.

We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
As a reminder, on May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. Beginning June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance.

Overall, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group.

This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far, and we are starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market. 
We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of 600 million -- $60 million, apologies, of run-rate operating synergies by the end of next year. Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, pre-need and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth. 
As we've preannounced, we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program. I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need. 
Let me now share some recent highlights for our 3 business segments. They underscore our ongoing success, building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation and customer excellence. 
Starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade and volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as global protection programs launched last year continued to gain momentum. 
In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide, and we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace. Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare+ with theft and loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans, available in their stores, online and select resellers like Best Buy. 
The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss as well as software and technical support, something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we've helped launch globally in the last 2 years to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to AppleCare services. While still very early, the performance has been tracking our expectations. 
Also on the 1-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes 4 years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end consumers. 
Our Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top line growth with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities.
During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. 
We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. 
Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing, the segment generated solid results, excluding catastrophe losses. We continue to evolve and strengthen our specialty property offerings where we have leadership positions and differentiated capabilities. 
Our lender-placed insurance franchise remains strong and generates substantial cash flow. We recently renewed 2 significant clients with multiyear agreements and continue to make progress with our operating system migration. 
As we close out 2018, we believe [ lender-placed ] earnings will stabilize next year after several years of market declines. 
In multifamily housing, we continue to generate strong growth, with a nearly 11% increase in revenue this quarter, and we now protect 2 million renters across the U.S. During the quarter, we became the exclusive provider of renters insurance to Village Green, one of the nation's premier property management companies, providing our suite of renters products and services through their more than 25,000 rental units in the U.S. 
Over the last several years, we have steadily built out our capabilities and offerings in the sharing economy space. We are focused on 3 key areas, on-demand mobility insurance, mainly in auto peer-to-peer and car-fleet sharing, shared accommodations, primarily in the vacation rental market and shipping insurance. 
We now work with around 30 clients, including some of the most sought-after brand names in the sharing economy market like Etsy, GM's car sharing program, Maven, and Flexdrive. 
While not yet a significant driver of revenue or earnings, we believe this is an area of growth potential where we have developed a recognized brand due to our innovative and adaptive approach. Overall, we believe these specialty offerings will help support profitable growth for Global Housing in the years ahead. 
And finally, Global Preneed. This segment posted record earnings, driven by recent growth in sales and total assets under management. Our specialty products and the alignment with SCI in North America and other market leaders in Canada are key differentiators. 
We have recently expanded our offerings to include ancillary products, such as support and assistance to will executors and those navigating the estate planning process. Overall, Preneed continues to produce strong returns and robust cash flows. 
Turning to our consolidated financial results, we currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. 
Beginning in June, these metrics include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first 9 months of 2018, Assurant's net operating income increased by $58 million or 19% year-over-year to $371 million, driven by contributions from TWG, a lower effective tax rate and organic growth. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $6.37, up 13%. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end, mainly due to growth in earnings. 
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $473 million after returning $119 million in share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter. We also recently announced a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $776 million as of November 2. 
As always, our buybacks are subject to market conditions and other factors. We are committed to managing our capital prudently, maintaining balance sheet strength and sustaining our track record of investing in the business to support long-term profitable growth, all of this while returning excess capital to shareholders over time. 
As we approach the end of 2018, we continue to expect Assurant net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 20% to 25% from last year. 
As we look ahead to 2019, we remain focused on continuing to grow earnings and cash flow. To do so, we are fostering even greater collaboration across our lines of business to leverage our newly expanded global scale and expertise. This will be especially important as our lifestyle and housing markets converge around the connected consumer. 
We see opportunities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across our global operations through simplification, standardization and deployment of technologies, such as artificial intelligence. And technology investments we've made this year will support an even better customer experience across channels globally. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter 2018 results and outlook in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,586056827,1595515,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 mil",1550,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 million of lower [ tax ] . Third quarter included $67 million of losses related to wind and flood damage from Hurricane Florence and an increase in reserves for claims from Hurricane Maria. 
As a reminder, we incurred a total of $187 million in cat losses in the third quarter of last year. Excluding catastrophe losses and the tax rate change, net operating income declined by $8 million year-over-year, driven by less favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and expected declines in lender-placed. We also incurred additional technology expenses as we reinvested a portion of our tax savings with additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. 
Growth from our affinity partners in property management companies and multifamily housing and more favorable noncat loss experience from other specialty products like international dwelling partially offset the decline. The risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses, excluding cat losses, increased to 83.2% from 80.7% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to less favorable noncat loss experience from other weather-related claims and water damage in lender-placed insurance, a trend we expect to continue through year-end. 
We also incurred higher expenses in the quarter to support new business. With the sale of mortgage solutions and the expansion of other specialty property offerings, we are reevaluating Global Housing's profitability metrics for our capital-light businesses. We expect to share our conclusions with you, along with relevant segment targets at our upcoming Investor Day in March. 
Moving to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions on August 1. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 9%, driven by growth in our commercial property products and multifamily housing. 
Revenue also increased from the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums, which were paid in the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in lender-placed premiums, mainly from lower real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 15 basis points year-over-year or 3 basis points from the second quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. We expect placement rate declines to continue to moderate. 
As we preannounced, fourth quarter results will include claims from Hurricane Michael. We continue to process claims, and based on our view today, we believe losses will likely be in the range of $75 million to $105 million pretax. This is below our cat reinsurance prevent retention of $120 million. 
Excluding catastrophe losses, we expect Global Housing net operating income for this year to increase, driven by the benefit of a lower U.S. tax rate. While earnings will be lower absent tax, we are encouraged by the progress we've made to refocus our housing portfolio and moderate lender-placed declines. In addition, we expect to continue to grow revenue and earnings in multifamily housing and other specialty offerings over the long term. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment earnings increased to $76 million for the third quarter. This included $29.9 million from acquisition of The Warranty Group, net of $2.5 million primarily related to intangible amortization. 
This also includes $5 million in realized operating synergies in the quarter. We also saw organic -- solid organic growth in Connected Living, mainly from new mobile programs launched in 2017 and ongoing expense management efforts within our extended service contract business. 
The effective tax rate was not a driver in the quarter because the net benefit from tax reform was nearly matched by a onetime gain in 2017. Lifestyle growth was partially offset by continued declines in Financial Services, driven by discontinued partnerships as we repositioned our offerings within the banking sector. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $700 million year-over-year, primarily due to the 200 -- to the $626 million contribution from TWG. 
We saw continued growth in the North American auto business predominantly through the national dealer distribution channel. Organic growth within Global Lifestyle was driven by higher service contract volumes from our third-party distribution channel within global auto and strong subscriber growth from mobile programs, which started in 2017. Lower mobile trade-in volumes and a depreciation of the Argentine peso partially offset this increase. 
Turning to the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved to 97.2% from 99.2% due to catastrophe loss experience and the favorable impact from the TWG acquisition. As a reminder, in the third quarter 2017, we incurred losses mainly in our auto business of $7.7 million related to Hurricane Harvey compared to $1.4 million of claims this quarter related to Hurricane Florence. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.3% in the third quarter or 6.5%, excluding TWG earnings. This compares to 3.8% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by higher profit from global mobile programs started in 2017 and realized expense savings in the extended service contract business. Less favorable U.S. loss experience and lower contributions from Europe partially offset fee increase. 
As noted last quarter, the Connected Living margins reflect the inclusion of the TWG business, mainly more service contracts offerings with lower margins. 
Overall, for full year 2018, we expect continued organic growth in Global Lifestyle, driven by mobile in Global Automotive. 
Global Lifestyle earnings growth this year will reflect the TWG acquisition and organic growth, along with the benefit of the lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth should be mainly driven by mobile, partially offset by declines in Financial Services. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $17 million in net operating income. This was an increase of $4.5 million year-over-year. Results included a $2 million benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate, net of some reinvestments in the business. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were up from greater investment income due to both higher invested assets and interest rates as well as growth in the business. 
Revenue in Preneed was up 8% for the quarter, growth was driven by [ prior period ] sales of prefunded funerals and the Final Need product across U.S. and Canada. Base sales increased for the second consecutive quarter from expansion of our Final Need product with new distribution partners. 
To a lesser degree, results benefited from greater volume of prefunded funeral offerings in Canada and the U.S. As a reminder, last year's sales were adversely impacted by the significant hurricane activity in the quarter. We are pleased with Preneed's strong results but expect to see earnings moderate in the fourth quarter, given seasonality and higher mortality as we near the winter months. 
For the full year, we still expect Preneed earnings will increase modestly with the impact of tax. Business from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings should drive this expansion. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million, a year-over-year increase of $6 million. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher employee-related expenses as well as some additional technology investments. The other half was related to an adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the Corporate loss to increase from third quarter levels, similar to historic trends. Continued investments in artificial intelligence, the connected home and the connected car should also be drivers. As a result, we believe the Corporate operating loss will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full year, as previously discussed. This includes the adverse impact of lower U.S. tax rate at roughly 20% with some reinvestment. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
Turning to capital. We ended September with $473 million in total holding company capital or about $223 million of deployable capital. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed totaled $139 million, and this included $75 million from the TWG entities. We also received $35 million for the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. 
Looking at outflows, we deployed $83 million in share buybacks and $40 million in dividends. This is comprised of $35 million for our common stock and $5 million for our preferreds. 
In the fourth quarter through November 2, we have purchased 333,000 shares for approximately $34 million. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction of our deferred tax liability and full year dividends from TWG. 
Excluding the deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG, Assurant dividends are still expected to be in line with their segment earnings, inclusive of catastrophe losses. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary regulatory capital requirements, rating agency considerations and the profitable growth of the businesses.

And so we feel like we've done a good job of protecting our customers, our policyholders, our shareholders with the program. Over the years, we've been gradually reducing our retention so that our exposure has gone down significantly. And as we've added other lines of business, like The Warranty Group and with the growth in Connected Living and mobile, a much smaller portion of our earnings is cat-exposed today. But certainly, the last few years have been more volatile more storms than in the past, and we will be revisiting our reinsurance program, what's the right retention point, as we go into the repurchase cycle for that in January."

But you'd see some of the Florida-specific carriers that have reduced their retention.

A lot of big diversified companies have made the decision that, that cat exposure and these volatile quarters are just not worth it. I think over the long term, they probably are.

We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
As a reminder, on May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. Beginning June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs. 
Dividends on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.

Overall, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group.

This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far, and we are starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market. 
We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of 600 million -- $60 million, apologies, of run-rate operating synergies by the end of next year. Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, pre-need and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth. 
As we've preannounced, we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program. I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need. 
Let me now share some recent highlights for our 3 business segments. They underscore our ongoing success, building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation and customer excellence. 
Starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade and volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as global protection programs launched last year continued to gain momentum. 
In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide, and we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace. Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare+ with theft and loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans, available in their stores, online and select resellers like Best Buy. 
The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss as well as software and technical support, something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we've helped launch globally in the last 2 years to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to AppleCare services. While still very early, the performance has been tracking our expectations. 
Also on the 1-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes 4 years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end consumers. 
Our Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top line growth with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities.
During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. 
We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. 
Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. 
Turning to Global Housing, the segment generated solid results, excluding catastrophe losses. We continue to evolve and strengthen our specialty property offerings where we have leadership positions and differentiated capabilities. 
Our lender-placed insurance franchise remains strong and generates substantial cash flow. We recently renewed 2 significant clients with multiyear agreements and continue to make progress with our operating system migration. 
As we close out 2018, we believe [ lender-placed ] earnings will stabilize next year after several years of market declines. 
In multifamily housing, we continue to generate strong growth, with a nearly 11% increase in revenue this quarter, and we now protect 2 million renters across the U.S. During the quarter, we became the exclusive provider of renters insurance to Village Green, one of the nation's premier property management companies, providing our suite of renters products and services through their more than 25,000 rental units in the U.S. 
Over the last several years, we have steadily built out our capabilities and offerings in the sharing economy space. We are focused on 3 key areas, on-demand mobility insurance, mainly in auto peer-to-peer and car-fleet sharing, shared accommodations, primarily in the vacation rental market and shipping insurance. 
We now work with around 30 clients, including some of the most sought-after brand names in the sharing economy market like Etsy, GM's car sharing program, Maven, and Flexdrive. 
While not yet a significant driver of revenue or earnings, we believe this is an area of growth potential where we have developed a recognized brand due to our innovative and adaptive approach. Overall, we believe these specialty offerings will help support profitable growth for Global Housing in the years ahead. 
And finally, Global Preneed. This segment posted record earnings, driven by recent growth in sales and total assets under management. Our specialty products and the alignment with SCI in North America and other market leaders in Canada are key differentiators. 
We have recently expanded our offerings to include ancillary products, such as support and assistance to will executors and those navigating the estate planning process. Overall, Preneed continues to produce strong returns and robust cash flows. 
Turning to our consolidated financial results, we currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. 
Beginning in June, these metrics include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first 9 months of 2018, Assurant's net operating income increased by $58 million or 19% year-over-year to $371 million, driven by contributions from TWG, a lower effective tax rate and organic growth. 
Operating earnings per diluted share was $6.37, up 13%. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end, mainly due to growth in earnings. 
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $473 million after returning $119 million in share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter. We also recently announced a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $776 million as of November 2. 
As always, our buybacks are subject to market conditions and other factors. We are committed to managing our capital prudently, maintaining balance sheet strength and sustaining our track record of investing in the business to support long-term profitable growth, all of this while returning excess capital to shareholders over time. 
As we approach the end of 2018, we continue to expect Assurant net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 20% to 25% from last year. 
As we look ahead to 2019, we remain focused on continuing to grow earnings and cash flow. To do so, we are fostering even greater collaboration across our lines of business to leverage our newly expanded global scale and expertise. This will be especially important as our lifestyle and housing markets converge around the connected consumer. 
We see opportunities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across our global operations through simplification, standardization and deployment of technologies, such as artificial intelligence. And technology investments we've made this year will support an even better customer experience across channels globally.

Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 mil",1550,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 million of lower [ tax ] . Third quarter included $67 million of losses related to wind and flood damage from Hurricane Florence and an increase in reserves for claims from Hurricane Maria. 
As a reminder, we incurred a total of $187 million in cat losses in the third quarter of last year. Excluding catastrophe losses and the tax rate change, net operating income declined by $8 million year-over-year, driven by less favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and expected declines in lender-placed. We also incurred additional technology expenses as we reinvested a portion of our tax savings with additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. 
Growth from our affinity partners in property management companies and multifamily housing and more favorable noncat loss experience from other specialty products like international dwelling partially offset the decline. The risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses, excluding cat losses, increased to 83.2% from 80.7% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to less favorable noncat loss experience from other weather-related claims and water damage in lender-placed insurance, a trend we expect to continue through year-end. 
We also incurred higher expenses in the quarter to support new business. With the sale of mortgage solutions and the expansion of other specialty property offerings, we are reevaluating Global Housing's profitability metrics for our capital-light businesses. We expect to share our conclusions with you, along with relevant segment targets at our upcoming Investor Day in March. 
Moving to revenue. Total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions on August 1. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 9%, driven by growth in our commercial property products and multifamily housing. 
Revenue also increased from the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums, which were paid in the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in lender-placed premiums, mainly from lower real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. 
The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 15 basis points year-over-year or 3 basis points from the second quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. We expect placement rate declines to continue to moderate. 
As we preannounced, fourth quarter results will include claims from Hurricane Michael. We continue to process claims, and based on our view today, we believe losses will likely be in the range of $75 million to $105 million pretax. This is below our cat reinsurance prevent retention of $120 million. 
Excluding catastrophe losses, we expect Global Housing net operating income for this year to increase, driven by the benefit of a lower U.S. tax rate. While earnings will be lower absent tax, we are encouraged by the progress we've made to refocus our housing portfolio and moderate lender-placed declines. In addition, we expect to continue to grow revenue and earnings in multifamily housing and other specialty offerings over the long term. 
Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment earnings increased to $76 million for the third quarter. This included $29.9 million from acquisition of The Warranty Group, net of $2.5 million primarily related to intangible amortization. 
This also includes $5 million in realized operating synergies in the quarter. We also saw organic -- solid organic growth in Connected Living, mainly from new mobile programs launched in 2017 and ongoing expense management efforts within our extended service contract business. 
The effective tax rate was not a driver in the quarter because the net benefit from tax reform was nearly matched by a onetime gain in 2017. Lifestyle growth was partially offset by continued declines in Financial Services, driven by discontinued partnerships as we repositioned our offerings within the banking sector. 
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $700 million year-over-year, primarily due to the 200 -- to the $626 million contribution from TWG. 
We saw continued growth in the North American auto business predominantly through the national dealer distribution channel. Organic growth within Global Lifestyle was driven by higher service contract volumes from our third-party distribution channel within global auto and strong subscriber growth from mobile programs, which started in 2017. Lower mobile trade-in volumes and a depreciation of the Argentine peso partially offset this increase. 
Turning to the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved to 97.2% from 99.2% due to catastrophe loss experience and the favorable impact from the TWG acquisition. As a reminder, in the third quarter 2017, we incurred losses mainly in our auto business of $7.7 million related to Hurricane Harvey compared to $1.4 million of claims this quarter related to Hurricane Florence. 
The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.3% in the third quarter or 6.5%, excluding TWG earnings. This compares to 3.8% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by higher profit from global mobile programs started in 2017 and realized expense savings in the extended service contract business. Less favorable U.S. loss experience and lower contributions from Europe partially offset fee increase. 
As noted last quarter, the Connected Living margins reflect the inclusion of the TWG business, mainly more service contracts offerings with lower margins. 
Overall, for full year 2018, we expect continued organic growth in Global Lifestyle, driven by mobile in Global Automotive. 
Global Lifestyle earnings growth this year will reflect the TWG acquisition and organic growth, along with the benefit of the lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth should be mainly driven by mobile, partially offset by declines in Financial Services. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $17 million in net operating income. This was an increase of $4.5 million year-over-year. Results included a $2 million benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate, net of some reinvestments in the business. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were up from greater investment income due to both higher invested assets and interest rates as well as growth in the business. 
Revenue in Preneed was up 8% for the quarter, growth was driven by [ prior period ] sales of prefunded funerals and the Final Need product across U.S. and Canada. Base sales increased for the second consecutive quarter from expansion of our Final Need product with new distribution partners. 
To a lesser degree, results benefited from greater volume of prefunded funeral offerings in Canada and the U.S. As a reminder, last year's sales were adversely impacted by the significant hurricane activity in the quarter. We are pleased with Preneed's strong results but expect to see earnings moderate in the fourth quarter, given seasonality and higher mortality as we near the winter months. 
For the full year, we still expect Preneed earnings will increase modestly with the impact of tax. Business from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings should drive this expansion. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million, a year-over-year increase of $6 million. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher employee-related expenses as well as some additional technology investments. The other half was related to an adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the Corporate loss to increase from third quarter levels, similar to historic trends. Continued investments in artificial intelligence, the connected home and the connected car should also be drivers. As a result, we believe the Corporate operating loss will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full year, as previously discussed. This includes the adverse impact of lower U.S. tax rate at roughly 20% with some reinvestment. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. 
Turning to capital. We ended September with $473 million in total holding company capital or about $223 million of deployable capital. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed totaled $139 million, and this included $75 million from the TWG entities. We also received $35 million for the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. 
Looking at outflows, we deployed $83 million in share buybacks and $40 million in dividends. This is comprised of $35 million for our common stock and $5 million for our preferreds. 
In the fourth quarter through November 2, we have purchased 333,000 shares for approximately $34 million. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction of our deferred tax liability and full year dividends from TWG. 
Excluding the deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG, Assurant dividends are still expected to be in line with their segment earnings, inclusive of catastrophe losses. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary regulatory capital requirements, rating agency considerations and the profitable growth of the businesses. 
In summary, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, and we remain focused on delivering on our full year commitments. A strong finish will position us well for continued profitable growth in 2019. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Over the years, we've been gradually reducing our retention so that our exposure has gone down significantly. And as we've added other lines of business, like The Warranty Group and with the growth in Connected Living and mobile, a much smaller portion of our earnings is cat-exposed today. But certainly, the last few years have been more volatile more storms than in the past, and we will be revisiting our reinsurance program, what's the right retention point, as we go into the repurchase cycle for that in January."
