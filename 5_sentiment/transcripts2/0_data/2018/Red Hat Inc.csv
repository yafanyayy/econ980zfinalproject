Our fourth quarter capped off an excellent year for Red Hat. Our global team executed well and we continued to experience strong demand for our technologies that enable digital transformation and hybrid cloud environments. We also continued to extend our strategic position as a trusted vendor for our customers as they look to modernize their data centers and adopt Red Hat technologies to build, deploy and manage cloud-native applications.
Our results were strong during the fourth quarter and contributed to several new records and milestones for the fiscal year. Here are just a few of those highlights.
First, the fourth quarter marked our 64th consecutive quarter of total revenue growth; second, our annual billings proxy exceeded the $3 billion milestone, while the fourth quarter marked the first time our billings proxy exceeded $1 billion in a quarter; third, strong sales execution led to our third straight quarter of 20% or better revenue growth, with 21% total revenue growth for the year. We exited Q4 with an annualized revenue run rate that exceeded the $3 billion mark; fourth, sales execution also contributed to a record total backlog of approximately $3.4 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year; and fifth, we continue to win larger, multiyear commitments from our customers. We had a record number of deals over $1 million for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. On a year-over-year basis, we had a 50% increase in deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter and a greater than 30% increase in deals over $1 million for the year in total.
Let me discuss some more highlights regarding Q4 deals. Overall, our large deal growth for the quarter was strong due to cross-selling and solid demand. For the quarter, we closed a total of 169 deals over $1 million and as I discussed a moment ago, that was up approximately 50% year-over-year. Within these deals, 26 were greater than $5 million, which is a record for any quarter. Included in the 26 deals were 14 that were greater than $10 million and 2 of those over $20 million. Cross selling was strong with 81% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of application development related and emerging technologies offerings. 1/3 of these deals contain 5 or more technologies across our portfolio of offerings, providing evidence of the value Red Hat is delivering to our customers based on expansion of our product portfolio in recent years.
Our top industry verticals within these deals greater than $1 million were financial services, tech and media, and our other category which includes mainstream sectors such as retail, healthcare and manufacturing. On the technology front, our biggest announcement during the quarter was our acquisition of CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solitons.  The acquisition of CoreOS further enhances our ability to help customers build applications and deploy them across hybrid environments.
By combining CoreOS' complementary capabilities with Red Hat's already brought Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including OpenShift, we aim to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads. CoreOS is the creator of CoreOS Tectonic, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform that provides automated operations, enables portability across private and public cloud providers and is based on open source software. It also offers CoreOS Quay, an enterprise-ready container registry. In addition, CoreOS' talented technical team is well known for helping to drive many of the open source innovations are at the heart of containerized applications, including Kubernetes where it is a leading contributor. These innovations include a lightweight Linux distribution created and maintained by CoreOS called container Linux, which automates software updates and is streamline for running containers. We continue to believe that the next era of technology will be driven by container-based applications that span multi and hybrid cloud environments, and that Kubernetes, containers and Linux will be the foundation of this transformation.
Both Red Hat and CoreOS have been leaders in open source communities and in bringing Kubernetes to enterprise customers. This acquisition further enhances Red Hat as a leader of hybrid cloud and modern application deployments, and will help us to expand our strategic position with customers.
In closing, we celebrated 25 years of open source software this past quarter, and Red Hat has been a major catalyst. As we welcome the team from CoreOS as part of the nearly 12,000 team of Global Red Hat associates, we are excited to have them join our efforts to drive innovation and growth in the future.
Let me also extend my thanks to all Red Hat associates who are keenly focused on helping our customers to succeed, and as a company, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the market opportunity in front of us.
On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the May 8 Analyst Day at Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. You'll hear directly from our customers and partners, including technology visionaries, leading industry players and cloud providers.
With that let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts of our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.Our",2158,"All right. Thank you, Jim. Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts of our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.
Our execution this year resulted in higher growth than FY 2017 across total revenue, non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow and continues to be attributable to the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the fourth quarter, we delivered a powerful combination of year-over-year growth of 23% for total revenue, 24% for non-GAAP operating income and 14% for operating cash flow. With that introduction, I will begin my remarks with a review of our Q4 performance, followed by a summary of the fiscal year results and then our outlook for FY '19. As I discuss our results, please note that many of the major foreign currencies that we transact business in have strengthened against the dollar since we provided guidance in December and as compared to prior year. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results with occasional references to constant currency details. You'll find a more detailed table of constant currency results as well as a more detailed review of our results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
We delivered $772 million of total revenue for the fourth quarter which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 23% in USD or 18% in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance by $9 million, which included a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $6 million. The remaining upside was driven mainly by stronger performance in our subscription business, coupled with continued healthy demand for our services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 88% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 22% year-over-year in USD or 18% in constant currency. High growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $510 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year in USD or 13% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our application development related and other emerging technology offerings was $173 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year in USD or 34% in constant currency. The primary driver to the performance in this area of our business was the growth we continued to experience with our Ansible, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies. The higher growth rates in these emerging technologies were partially offset by a slight moderation in the growth in our middleware offerings as some customers began to shift their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments where they would run middleware as a service within the OpenShift environment. We believe these initial efforts to use middleware as a service will increase over time as customers shift more applications to container environments benefiting our middleware results over the long run.
We view OpenShift and our middleware product as highly complementary to our overall cloud-native Application Development strategy. Application Development related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 22% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $89 million grew 29% year-over-year in USD or 23% in constant currency. The impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around our Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $190 million grew 24% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24.6%. This quarterly result was 30 basis points higher than Q4 last year and in line with the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call. This also includes the partial impact from the CoreOS acquisition of approximately $3 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Other income was $11 million, which included a one-time gain from the sale of a strategic investment which we noted in our December guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is inclusive of discrete tax benefits. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, up 46% year-over-year and $0.10 higher than our December guidance. The lower tax rate is a result of the U.S. tax reform and is the main reason for our higher non-GAAP EPS result versus our original guidance. Also related to the reform, we repatriated $486 million of foreign earnings and recorded a one-time tax expense of $123 million. The one-time tax expense was due to the transition tax on a repatriation and a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The one-time tax expense, along with our debt discount expense of approximately $5 million, are excluded from non-GAAP net income.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from the repatriation and the cash used for the acquisition of CoreOS, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash-based balances represent a 58%, 42% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.6 billion, an increase of $525 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $362 million for the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 58 days, in line with Q4 last year. Our cash flow performance was a result of higher profitability and strong billings, which was slightly moderated by our business linearity as it was weighted to the back end of the quarter. As Jim noted, we experienced significant growth in deals over $1 million which was up 50% year-over-year. However, many of these deals closed late in the quarter. As a result, the cash will be collected in the following quarter. This monthly linearity is something that we have discussed in prior calls and continue to actively manage.
The rolling 4 quarters average billings proxy was $838 million, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue, plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog, which we disclosed at the end of each fiscal year. Total backlog was up 24% year-over-year for our record balance in excess of $3.4 billion in USD. We define total backlog as the value of noncancelable subscription and service agreements which have billed, plus the value to be billed in the future not yet reflected in our financial statements. The billed portion of the backlog is total deferred revenue which was $2.6 billion. The other portion of total backlog, which is not yet billed, was an excess of $775 million, up 19% from the prior year. Of this $775 million, the portion to be billed over the next 12 months was in excess of $450 million, up approximately 36% year-over-year.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings. We continue to drive balanced bookings growth across our major geographies. This quarter, 58% of our bookings came from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 15% from Asia Pacific. The percent of business in the Americas was affected by a tough comparison due to the $100 million deal we closed in Q4 last year. After adjusting for this deal, the Americas would've had double-digit growth. The fourth quarter route-to-market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force compared to the fourth quarter prior year's split of 69% and 31%.
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. The 1 deal that did not renew is with a customer that is experiencing many challenges within their industry. We continue to partner with this customer to help understand the business transformation they need to implement and where our products may help accelerate this process. On an annual basis for this metric, we renewed 99 out of 100 of the top deals at greater than 120% in aggregate.
Our proxy for bookings duration was nearly 23 months, 2 months shorter than the 25 months duration reported in Q4 last year. This was, however, longer than we anticipated due to the strong growth of multiyear deals that were closed in the quarter. Looking at FY '19, we expect our billings duration metric to be 1 month lower than this past year's average of 22 months.
Now to briefly recap and summarize some of our highlights for our full fiscal year. Total revenue grew to $2.9 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars or 20% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew to $2.6 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars or 19% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was nearly $2 billion, up 15% in U.S. dollars or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for Application Development related and other emerging technologies was $624 million, up 42% in U.S. dollars or 40% in constant currency. For FY '18, application development related and other emerging technology subscriptions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 18% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 26% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $923 million, up 18% for a cash flow margin of approximately 32%. We repurchased $237 million or 2.3 million shares of Red Hat stock in the fiscal year, leaving a balance of $399 million in our repurchase program.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates which have generally strengthened against the dollar year-over-year. For the full year, we are estimating total revenue guidance of $3.425 billion to $3.460 billion, up approximately 19% in USD and 17% in constant currency at the high end of the range. Given the upfront financial impact related to the recent acquisition of CoreOS, coupled with our desire to target the strong demand for container technology, we plan on maintaining a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% in FY '19. This plan includes more than 100 basis points of expense related to the acquisition of CoreOS. In FY '20, we anticipate increasing operating margins by 25 to 50 basis points per year while continuing to invest in the strategic growth areas. We're estimating our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.38 to $3.41 per share, assuming approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and annual effective tax rate of 25% and approximately 185 million diluted shares.
On a GAAP basis, we expect GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.25 to $2.28, with estimated annual stock compensation expense of approximately $215 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $38 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million. We estimate capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Finally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion. We did not provide guidance on billings, but as we have experienced in past years, we expect Q1 to typically be our lowest quarter and we continue to see a modest shift to the second half of the year. Also as I mentioned previously, we're expecting a 1 month less -- 1 less month of bookings duration in FY '19. Typically Q1 has the lowest duration of the year but in Q1 FY '18, we closed a deal for $30 million for 3 years that both booked and billed upfront.
For Q1, we offer the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, which is up approximately 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 16% in constant currency; we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20.5%, which includes expenses for Red Hat Summit and our regional sales kickoff events; we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 with 185 million diluted shares; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.42, with 187 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping FY '18, we delivered strong results that reflect the continued adoption of the technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. Finally, I would like to thank all of our customers who have trusted us as their business partner and our associates around the world whose dedication and hard work helped to deliver these strong results both financially and operationally for our customers. We're optimistic that the execution this year will position as well for continued future growth.
And at this point, I would like to turn the call back to Elise for our first question."

One is the public cloud model, so Amazon run as a public cloud offering, open source as a service. And then Red Hat's model which is to be a significant contributor and offer on-premise and drive road maps for customers, et cetera, et cetera. So as we look at Kubernetes, we can talk about leadership or not, but if you look at the key people involved, it would be Google, which has the as a service way to monetize it, and Red Hat which has our enterprise model. I do think public clouds will offer Kubernetes as a service type offering out there. There is such a far gap between our contribution and #3 that I think it would take someone a very long time to build a credible position to offer an on-premise or a hybrid Kubernetes offering. So I never want to say the war is won. We have competitors. But I think we have a very substantial lead in being able to help enterprise customers implement Kubernetes beyond Google and Red Hat is a far, far distant #3 in terms of contribution and influence on that community. So I do feel like we're in really, really, really good shape there. Relative to Docker, Docker's a different animal, right? So Docker is doing different things, it's now adopted Kubernetes as its approach to orchestrating Docker containers. We certainly also orchestrate Docker form containers, but yes I think we're more open to other types of container formats, so it's hard to compare them directly. So -- but I will say, I don't see Docker in many of the deals that we're involved in. I think they're a little bit more developer focused at this point. So I feel really good about our position across a container platform. Obviously our position in Kubernetes has put us, I think, a far lead over everyone else."

So Michael, I mean, one of the things I had in my prepared remarks, we did see this year some back-end loading of the deals in the fourth quarter closing the last couple of weeks. In fact, even some of the last weeks of the quarter. So as we modeled out of this upcoming year, we assume similar assumptions as we went into both of the second half of this year as well as into Q4 specifically. And again, as we've been saying is our deals are getting larger, became a more complex. You can appreciate the fact that with our customers, a lot more procurement organizations are getting involved and it will naturally skew some of this to the backend of part of the quarter. Where linearity is most important in Q4 obviously is what gets closed in 1 month and month 2, we can certainly collect in month 3. But what's happening is we're seeing more activity closing in month 3, which then the cash flows collecting them in the following year. So what I would say is, we're assuming very similar trends for this upcoming Q4 as we had this past year, but certainly we are going to -- we are working with the sales teams to see if we can get some of that activity, pull it out of month 3  into either month 1 or month 2 within the fourth quarter. So what I would say is, we had really seen good progress in linearity Q1 to Q3, and then not too terribly unexpected, we sell a bit of a bigger shift again some of it's because of our year-end. And we would not do any kind of unusual discounting in the end of the year, otherwise. So that kind of nationality forced some of the stuff to happen in the last month of the quarter. So what I would say, Michael, that we are continuing to work on getting those little bit more in parity. I do think you'll see improvement in FY '20. We are continuing to see a trail off of some of the cash taxes that we're going to have in this year as well, and that I expect that to taper off a little bit more as we get into FY '20. So I don't think they're going to get exactly in parity in FY '20, but they're going to start closing that a little bit more than what you're seeing now."

Because so the OpenShift platform, one of our real strengths is we can run both traditional staple applications and kind of cloud-native applications on the portfolio. So the traditional staple applications can pull Java, EAP et cetera, out of the middleware portfolio, right? And so as people migrate applications, that migration often is off of WebSphere, WebLogic onto JBoss as the containerized application server on OpenShift. And so we get a lot of attach as people are doing brownfield for the more greenfield cloud native stuff, that's when stuff like BRMS, our rules engine, BPM, Fuse, so our kind of services that you need, whether that's messaging or integration or rules, that you do need or API management on a new, more modern application, those get dragged through on the newer stuff. So settle bit of both and kind of depends on the use case and a lot of companies will start with one cap like I'm going to do my cloud data stuff and they justify their pay for by moving the traditional brownfield. But again, depends a little bit on the customer. But across the board, I mean, once you're building on OpenShift, it does just make it easy, and we make it easy to consume any of the middleware services. And so that's why I think we're seeing a good tailwind there."

Our fourth quarter capped off an excellent year for Red Hat. Our global team executed well, and we continued to experience strong demand for our technologies that enable digital transformation in hybrid cloud environments. We also continued to extend our strategic position as a trusted vendor for our customers as they look to modernize their data centers and adopt Red Hat technologies to build, deploy and manage cloud-native applications.
Our results were strong during the fourth quarter and contributed to several new records and milestones for the fiscal year. Here are just a few of those highlights: First, the fourth quarter marked our 64th consecutive quarter of total revenue growth; Second, our annual billings proxy exceeded the $3 billion milestone, while the fourth quarter marked the first time our billings proxy exceeded $1 billion in a quarter; Third, strong sales execution led to our third straight quarter of 20% or better revenue growth with 21% total revenue growth for the year. We exited Q4 with an annualized revenue run rate that exceeded the $3 billion mark; Fourth, sales execution also contributed to a record total backlog of approximately $3.4 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year; and fifth, we continued to win larger multi-year commitments from our customers. We had a record number of deals over $1 million for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. On a year-over-year basis, we had a 50% increase in deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter and a greater than 30% increase in deals over $1 million for the year in total.
Let me discuss some more highlights regarding Q4 deals. Overall, our large deal growth for the quarter was strong due to cross-selling and solid demand. For the quarter, we closed a total of 169 deals over $1 million, and as I discussed a moment ago, that was up approximately 50% year-over-year. Within these deals, 26 were greater than $5 million, which is a record for any quarter. Included in the 26 deals were 14 that were greater than $10 million and 2 of those over $20 million. Cross-selling was strong with 81% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of application development related and emerging technologies offerings. 1/3 of these deals contain 5 or more technologies across our portfolio of offerings, providing evidence of the value Red Hat is delivering to our customers based on expansion of our product portfolio in recent years.
Our top industry verticals within these deals greater than $1 million were financial services, tech and media and our other category, which includes mainstream sectors such as retail, health care and manufacturing. On the technology front, our biggest announcement during the quarter was our acquisition of CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solitons. The acquisition of CoreOS further enhances our ability to help customers build applications and deploy them across hybrid environments.
By combining CoreOS' complementary capabilities with Red Hat's already broad Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including OpenShift, we aim to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads. CoreOS is the creator of CoreOS Tectonic, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform that provides automated operations, enables portability across private and public cloud providers and is based on open source software. It also offers CoreOS Quay, an enterprise-ready container registry. In addition, CoreOS' talented technical team is well known for helping to drive many of the open source innovations that are at the heart of containerized applications, including Kubernetes where it is a leading contributor. These innovations include a lightweight Linux distribution created and maintained by CoreOS called Container Linux, which automates software updates and is streamlined for running containers. We continue to believe that the next era of technology will be driven by container-based applications that span multi and hybrid cloud environments and that Kubernetes, containers and Linux will be the foundation of this transformation.
Both Red Hat and CoreOS have been leaders in open source communities and in bringing Kubernetes to enterprise customers. This acquisition further enhances Red Hat as a leader of hybrid cloud and modern application deployments and will help us to expand our strategic position with customers.
In closing, we celebrated 25 years of open source software this past quarter, and Red Hat has been a major catalyst. As we welcome the team from CoreOS as part of the nearly 12,000 team of global Red Hat associates, we are excited to have them join our efforts to drive innovation and growth in the future. Let me also extend my thanks to all Red Hat associates who are keenly focused on helping our customers to succeed, and as a company, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the market opportunity in front of us.
On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the May 8 Analyst Day at Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. You'll hear directly from our customers and partners, including technology visionaries, leading industry players and cloud providers.
With that let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.O",2156,"All right. Thank you, Jim. Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.
Our execution this year resulted in higher growth than FY 2017 across total revenue, non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow and continues to be attributable to the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the fourth quarter, we delivered a powerful combination of year-over-year growth of 23% for total revenue, 24% for non-GAAP operating income and 14% for operating cash flow. With that introduction, I will begin my remarks with a review of our Q4 performance, followed by a summary of the fiscal year results and then our outlook for FY '19. As I discuss our results, please note that many of the major foreign currencies that we transact business in have strengthened against the dollar since we provided guidance in December and as compared to prior year. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results with occasional references to constant currency details. You will find a more detailed table of constant currency results as well as a more detailed review of our results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
We delivered $772 million of total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 23% in USD or 18% in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance by $9 million, which included a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $6 million. The remaining upside was driven mainly by stronger performance in our subscription business coupled with continued healthy demand for our services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 88% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 22% year-over-year in USD or 18% in constant currency. High growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $510 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year in USD or 13% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our application development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $173 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year in USD or 34% in constant currency. The primary driver to the performance in this area of our business was the growth we continued to experience with our Ansible, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies. The higher growth rates in these emerging technologies were partially offset by a slight moderation in the growth in our middleware offerings as some customers begin to shift their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments where they would run middleware as a service within the OpenShift environment. We believe these initial efforts to use middleware as a service will increase over time as customers shift more applications to container environments, benefiting our middleware results over the long run.
We view OpenShift and our middleware product as highly complementary to our overall cloud-native Application Development strategy. Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 22% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $89 million grew 29% year-over-year in USD or 23% in constant currency. The impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around our Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $190 million grew 24% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24.6%. This quarterly result was 30 basis points higher than Q4 last year and in line with the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call. This also includes the partial impact from the CoreOS acquisition of approximately $3 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Other income was $11 million, which included a onetime gain from the sale of a strategic investment, which we noted in our December guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is inclusive of discrete tax benefits. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, up 46% year-over-year and $0.10 higher than our December guidance. The lower tax rate is a result of the U.S. tax reform and is the main reason for our higher non-GAAP EPS result versus our original guidance.
Also related to the reform, we repatriated $486 million of foreign earnings and recorded a onetime tax expense of $123 million. The onetime tax expense was due to the transition tax on a repatriation and a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The onetime tax expense along with our debt discount expense of approximately $5 million are excluded from non-GAAP net income.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from the repatriation and the cash used for the acquisition of CoreOS, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash-based balances represent a 58%-42% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.6 billion, an increase of $525 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $362 million for the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Our FX adjusted DSO was 58 days, in line with Q4 last year. Our cash flow performance was a result of higher profitability and strong billings, which was slightly moderated by our business linearity as it was weighted to the back end of the quarter. As Jim noted, we experienced significant growth in deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. However, many of these deals closed late in the quarter. As a result, the cash will be collected in the following quarter. This monthly linearity is something that we have discussed on prior calls and continue to actively manage.
The rolling 4 quarters average billings proxy was $838 million, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog, which we disclosed at the end of each fiscal year. Total backlog was up 24% year-over-year for our record balance in excess of $3.4 billion in USD. We define total backlog as the value of non-cancelable subscriptions and service agreements, which have billed, plus the value to be billed in the future but not yet reflected in our financial statements. The billed portion of the backlog is total deferred revenue, which was $2.6 billion. The other portion of total backlog, which has not yet billed, was in excess of $775 million, up 19% from the prior year. Of this $775 million, the portion to be billed over the next 12 months was in excess of $450 million, up approximately 36% year-over-year.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings. We continued to drive balanced bookings growth across our major geographies. This quarter, 58% of our bookings came from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 15% from Asia Pacific. The percent of business in the Americas was affected by a tough comparison due to the $100 million deal we closed in Q4 last year. After adjusting for this deal, the Americas would have had double-digit growth. The fourth quarter route-to-market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force compared to the fourth quarter prior year's split of 69% and 31%.
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is with a customer that is experiencing many challenges within their industry. We continue to partner with this customer to help understand the business transformation they need to implement and where our products may help accelerate this process. On an annual basis for this metric, we renewed 99 out of 100 of the top deals at greater than 120% in aggregate.
Our proxy for bookings duration was nearly 23 months, 2 months shorter than the 25 months duration reported in Q4 last year. This was, however, longer than we anticipated due to the strong growth of multi-year deals that were closed in the quarter. Looking at FY '19, we expect our billings duration metric to be 1 month lower than this past year's average of 22 months.
Now to briefly recap and summarize some of our highlights for our full fiscal year. Total revenue grew to $2.9 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars or 20% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew to $2.6 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars or 19% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was nearly $2 billion, up 15% in U.S. dollars or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for Application Development-related and other emerging technologies was $624 million, up 42% in U.S. dollars or 40% in constant currency. For FY '18, Application Development-related and other emerging technology subscriptions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 18% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 26% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $923 million, up 18% for a cash flow margin of approximately 32%. We repurchased $237 million or 2.3 million shares of Red Hat stock in the fiscal year, leaving a balance of $399 million in our repurchase program.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally strengthened against the dollar year-over-year. For the full year, we are estimating total revenue guidance of $3.425 billion to $3.460 billion, up approximately 19% in USD and 17% in constant currency at the high end of the range. Given the upfront financial impact related to the recent acquisition of CoreOS, coupled with our desire to target the strong demand for container technology, we plan on maintaining a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% in FY '19. This plan includes more than 100 basis points of expense related to the acquisition of CoreOS. In FY '20, we anticipate increasing operating margins by 25 to 50 basis points per year while continuing to invest in the strategic growth areas. We're estimating our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.38 to $3.41 per share, assuming approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of 25% and approximately 185 million diluted shares.
On a GAAP basis, we expect GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.25 to $2.28 with estimated annual stock compensation expense of approximately $215 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $38 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million. We estimate capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Finally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
We do not provide guidance on billings, but as we have experienced in past years, we expect Q1 to typically be our lowest quarter and we continue to see a modest shift to the second half of the year. Also as I mentioned previously, we're expecting a 1 month less -- 1 less month of bookings duration in FY '19. Typically, Q1 has the lowest duration of the year, but in Q1 FY '18, we closed a deal for $30 million for 3 years that both booked and billed upfront.
For Q1, we offer the following outlook: We expect revenue to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, which is up approximately 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 16% in constant currency; We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20.5%, which includes expenses for Red Hat Summit and our regional sales kick-off events; We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 with 185 million diluted shares; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.42 with 187 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping FY '18, we delivered strong results that reflect the continued adoption of the technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. Finally, I would like to thank all of our customers who have trusted us as their business partner and our associates around the world whose dedication and hard work helped to deliver these strong results both financially and operationally for our customers. We're optimistic that the execution this year will position us well for continued future growth.
And at this point, I would like to turn the call back to Elise for our first question."

We have many, many, many more customers. I will also say they obviously do a top-down traditional sale, where their average customer size, if you just take their revenue and number of customers is 1.5 million.

Just real quick, contextually, there have only been 2 successful models for monetizing open source. One is the public cloud model, so Amazon runs as a public cloud offering, open source as a service and then Red Hat's model, which is to be a significant contributor and offer on-premise and drive road maps for customers, et cetera, et cetera. So as we look at Kubernetes, we can talk about leadership or not, but if you look at the key people involved, it would be Google, which has the as a service way to monetize it, and Red Hat, which has our enterprise model. I do think public clouds will offer Kubernetes-as-a-service type offerings out there. There is such a far gap between our contribution and #3 that I think it would take somewhat a very long time to build a credible position to offer an on-premise or a hybrid Kubernetes offering. So I never want to say the war is won. We have competitors. But I think we have a very substantial lead in being able to help enterprise customers implement Kubernetes. Beyond Google and Red Hat, it is a far, far distant #3 in terms of contribution and influence on that community. So I do feel like we're in really, really, really good shape there. Relative to Docker, Docker's a different animal, right? So Docker is doing different things. It's now adopted Kubernetes as its approach to orchestrating Docker containers. We certainly also orchestrate Docker form containers, but I think we're more open to other types of container formats. So it's hard to compare them directly, so -- but I will say, I don't see Docker in many of the deals that we are involved in. I think they're a little bit more developer focused at this point. So I feel really good about our position across a container platform. Obviously, our position in Kubernetes has put us, I think, at a far lead over everyone else."

So Michael, I mean, one of the things I had in my prepared remarks, I mean, we did see this year some back-end loading of the deals in the fourth quarter closing the last couple weeks, in fact, even some of the last week of the quarter. So as we modeled out this upcoming year, we assumed similar assumptions as we went into both the second half of this year as well as into Q4 specifically. And again, as we've been saying is our deals are getting larger, getting more complex. You can appreciate the fact that with our customers, a lot more procurement organizations are getting involved, and they're -- and it will naturally skew some of this to the back-end part of the quarter. Where linearity is most important in Q4, obviously, is what gets closed in month 1 and month 2. We can certainly collect in month 3. But what's happening is we are seeing more activity closing in month 3, which then the cash flow's collected in the following year. So what I would say is we're assuming very similar trends for this upcoming Q4 as we had this past year, but certainly, we are going to -- we are working with the sales teams to see if we can get some of that activity, pull it out of month 3 into either month 1 or month 2 within the fourth quarter. So what I would say is we had really seen good progress in linearity Q1 to Q3, and then not too terribly unexpected, we saw a little bit of a bigger shift. Again, some of it's because of our year-end. And we would not do any kind of unusual discounting in the end of the year otherwise, so that kind of naturally force some of the stuff to happen in the last month of the quarter. So what I would say, Michael, is we are continuing to work on getting those a little bit more in parity. I do think you'll see improvement in FY '20. We are continuing to see a trail off of some of the cash taxes that we're going to have in this year as well, and then I expect that to taper off a little bit more as we get into FY '20.

We've had a big focus though on our core platforms of OpenShift and OpenStack, and then we're driving attached to those platforms. And so as we do that, the middleware is kind of consumed as a service on OpenShift. And so I think in the medium term -- in the very short term, it's lead to some slightly lower growth rates on the middleware side, which has kind of pulled the App Dev and emerging down a bit. But I think what we're trying to say is, overall, OpenShift drives greater affinity to our middleware, and we see long term that growing quite nicely as we see a large percentage of our customers who buy OpenShift ultimately buy a fair amount of middleware from us. So there's a nice synergy across that, and so that's really what we're trying to say there."

So it's a bit of both because -- so the OpenShift platform, one of our real strengths is we can run both traditional staple applications and kind of cloud-native applications on the portfolio. So the traditional staple applications can pull Java, EAP, et cetera, out of the middleware portfolio, right? And so as people migrate applications, that migration often is off of WebSphere, WebLogic onto JBoss as the containerized application server on OpenShift. And so we get a lot of attach as people are doing brownfield for the more greenfield cloud native stuff. That's when stuff like BRMS, our rules engine, BPM, Fuse, so our kind of services that you need, whether that's messaging or integration or rules that you do need or API management on a new, more modern application, those get dragged through on the newer stuff. So it's a little bit on both and kind of depends on the use case. And a lot of companies will start with one, like I'm going to do my cloud native stuff, and then they justify and they pay for it by moving the traditional brownfield. But again, it depends a little bit on the customer. But across the board, I mean, once you're building on OpenShift, it does just make it easy, and we make it easy to consume any of the middleware services. And so that's why I think we're seeing a good tailwind there."

It fits in the CI/CD pipeline and this whole DevOps world. It fits, again, as you start thinking about managing network devices or seeing the same thing with -- in security, where security is moving for people wanting to just have issues identified to having them remediated and Ansible's a particularly good technology to do that.

So really, the vast, vast majority of the cases, it's kind of replacing DIY, people running scripts and running around with fobs and that kind of stuff.

Here are just a few of those highlights: First, the fourth quarter marked our 64th consecutive quarter of total revenue growth; second, our annual billings proxy exceeded the $3 billion milestone, while the fourth quarter marked the first time our billings proxy exceeded $1 billion in a quarter; third, strong sales execution led to our third straight quarter of 20% or better revenue growth with 21% total revenue growth for the year. We exited Q4 with an annualized revenue run rate that exceeded the $3 billion mark; fourth, sales execution also contributed to a record total backlog of approximately $3.4 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year; and fifth, we continued to win larger multi-year commitments from our customers. We had a record number of deals over $1 million for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. On a year-over-year basis, we had a 50% increase in deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter and a greater than 30% increase in deals over $1 million for the year in total.
Let me discuss some more highlights regarding Q4 deals. Overall, our large deal growth for the quarter was strong due to cross-selling and solid demand. For the quarter, we closed a total of 169 deals over $1 million, and as I discussed a moment ago, that was up approximately 50% year-over-year. Within these deals, 26 were greater than $5 million, which is a record for any quarter. Included in the 26 deals were 14 that were greater than $10 million and 2 of those over $20 million. Cross-selling was strong with 81% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of application development related and emerging technologies offerings. 1/3 of these deals contain 5 or more technologies across our portfolio of offerings, providing evidence of the value Red Hat is delivering to our customers based on expansion of our product portfolio in recent years.
Our top industry verticals within these deals greater than $1 million were financial services, tech and media and our other category, which includes mainstream sectors such as retail, health care and manufacturing. On the technology front, our biggest announcement during the quarter was our acquisition of CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solitons. The acquisition of CoreOS further enhances our ability to help customers build applications and deploy them across hybrid environments.
By combining CoreOS' complementary capabilities with Red Hat's already broad Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including OpenShift, we aim to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads. CoreOS is the creator of CoreOS Tectonic, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform that provides automated operations, enables portability across private and public cloud providers and is based on open source software. It also offers CoreOS Quay, an enterprise-ready container registry. In addition, CoreOS' talented technical team is well known for helping to drive many of the open source innovations that are at the heart of containerized applications, including Kubernetes where it is a leading contributor. These innovations include a lightweight Linux distribution created and maintained by CoreOS called Container Linux, which automates software updates and is streamlined for running containers. We continue to believe that the next era of technology will be driven by container-based applications that span multi and hybrid cloud environments and that Kubernetes, containers and Linux will be the foundation of this transformation. Both Red Hat and CoreOS have been leaders in open source communities and in bringing Kubernetes to enterprise customers. This acquisition further enhances Red Hat as a leader of hybrid cloud and modern application deployments and will help us to expand our strategic position with customers.
In closing, we celebrated 25 years of open source software this past quarter, and Red Hat has been a major catalyst. As we welcome the team from CoreOS as part of the nearly 12,000 team of global Red Hat associates, we are excited to have them join our efforts to drive innovation and growth in the future. Let me also extend my thanks to all Red Hat associates who are keenly focused on helping our customers to succeed, and as a company, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the market opportunity in front of us. On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the May 8 Analyst Day at Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. You'll hear directly from our customers and partners, including technology visionaries, leading industry players and cloud providers.
With that let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.O",2157,"All right. Thank you, Jim. Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.
Our execution this year resulted in higher growth than FY 2017 across total revenue, non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow and continues to be attributable to the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the fourth quarter, we delivered a powerful combination of year-over-year growth of 23% for total revenue, 24% for non-GAAP operating income and 14% for operating cash flow. With that introduction, I will begin my remarks with a review of our Q4 performance, followed by a summary of the fiscal year results and then our outlook for FY '19. As I discuss our results, please note that many of the major foreign currencies that we transact business in have strengthened against the dollar since we provided guidance in December and as compared to prior year. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results with occasional references to constant currency details. You will find a more detailed table of constant currency results as well as a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
We delivered $772 million of total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 23% in USD or 18% in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance by $9 million, which included a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $6 million. The remaining upside was driven mainly by stronger performance in our subscription business coupled with continued healthy demand for our services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 88% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 22% year-over-year in USD or 18% in constant currency. High growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $510 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year in USD or 13% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our application development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $173 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year in USD or 34% in constant currency. The primary driver to the performance in this area of our business was the growth we continued to experience with our Ansible, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies. The higher growth rates in these emerging technologies were partially offset by a slight moderation in the growth in our middleware offerings as some customers begin to shift their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments where they would run middleware as a service within the OpenShift environment. We believe these initial efforts to use middleware as a service will increase over time as customers shift more applications to container environments, benefiting our middleware results over the long run.
We view OpenShift and our middleware product as highly complementary to our overall cloud-native Application Development strategy. Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 22% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $89 million grew 29% year-over-year in USD or 23% in constant currency. The impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around our Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $190 million grew 24% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24.6%. This quarterly result was 30 basis points higher than Q4 last year and in line with the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call. This also includes the partial impact from the CoreOS acquisition of approximately $3 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Other income was $11 million, which included a onetime gain from the sale of a strategic investment, which we noted in our December guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is inclusive of discrete tax benefits. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, up 46% year-over-year and $0.10 higher than our December guidance. The lower tax rate is a result of the U.S. tax reform and is the main reason for our higher non-GAAP EPS result versus our original guidance. Also related to the reform, we repatriated $486 million of foreign earnings and recorded a onetime tax expense of $123 million. The onetime tax expense was due to the transition tax on a repatriation and a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The onetime tax expense along with our debt discount expense of approximately $5 million are excluded from non-GAAP net income.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from the repatriation and the cash used for the acquisition of CoreOS, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash-based balances represent a 58%-42% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.6 billion, an increase of $525 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $362 million for the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Our FX adjusted DSO was 58 days, in line with Q4 last year. Our cash flow performance was a result of higher profitability and strong billings, which was slightly moderated by our business linearity as it was weighted to the back end of the quarter. As Jim noted, we experienced significant growth in deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. However, many of these deals closed late in the quarter. As a result, the cash will be collected in the following quarter. This monthly linearity is something that we have discussed on prior calls and continue to actively manage. The rolling 4 quarters average billings proxy was $838 million, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog, which we disclose at the end of each fiscal year. Total backlog was up 24% year-over-year for our record balance in excess of $3.4 billion in USD. We define total backlog as the value of non-cancelable subscriptions and service agreements, which have billed, plus the value to be billed in the future but not yet reflected in our financial statements. The billed portion of the backlog is total deferred revenue, which was $2.6 billion. The other portion of total backlog, which has not yet billed, was in excess of $775 million, up 19% from the prior year. Of this $775 million, the portion to be billed over the next 12 months was in excess of $450 million, up approximately 36% year-over-year.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings. We continued to drive balanced bookings growth across our major geographies. This quarter, 58% of our bookings came from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 15% from Asia Pacific. The percent of business in the Americas was affected by a tough comparison due to the $100 million deal we closed in Q4 last year. After adjusting for this deal, the Americas would have had double-digit growth. The fourth quarter route-to-market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force compared to the fourth quarter prior year's split of 69% and 31%.
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is with a customer that is experiencing many challenges within their industry. We continue to partner with this customer to help understand the business transformation they need to implement and where our products may help accelerate this process. On an annual basis for this metric, we renewed 99 out of 100 of the top deals at greater than 120% in aggregate. Our proxy for bookings duration was nearly 23 months, 2 months shorter than the 25 months duration reported in Q4 last year. This was, however, longer than we anticipated due to the strong growth of multi-year deals that were closed in the quarter. Looking at FY '19, we expect our billings duration metric to be 1 month lower than this past year's average of 22 months.
Now to briefly recap and summarize some of our highlights for our full fiscal year. Total revenue grew to $2.9 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars or 20% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew to $2.6 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars or 19% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was nearly $2 billion, up 15% in U.S. dollars or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for Application Development-related and other emerging technologies was $624 million, up 42% in U.S. dollars or 40% in constant currency. For FY '18, Application Development-related and other emerging technology subscriptions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 18% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 26% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $923 million, up 18% for a cash flow margin of approximately 32%. We repurchased $237 million or 2.3 million shares of Red Hat stock in the fiscal year, leaving a balance of $399 million in our repurchase program.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally strengthened against the dollar year-over-year. For the full year, we are estimating total revenue guidance of $3.425 billion to $3.460 billion, up approximately 19% in USD and 17% in constant currency at the high end of the range. Given the upfront financial impact related to the recent acquisition of CoreOS, coupled with our desire to target the strong demand for container technology, we plan on maintaining a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% in FY '19. This plan includes more than 100 basis points of expense related to the acquisition of CoreOS. In FY '20, we anticipate increasing operating margins by 25 to 50 basis points per year while continuing to invest in the strategic growth areas. We're estimating our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.38 to $3.41 per share, assuming approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of 25% and approximately 185 million diluted shares.
On a GAAP basis, we expect GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.25 to $2.28 with estimated annual stock compensation expense of approximately $215 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $38 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million. We estimate capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Finally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
We do not provide guidance on billings, but as we have experienced in past years, we expect Q1 to typically be our lowest quarter and we continue to see a modest shift to the second half of the year. Also as I mentioned previously, we are expecting a 1 month less -- 1 less month of bookings duration in FY '19. Typically, Q1 has the lowest duration of the year, but in Q1 FY '18, we closed a deal for $30 million for 3 years that both booked and billed upfront.
For Q1, we offer the following outlook: We expect revenue to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, which is up approximately 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 16% in constant currency; we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20.5%, which includes expenses for Red Hat Summit and our regional sales kick-off events; we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 with 185 million diluted shares; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.42 with 187 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping FY '18, we delivered strong results that reflect the continued adoption of the technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. Finally, I would like to thank all of our customers who have trusted us as their business partner and our associates around the world whose dedication and hard work helped to deliver these strong results both financially and operationally for our customers. We're optimistic that the execution this year will position us well for continued future growth.
And at this point, I would like to turn the call back to Elise for our first question."

We have many, many, many more customers. I will also say they obviously do a top-down traditional sale, where their average customer size, if you just take their revenue and number of customers is 1.5 million.

And what that's really done for us though is helped us accelerate some of the technical hiring that we were going to be pursuing this year that we have essentially brought in at the end of last year. So we're extremely thrilled to have the CoreOS team with us. I think it does really help kind of -- as we've said before, it helps us reaffirm our #2 position within the Kubernetes project.

So I never want to say the war is won. We have competitors. But I think we have a very substantial lead in being able to help enterprise customers implement Kubernetes. Beyond Google and Red Hat, it is a far, far distant #3 in terms of contribution and influence on that community. So I do feel like we're in really, really, really good shape there. Relative to Docker, Docker's a different animal, right? So Docker is doing different things. It's now adopted Kubernetes as its approach to orchestrating Docker containers. We certainly also orchestrate Docker form headed containers, but I think we're more open to other types of container formats. So it's hard to compare them directly, so -- but I will say, I don't see Docker in many of the deals that we are involved in. I think they're a little bit more developer focused at this point. So I feel really good about our position across a container platform. Obviously, our position in Kubernetes has put us, I think, at a far lead over everyone else."

So Michael, I mean, one of the things I had in my prepared remarks, I mean, we did see this year some back-end loading of the deals in the fourth quarter closing the last couple weeks, in fact, even some of the last week of the quarter. So as we modeled out this upcoming year, we assumed similar assumptions as we went into both the second half of this year as well as into Q4 specifically. And again, as we've been saying is our deals are getting larger, getting more complex. You can appreciate the fact that with our customers, a lot more procurement organizations are getting involved, and they're -- and it will naturally skew some of this to the back-end part of the quarter. Where linearity is most important in Q4, obviously, is what gets closed in month 1 and month 2. We can certainly collect in month 3. But what's happening is we are seeing more activity closing in month 3, which then the cash flow's collected in the following year. So what I would say is we're assuming very similar trends for this upcoming Q4 as we had this past year. But certainly, we are going to -- we are working with the sales teams to see if we can get some of that activity, pull it out of month 3 into either month 1 or month 2 within the fourth quarter. So what I would say is we had really seen good progress in linearity Q1 through Q3, and then not too terribly unexpected, we saw a little bit of a bigger shift. Again, some of it's because of our year-end. And we would not do any kind of unusual discounting in the end of the year otherwise, so that kind of naturally force some of the stuff to happen in the last month of the quarter. So what I would say, Michael, is we are continuing to work on getting those a little bit more in parity. I do think you'll see improvement in FY '20. We are continuing to see a trail off of some of the cash taxes that we're going to have in this year as well, and then I expect that to taper off a little bit more as we get into FY '20. So I don't think they're going to get exactly in parity in FY '20, but they're going to start closing that gap a little bit more than what you're seeing now."

So it's a bit of both because -- so the OpenShift platform, one of our real strengths is we can run both traditional staple applications and kind of cloud-native applications on the portfolio. So the traditional staple applications can pull Java, EAP, et cetera, out of the middleware portfolio, right. And so as people migrate applications, that migration often is off of WebSphere, WebLogic onto JBoss as the containerized application server on OpenShift. And so we get a lot of attach as people are doing brownfield for the more greenfield cloud native stuff. That's when stuff like BRMS, our rules engine, BPM, Fuse, so our kind of services that you need, whether that's messaging or integration or rules that you do need or API management on a new, more modern application, those get dragged through on the newer stuff. So it's a little bit on both and kind of depends on the use case. And a lot of companies will start with one, like I'm going to do my cloud native stuff, and then they justify and they pay for it by moving the traditional brownfield. But again, it depends a little bit on the customer. But across the board, I mean, once you're building on OpenShift, it does just make it easy, and we make it easy to consume any of the middleware services.

We have some large, especially in financial services, just customers with kind of RHEL-based type workloads and as they're putting in new infrastructure, putting those on OpenStack as it's continued to mature. So it's a whole mix there. Trying to see I pull up some more specifics on the deals. But it really is kind of a whole mix of what I'll call general-purpose types of workloads. It's across government, technology, a lot of financial services in there as well. So and a lot of those -- actually, a chunk of those have RHEL as well in there, but a chunk of them are also OpenShift. So it really is kind of a whole mix of general-purpose workloads."

We even -- we released a networking product or module really in the fall. We've already had 14 material Ansible wins. Of the large deals over $1 million, 53 had Ansible components in it. So it continues to grow really nicely. The nice part about it is it fits in broadly as you start thinking about automating containers, and so it fits in that space. It fits in the CI/CD pipeline and this whole DevOps world. It fits, again, as you start thinking about managing network devices or seeing the same thing with -- in security, where security is moving for people wanting to just have issues identified to having them remediated and Ansible's a particularly good technology to do that. So it's just a general-purpose technology that's easy to use, and so we're seeing that really across the board. So it fits well into our core cloud strategy, but it fits in kind of nicely in a number of scenarios. And especially as we start to see IoT in those types of use cases, it really is a great solution for a whole set of pain points there. So it's growing really, really well, and I think, we see nothing to say that's going to slow down."

So really, the vast, vast majority of the cases, it's kind of replacing DIY, people running scripts and running around with fobs and that kind of stuff.

Our fourth quarter capped off an excellent year for Red Hat. Our global team executed well, and we continued to experience strong demand for our technologies that enable digital transformation in hybrid cloud environments. We also continued to extend our strategic position as a trusted vendor for our customers as they look to modernize their data centers and adopt Red Hat technologies to build, deploy and manage cloud-native applications.
Our results were strong during the fourth quarter and contributed to several new records and milestones for the fiscal year. Here are just a few of those highlights: First, the fourth quarter marked our 64th consecutive quarter of total revenue growth; second, our annual billings proxy exceeded the $3 billion milestone, while the fourth quarter marked the first time our billings proxy exceeded $1 billion in a quarter; third, strong sales execution led to our third straight quarter of 20% or better revenue growth with 21% total revenue growth for the year. We exited Q4 with an annualized revenue run rate that exceeded the $3 billion mark; fourth, sales execution also contributed to a record total backlog of approximately $3.4 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year; and fifth, we continued to win larger multi-year commitments from our customers. We had a record number of deals over $1 million for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. On a year-over-year basis, we had a 50% increase in deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter and a greater than 30% increase in deals over $1 million for the year in total.
Let me discuss some more highlights regarding Q4 deals. Overall, our large deal growth for the quarter was strong due to cross-selling and solid demand. For the quarter, we closed a total of 169 deals over $1 million, and as I discussed a moment ago, that was up approximately 50% year-over-year. Within these deals, 26 were greater than $5 million, which is a record for any quarter. Included in the 26 deals were 14 that were greater than $10 million and 2 of those over $20 million. Cross-selling was strong with 81% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of application development related and emerging technologies offerings. 1/3 of these deals contain 5 or more technologies across our portfolio of offerings, providing evidence of the value Red Hat is delivering to our customers based on expansion of our product portfolio in recent years.
Our top industry verticals within these deals greater than $1 million were financial services, tech and media and our other category, which includes mainstream sectors such as retail, health care and manufacturing. On the technology front, our biggest announcement during the quarter was our acquisition of CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solitons. The acquisition of CoreOS further enhances our ability to help customers build applications and deploy them across hybrid environments.
By combining CoreOS' complementary capabilities with Red Hat's already broad Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including OpenShift, we aim to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads. CoreOS is the creator of CoreOS Tectonic, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform that provides automated operations, enables portability across private and public cloud providers and is based on open source software. It also offers CoreOS Quay, an enterprise-ready container registry. In addition, CoreOS' talented technical team is well known for helping to drive many of the open source innovations that are at the heart of containerized applications, including Kubernetes where it is a leading contributor. These innovations include a lightweight Linux distribution created and maintained by CoreOS called Container Linux, which automates software updates and is streamlined for running containers. We continue to believe that the next era of technology will be driven by container-based applications that span multi and hybrid cloud environments and that Kubernetes, containers and Linux will be the foundation of this transformation. Both Red Hat and CoreOS have been leaders in open source communities and in bringing Kubernetes to enterprise customers. This acquisition further enhances Red Hat as a leader of hybrid cloud and modern application deployments and will help us to expand our strategic position with customers.
In closing, we celebrated 25 years of open source software this past quarter, and Red Hat has been a major catalyst. As we welcome the team from CoreOS as part of the nearly 12,000 team of global Red Hat associates, we are excited to have them join our efforts to drive innovation and growth in the future. Let me also extend my thanks to all Red Hat associates who are keenly focused on helping our customers to succeed, and as a company, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the market opportunity in front of us. On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the May 8 Analyst Day at Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. You'll hear directly from our customers and partners, including technology visionaries, leading industry players and cloud providers.
With that let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.O",2157,"All right. Thank you, Jim. Let me also add my appreciation for the strong execution and the efforts that our global associates delivered during the quarter and the fiscal year, which resulted in strong financial performance that was above our guidance.
Our execution this year resulted in higher growth than FY 2017 across total revenue, non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow and continues to be attributable to the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the fourth quarter, we delivered a powerful combination of year-over-year growth of 23% for total revenue, 24% for non-GAAP operating income and 14% for operating cash flow. With that introduction, I will begin my remarks with a review of our Q4 performance, followed by a summary of the fiscal year results and then our outlook for FY '19. As I discuss our results, please note that many of the major foreign currencies that we transact business in have strengthened against the dollar since we provided guidance in December and as compared to prior year. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results with occasional references to constant currency details. You will find a more detailed table of constant currency results as well as a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
We delivered $772 million of total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 23% in USD or 18% in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance by $9 million, which included a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $6 million. The remaining upside was driven mainly by stronger performance in our subscription business coupled with continued healthy demand for our services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 88% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 22% year-over-year in USD or 18% in constant currency. High growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $510 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year in USD or 13% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our application development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $173 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year in USD or 34% in constant currency. The primary driver to the performance in this area of our business was the growth we continued to experience with our Ansible, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies. The higher growth rates in these emerging technologies were partially offset by a slight moderation in the growth in our middleware offerings as some customers begin to shift their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments where they would run middleware as a service within the OpenShift environment. We believe these initial efforts to use middleware as a service will increase over time as customers shift more applications to container environments, benefiting our middleware results over the long run.
We view OpenShift and our middleware product as highly complementary to our overall cloud-native Application Development strategy. Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 22% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $89 million grew 29% year-over-year in USD or 23% in constant currency. The impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around our Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $190 million grew 24% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24.6%. This quarterly result was 30 basis points higher than Q4 last year and in line with the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call. This also includes the partial impact from the CoreOS acquisition of approximately $3 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Other income was $11 million, which included a onetime gain from the sale of a strategic investment, which we noted in our December guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is inclusive of discrete tax benefits. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, up 46% year-over-year and $0.10 higher than our December guidance. The lower tax rate is a result of the U.S. tax reform and is the main reason for our higher non-GAAP EPS result versus our original guidance. Also related to the reform, we repatriated $486 million of foreign earnings and recorded a onetime tax expense of $123 million. The onetime tax expense was due to the transition tax on a repatriation and a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The onetime tax expense along with our debt discount expense of approximately $5 million are excluded from non-GAAP net income.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from the repatriation and the cash used for the acquisition of CoreOS, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash-based balances represent a 58%-42% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.6 billion, an increase of $525 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $362 million for the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Our FX adjusted DSO was 58 days, in line with Q4 last year. Our cash flow performance was a result of higher profitability and strong billings, which was slightly moderated by our business linearity as it was weighted to the back end of the quarter. As Jim noted, we experienced significant growth in deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. However, many of these deals closed late in the quarter. As a result, the cash will be collected in the following quarter. This monthly linearity is something that we have discussed on prior calls and continue to actively manage. The rolling 4 quarters average billings proxy was $838 million, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog, which we disclose at the end of each fiscal year. Total backlog was up 24% year-over-year for our record balance in excess of $3.4 billion in USD. We define total backlog as the value of non-cancelable subscriptions and service agreements, which have billed, plus the value to be billed in the future but not yet reflected in our financial statements. The billed portion of the backlog is total deferred revenue, which was $2.6 billion. The other portion of total backlog, which has not yet billed, was in excess of $775 million, up 19% from the prior year. Of this $775 million, the portion to be billed over the next 12 months was in excess of $450 million, up approximately 36% year-over-year.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings. We continued to drive balanced bookings growth across our major geographies. This quarter, 58% of our bookings came from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 15% from Asia Pacific. The percent of business in the Americas was affected by a tough comparison due to the $100 million deal we closed in Q4 last year. After adjusting for this deal, the Americas would have had double-digit growth. The fourth quarter route-to-market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force compared to the fourth quarter prior year's split of 69% and 31%.
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is with a customer that is experiencing many challenges within their industry. We continue to partner with this customer to help understand the business transformation they need to implement and where our products may help accelerate this process. On an annual basis for this metric, we renewed 99 out of 100 of the top deals at greater than 120% in aggregate. Our proxy for bookings duration was nearly 23 months, 2 months shorter than the 25 months duration reported in Q4 last year. This was, however, longer than we anticipated due to the strong growth of multi-year deals that were closed in the quarter. Looking at FY '19, we expect our billings duration metric to be 1 month lower than this past year's average of 22 months.
Now to briefly recap and summarize some of our highlights for our full fiscal year. Total revenue grew to $2.9 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars or 20% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew to $2.6 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars or 19% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was nearly $2 billion, up 15% in U.S. dollars or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for Application Development-related and other emerging technologies was $624 million, up 42% in U.S. dollars or 40% in constant currency. For FY '18, Application Development-related and other emerging technology subscriptions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 18% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 26% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $923 million, up 18% for a cash flow margin of approximately 32%. We repurchased $237 million or 2.3 million shares of Red Hat stock in the fiscal year, leaving a balance of $399 million in our repurchase program.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally strengthened against the dollar year-over-year. For the full year, we are estimating total revenue guidance of $3.425 billion to $3.460 billion, up approximately 19% in USD and 17% in constant currency at the high end of the range. Given the upfront financial impact related to the recent acquisition of CoreOS, coupled with our desire to target the strong demand for container technology, we plan on maintaining a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% in FY '19. This plan includes more than 100 basis points of expense related to the acquisition of CoreOS. In FY '20, we anticipate increasing operating margins by 25 to 50 basis points per year while continuing to invest in the strategic growth areas. We're estimating our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.38 to $3.41 per share, assuming approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of 25% and approximately 185 million diluted shares.
On a GAAP basis, we expect GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.25 to $2.28 with estimated annual stock compensation expense of approximately $215 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $38 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million. We estimate capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Finally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
We do not provide guidance on billings, but as we have experienced in past years, we expect Q1 to typically be our lowest quarter and we continue to see a modest shift to the second half of the year. Also as I mentioned previously, we are expecting a 1 month less -- 1 less month of bookings duration in FY '19. Typically, Q1 has the lowest duration of the year, but in Q1 FY '18, we closed a deal for $30 million for 3 years that both booked and billed upfront.
For Q1, we offer the following outlook: We expect revenue to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, which is up approximately 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 16% in constant currency; we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20.5%, which includes expenses for Red Hat Summit and our regional sales kick-off events; we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 with 185 million diluted shares; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.42 with 187 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping FY '18, we delivered strong results that reflect the continued adoption of the technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. Finally, I would like to thank all of our customers who have trusted us as their business partner and our associates around the world whose dedication and hard work helped to deliver these strong results both financially and operationally for our customers. We're optimistic that the execution this year will position us well for continued future growth.
And at this point, I would like to turn the call back to Elise for our first question."

I'm just curious to get your take on how sustainable is the dependence of the company on free cash flow growth from contract duration or more specifically, long-term deferred revenue increase. That's it for me."

We are growing faster than they are, obviously, off of a smaller base so -- but we're -- I think we're performing quite well. After reading that, I feel even better about how we're performing on OpenShift. And so we'll figure what else we can give you on that at Analyst Day, but what I'd say is we're growing faster. We have many, many, many more customers. I will also say they obviously do a top-down traditional sale, where their average customer size, if you just take their revenue and number of customers is 1.5 million. And for an emerging technology, you normally kind of have more of a bubble up, so I don't quite understand that.

Just real quick, contextually, there have only been 2 successful models for monetizing open source. One is the public cloud model, so Amazon runs as a public cloud offering, open source as a service and then Red Hat's model, which is to be a significant contributor and offer on-premise and drive road maps for customers, et cetera, et cetera. So as we look at Kubernetes, we can talk about leadership or not, but if you look at the key people involved, it would be Google, which has the as a service way to monetize it, and Red Hat, which has our enterprise model. I do think public clouds will offer Kubernetes-as-a-service type offerings out there. There is such a far gap between our contribution and #3 that I think it would take somewhat a very long time to build a credible position to offer an on-premise or a hybrid Kubernetes offering. So I never want to say the war is won. We have competitors. But I think we have a very substantial lead in being able to help enterprise customers implement Kubernetes. Beyond Google and Red Hat, it is a far, far distant #3 in terms of contribution and influence on that community. So I do feel like we're in really, really, really good shape there. Relative to Docker, Docker's a different animal, right? So Docker is doing different things. It's now adopted Kubernetes as its approach to orchestrating Docker containers. We certainly also orchestrate Docker form headed containers, but I think we're more open to other types of container formats. So it's hard to compare them directly, so -- but I will say, I don't see Docker in many of the deals that we are involved in. I think they're a little bit more developer focused at this point. So I feel really good about our position across a container platform. Obviously, our position in Kubernetes has put us, I think, at a far lead over everyone else."

So Michael, I mean, one of the things I had in my prepared remarks, I mean, we did see this year some back-end loading of the deals in the fourth quarter closing the last couple weeks, in fact, even some of the last week of the quarter. So as we modeled out this upcoming year, we assumed similar assumptions as we went into both the second half of this year as well as into Q4 specifically. And again, as we've been saying is our deals are getting larger, getting more complex. You can appreciate the fact that with our customers, a lot more procurement organizations are getting involved, and they're -- and it will naturally skew some of this to the back-end part of the quarter. Where linearity is most important in Q4, obviously, is what gets closed in month 1 and month 2. We can certainly collect in month 3. But what's happening is we are seeing more activity closing in month 3, which then the cash flow's collected in the following year. So what I would say is we're assuming very similar trends for this upcoming Q4 as we had this past year. But certainly, we are going to -- we are working with the sales teams to see if we can get some of that activity, pull it out of month 3 into either month 1 or month 2 within the fourth quarter. So what I would say is we had really seen good progress in linearity Q1 through Q3, and then not too terribly unexpected, we saw a little bit of a bigger shift. Again, some of it's because of our year-end. And we would not do any kind of unusual discounting in the end of the year otherwise, so that kind of naturally force some of the stuff to happen in the last month of the quarter. So what I would say, Michael, is we are continuing to work on getting those a little bit more in parity. I do think you'll see improvement in FY '20. We are continuing to see a trail off of some of the cash taxes that we're going to have in this year as well, and then I expect that to taper off a little bit more as we get into FY '20. So I don't think they're going to get exactly in parity in FY '20, but they're going to start closing that gap a little bit more than what you're seeing now."

So we're actually seeing good solid traction beyond telco. Now obviously, telco's big. We had -- we added up 50 material NFV wins with telcos through the course of the year, and those aren't pilots. These are people putting it into production for real workloads. And obviously, a lot of those are in anticipation of 5G. So yes, we're seeing really nice in telco, but I don't want that to overshadow the fact that we're seeing some solid traction in OpenStack. We had 1 big cloud provider, a big 8-figure deal that's using it both for enterprise and for cloud. But just kind of across the board, we're seeing some good solid OpenStack traction."

So it's a bit of both because -- so the OpenShift platform, one of our real strengths is we can run both traditional staple applications and kind of cloud-native applications on the portfolio. So the traditional staple applications can pull Java, EAP, et cetera, out of the middleware portfolio, right. And so as people migrate applications, that migration often is off of WebSphere, WebLogic onto JBoss as the containerized application server on OpenShift. And so we get a lot of attach as people are doing brownfield for the more greenfield cloud native stuff. That's when stuff like BRMS, our rules engine, BPM, Fuse, so our kind of services that you need, whether that's messaging or integration or rules that you do need or API management on a new, more modern application, those get dragged through on the newer stuff. So it's a little bit on both and kind of depends on the use case. And a lot of companies will start with one, like I'm going to do my cloud native stuff, and then they justify and they pay for it by moving the traditional brownfield. But again, it depends a little bit on the customer. But across the board, I mean, once you're building on OpenShift, it does just make it easy, and we make it easy to consume any of the middleware services. And so that's why I think we're seeing a good tailwind there."

So really, the vast, vast majority of the cases, it's kind of replacing DIY, people running scripts and running around with fobs and that kind of stuff.

Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. 
Please note this quarter, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information provided in the supplemental information section of the press release. The adoption of 606 did not, as previously reported, materially impact our total revenues and had no impact on net cash. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 related to the deferral of incremental commissions and other costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Previously, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs and amortized those costs over the contract term. Under the new standard, we are also amortizing related fringe benefit costs over the contract term. These changes are reflected in the current and prior year's results for both GAAP and non-GAAP. 
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our second quarter and full fiscal year FY '19. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect our factor results in the performance of our business which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

We",1176,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as the foundational components of the strategy. We demonstrated this at Red Hat Summit this year where more than 100 customers from around the globe spoke about how they deployed our broad portfolio of technologies to successfully achieve their initiatives and transform their businesses. 
Before I expand on some of the key events from the Red Hat Summit, let me provide you with some highlights in the quarter. We delivered total revenue growth of approximately 20% for the fourth straight quarter in USD. We delivered double-digit core infrastructure growth, while also driving growth in Application Development and other emerging technologies above 30%. This resulted in annualized revenue run rate approaching $800 million, and was particularly strong when considering the ongoing transition of middleware from stand-alone deployments to containerized cloud-based services. 
Our overall growth is being driven by our ability to deliver next-generation platforms to help customers address some of their most pressing challenges that they face when creating, deploying and managing applications that run their businesses. Let me give you a few examples. First, we delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in deals over $1 million, due in part to the fact that 70% of these deals, including one or more components of our group of Application Development related emerging technologies development offerings. 
Second, we showed strong growth in our Linux container platform, OpenShift, where we added over 100 new customers in the quarter and continue to grow median revenue per customer. 
Third, we continued to experience high demand for our services business, which grew 27%. This result was driven by additional consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift. 
A fourth example, we eclipsed the 1,000 customers for our Ansible customers in Q1, up approximately 70% year-over-year. We believe this hybrid momentum around our end-to-end suite of next-generation technologies and related services will enable us to enable us to develop innovation as they develop, deploy and manage applications.
Now let's turn to discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights. Our marquee user event, the Red Hat Summit, was in San Francisco in May. We had record attendance with approximately 7,500 attendees, including developers, IT decision-makers and partners. This was a 20% increase from last year's event. In addition to the high level of customer participation in several technology announcements, we also had some key partner announcements with OpenShift, our container platform. As published in their October 2017 Smarter with Gartner blog, 6 best practices of creating a container platform strategy, Gartner predicts that by 2020, more than 50% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 20% today. Clearly, containers are becoming a major driver for Application Development. is further evident in our announcements, which I'll describe in 2 of the major cloud providers. These are in addition to last year's announcement at summit in Boston where we extended our strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services to further integrate OpenShift, enabling Amazon Web Services within AWS services with OpenShift container platform for hybrid users. 
This year, first, we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to empower enterprise developers to run a container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on-premise environment. With this collaboration, we will introduce the first jointly managed OpenShift offering in the public cloud, combining the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive platform and Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. OpenShift and Azure will be designed to reduce complexity of container management for customers. At the company's preferred offering for hybrid container workloads for our joint customers, Red Hat and Microsoft will manage the solution for customers with support for both companies. 
In addition to being a fully managed service, Red Hat OpenShift on Azure is expected to bring the flexibility to freely move applications between on-premise environments and Azure using OpenShift, which offers a consistent container platform across the hybrid cloud. It will also bring increased productivity by providing a development platform to integrate native quickly and with Azure infrastructure. We're excited about this new offering, which will be available in preview in the coming months. 
The second key partner announcement for Summit for OpenShift was with IBM, where we extended our long-standing collaboration to bring together OpenShift and IBM cloud private with a number of IBM software and cloud solutions. This agreement builds on the recent move of IBM to modernize its software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, series and DB2. Container technologies are increasingly being used as a reliable way to move applications across multiple IT footprints from existing datacenters are private clouds to public clouds and device versa. This collaboration between IBM and Red Hat provides an additional pathway for enterprises to adopt hybrid cloud computing. Through this new agreement, IBM and Red Hat customers can now maximize their existing technology investments and move them more easily to the hybrid cloud with IBM cloud private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation. they can build and deploy Red Hat certified container applications on one single integrated container platform, IBM cloud private, which provides a single view of all enterprise data and enable developers to design, modernize and deploy new applications more quickly, while taking advantage of IBM's cloud-based services such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain with IBM cloud private on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As part of this agreement, IBM will extend its private cloud platforms and middleware offerings to OpenShift as Red Hat-certified containers. This exemplifies the broader transition we are seeing in middleware to the deployments as a service on top of containers. Our dual strength in containers and middleware positions us well to compete in the middleware addressable market that is estimated to reach $18 billion by 2021. 
We have recently announced a series of product app about updates and enhancements to integrate our offering with OpenShift. This allows us to offer our middleware as containerized cloud-based services. We have created a new team focused on this area, and we will update you on our progress to drive additional growth in middleware over the next few quarters. 
In summary, as was on display at Red Hat Summit, customers are deploying hybrid cloud technologies to enable them to compete in this world of digital transformation. We believe Red Hat has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions and partners to be one of the leaders in digital innovation. We worked hard to build a reputation as a trusted brand and modern IT technology and believe we're well positioned to drive growth as we go ahead. 
Before turning this call over, I want to thank all of our global associates, from the team that runs great events like the Red Hat Summit and to every one of Red Hat's 12,000 associates who are focused on our customers every day.
With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities. 
As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the Q1 financial results, we delivered a combination of the following: year-over-year revenue growth of 20% in USD, or 17% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income growth of 19%, and operating cash flow growth of 34%. 
Before I discuss our results in further detail, please note that many of the foreign currencies that we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we provided guidance back in March. For instance, total revenue for the quarter would have been $3 million higher, using the FX rates from March. As for the impact to our full year revenue outlook, we are reaffirming our growth on a constant currency basis of 16% to 17%, while we adjust the dollar range down by $50 million for the changes in FX rates as of today, which I will discuss in more detail at the end of the call. Given this FX volatility in the quarter, I will provide results in both USD and constant currency growth, and you will find a more detailed table of our constant currency results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release. 
Now I will begin with a review of our Q1 performance and business metrics, and then I will move for our outlook for Q2 and FY '19. We delivered $814 million of total revenue for the first quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. Adjusting for the $3 million FX headwind I noted earlier, we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $7 million. The upside was driven primarily by a higher demand for services supporting our emerging technologies. 
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewal constituted 87% of total revenue in Q1 and grew 19% in USD or 16% in constant currency. Double-digit growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $522 million, an increase of 14% in USD year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and emerging technology offerings was $189 million, a year-over-year increase of 37% in USD, or 32% in constant currency. Within this portfolio of solutions, our emerging technologies, which include Ansible, OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and cloud management offerings continue to make strong traction. As we discussed last quarter, the emerging technology performance is somewhat offset by a moderated growth rate for our middleware offerings, as some customers begin to consider shifting their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments. We believe this transition will impact the revenue growth of the middleware business this year, and as such, had previously factored this into our full year guidance provided back in March. We believe that in the long run, as customers shift more applications to container environments, it will benefit our middleware results and Red Hat overall. 
Overall Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 23% of total revenue, up 270 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $102 million grew 27% year-over-year in USD or 24% in constant currency. This impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift offerings. 
Before I move to the income statement, as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for noncash share-based compensation  expenses, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $168 million grew 19% in USD year-over-year and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%. This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than our guidance. As for net other income, it was $4 million for the quarter, in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete tax benefits, was 22.8% for the quarter and lower than our original guidance of 25% due to the U.S. tax reform. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.72, up 24% year-over-year in USD, and above our guidance of $0.68, with the lower tax rate contributing $0.02 to the $0.04 beat. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the traditional cash from incremental repatriation in Q1, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash balance is a 55%-45% split.
Our total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $390 million, up 19% in USD, or 18% in constant currency from the same quarter a year ago. 
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $346 million for the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q1 cash flow performance was a result of strong collections on our Q4 billings, which as we discussed last quarter, was more heavily weighted to February, shifting the collections to this quarter. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 66 days, up 62 -- up from 62 from the prior quarter. 
The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $858 million, up 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was calculated by adding revenue plus the change of deferred revenue on  the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. 
Next, let me discuss our total backlog, which we will now be disclosing on a quarterly basis in our Form 10-Q filing pursuant to the changes of adopting ASC 606. Estimated total backlog was up 21% year-over-year in USD from the prior year quarter for a balance of $3.3 billion in USD. 
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings performance. Looking at our top deals, 25 out of our 25 largest deals that were up for renewal, renewed and did so in aggregate, at greater than 120% of their previous value.  This continues to demonstrate the strong partnership our customers have with Red Hat as they modernize their IT environments.
In addition to our top deals, cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including one or more components from our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Our top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million was our other mainstream vertical, which include sectors such as health care, hospitality and transportation. Our second largest industry vertical was the government. As Jim noted, the growth of deals over $1 million was strong in the quarter with a total of 65 deals, up approximately 48% year-over-year. Within these deals, 6 were greater than $5 million and 1 deal was greater than $10 million, which was 3 less than Q1 last year.
As we discussed at Analyst Day, we're focused on building our strategic partnerships within our mid-market customers. In Q1, our mid-market deals greater than $250,000 increased 138% year-over-year from 21 deals to 50 deals with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. 
Our partnership with Global Systems Integrators is helping to drive growth in the mid-market with these emerging technologies. As for the route to market, 75% was from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force, compared to the prior Q1 split of 72% and 28%. 
Our proxy for bookings duration was just over 21 months,  0.5 month shorter than Q1 last year. Consistent with our talk in Analyst Day, we continue to believe duration will be approximately 1 month shorter for the full fiscal year. The shorter duration is driven in part by an increased focus on our mid-market customers, which typically start out with a shorter subscription duration. As we also highlighted in Analyst Day, there is a smaller base of large customer renewals this year as we increase our strategic partnerships with many of our largest customers back in FY '17. The longer deal duration in FY '17 has enabled us to increase our focus on driving adoption of emerging technologies, which is as I noted earlier, continues to grow at a rapid rate. The shorter deal duration will have an impact on both bookings and billings growth rates in FY '19. 
Lastly, our geographical of bookings mix was 50% from the Americas,28% from EMEA and 22% from Asia Pacific. The percent in Americas was impacted by the large customer renewals we just mentioned. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates. As I discussed at the beginning of my prepared remarks, many of the foreign exchange rates we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we gave guidance in March. 
As a result, for the full year, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.375 billion to $3.410 billion to reflect the $50 million impact from foreign exchange rates as of today. In constant currency growth, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of approximately 16% to 17% at the high end. As a result of the foreign currencies weakening since March, the resulting year-over-year growth in the USD would be approximately 16% to 17%. 
As for other changes to our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our annual effective tax rate was lower than expected, and our planning -- and are now planning for a 22.5% tax rate.
Our full year non-GAAP EPS will increase to approximately $3.44 to $3.48 per share. This also assumes approximately $4  million per quarter for net other income and approximately 185 million diluted shares, which is not include any impact from the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced today. While we are reducing our effective tax rate to 22.5% for FY '19, we believe it will be prudent to continue to use a 25% tax rate in FY '20 and beyond as we continue to evaluate the impact from the U.S. tax reform.
All other previous non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged, including our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% and operating cash flow outlook of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
For Q2, we offer the following outlook. After adjusting for the foreign exchange rate impact of approximately $15 million, we expect revenue to be in the range of $822 million to $830 million, which is up approximately 14% to 15% in both USD and constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 with 185 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable, depending upon individual payments or collections. 
Recapping the quarter, we delivered financial results that are in line with our expectations. We remain confident and focus on partnering with our customers on their journey to adopting our technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. at this point, please open the call up for questions."

And again, I just want to reemphasize that it's not a loss of revenue, it's really a pause as customers are really starting to look at whether they're going to containerize their environment or whether they're going to move to a more contemporary middleware solution. We're working with customers in terms of what does that technical road map look like. We had mentioned this in Analyst Day that we expect this to be several quarters because it is a pretty big technical decision customers have to make. And they're certainly a looking at that, and we expect that to happen over time. And as we look at 606, there is no impact to EPS. And we've provided some supplemental information in our press release, which gives some detailed schedules. And really the biggest changes there are certainly from a restatement standpoint. As Tom had mentioned, we updated the fact that we're now able to amortize the fringe benefits associated with commissions. So that's a big change there, but no impact to EPS."

So the strength is really, as you see that strength, it really is fueled around Ansible and OpenShift. So we're pleased with it. As you think about modeling it out, what I've been saying is certainly, the first half is going to continue to be strong. We may see some of that strength continue into the third quarter. But then, what our plan has been and as we're continuing to get the partner ecosystem really up and running around a lot of these emerging technologies, we're really starting to kind of scale a lot of that out to them.

So DSOs, what I would say is it did pick up a bit, a few days -- 4 days versus last year year-over-year. What that's really a reflection of is we've seen a little bit more business in some of our international countries that have a little bit elongated longer payment terms, which has propped that up a few days. So that's really what's driving that. In terms of linearity, we continue to, and this is something that as we talked about last year all throughout the year, we saw improvements as we went through last year. And then when we got into Q4, we certainly saw a lot more of our business happen in the last month of the quarter, which, as you can appreciate when it happens in last month of the quarter in the last quarter of the year, that's going to certainly flow over from a cash flow perspective into this year, which is what we certainly saw. But as we look at our in-quarter linearity, it's fairly consistent with where it was. Actually, it's actually -- we're seeing a little bit more slide towards the back end of our quarter, our month 3 in this quarter. So we continue to focus in on it. There's been a lot of things that we've done in terms of managing linearity, but it's one of these things to that we're not going to do anything unnatural to close a deal within a particular month in a quarter. But certainly, as the renewals and the renewal rates, we're seeing high renewals happening on time. So depending upon when they're due up, we're pretty confident that we'll see some of those patterns repeat. But nonetheless, linearity is going to be a continued focus for us. But what I would just, as everyone is starting to really model it out, what's the most important linearity from our perspective obviously is what happens in Q4 and how much business happens in the last month of the quarter, because that's really going to determine what gets collected in the next fiscal year, and that's really what we're focused on."

Because as we're working with customers, and as they're starting to look at different options around their technology and updating their infrastructure, a lot of our customers are coming to us increasing the number of different components of our technology within there, so a lot of times will end up re-renewing, and we are certainly going to do that where it makes sense for the customer.

It's a different way to do it. So when someone's [new to] OpenShift, that comes out of RHEL OpenStack is typically sold in a bundle with RHEL, so that's in OpenStack number. So there are a lot of moving pieces around RHEL. So look one quarter, I wouldn't draw too much from it.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the first quarter of 2019. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Eric Shander, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. 
Please note this quarter, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information provided in the supplemental information section of the press release. The adoption of 606 did not, as previously reported, materially impact our total revenues and had no impact on net cash. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 related to the deferral of incremental commissions and other costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Previously, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs and amortized those costs over the contract term. Under the new standard, we are also amortizing related fringe benefit costs over the contract term. These changes are reflected in the current and prior year's results for both GAAP and non-GAAP. 
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our second quarter and full fiscal year FY '19. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect our factor results in the performance of our business which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's call. And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim."

As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as the foundational components of the strategy. We demonstrated this at Red Hat Summit this year where more than 100 customers from around the globe spoke about how they deployed our broad portfolio of technologies to successfully achieve their initiatives and transform their businesses. 
Before I expand on some of the key events from the Red Hat Summit, let me provide you with some highlights in the quarter. We delivered total revenue growth of approximately 20% for the fourth straight quarter in USD. We delivered double-digit core infrastructure growth, while also driving growth in Application Development and other emerging technologies above 30%. This resulted in annualized revenue run rate approaching $800 million, and was particularly strong when considering the ongoing transition of middleware from stand-alone deployments to containerized cloud-based services. 
Our overall growth is being driven by our ability to deliver next-generation platforms to help customers address some of their most pressing challenges that they face when creating, deploying and managing applications that run their businesses. Let me give you a few examples. First, we delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in deals over $1 million, due in part to the fact that 70% of these deals, including one or more components of our group of Application Development related emerging technologies development offerings. 
Second, we showed strong growth in our Linux container platform, OpenShift, where we added over 100 new customers in the quarter and continue to grow median revenue per customer. 
Third, we continued to experience high demand for our services business, which grew 27%. This result was driven by additional consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift. 
A fourth example, we eclipsed the 1,000 customers for our Ansible customers in Q1, up approximately 70% year-over-year. We believe this hybrid momentum around our end-to-end suite of next-generation technologies and related services will enable us to enable us to develop innovation as they develop, deploy and manage applications.
Now let's turn to discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights. Our marquee user event, the Red Hat Summit, was in San Francisco in May. We had record attendance with approximately 7,500 attendees, including developers, IT decision-makers and partners. This was a 20% increase from last year's event. In addition to the high level of customer participation in several technology announcements, we also had some key partner announcements with OpenShift, our container platform. As published in their October 2017 Smarter with Gartner blog, 6 best practices of creating a container platform strategy, Gartner predicts that by 2020, more than 50% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 20% today. Clearly, containers are becoming a major driver for Application Development. is further evident in our announcements, which I'll describe in 2 of the major cloud providers. These are in addition to last year's announcement at summit in Boston where we extended our strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services to further integrate OpenShift, enabling Amazon Web Services within AWS services with OpenShift container platform for hybrid users. 
This year, first, we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to empower enterprise developers to run a container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on-premise environment. With this collaboration, we will introduce the first jointly managed OpenShift offering in the public cloud, combining the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive platform and Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. OpenShift and Azure will be designed to reduce complexity of container management for customers. At the company's preferred offering for hybrid container workloads for our joint customers, Red Hat and Microsoft will manage the solution for customers with support for both companies. 
In addition to being a fully managed service, Red Hat OpenShift on Azure is expected to bring the flexibility to freely move applications between on-premise environments and Azure using OpenShift, which offers a consistent container platform across the hybrid cloud. It will also bring increased productivity by providing a development platform to integrate native quickly and with Azure infrastructure. We're excited about this new offering, which will be available in preview in the coming months. 
The second key partner announcement for Summit for OpenShift was with IBM, where we extended our long-standing collaboration to bring together OpenShift and IBM cloud private with a number of IBM software and cloud solutions. This agreement builds on the recent move of IBM to modernize its software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, series and DB2. Container technologies are increasingly being used as a reliable way to move applications across multiple IT footprints from existing datacenters are private clouds to public clouds and device versa. This collaboration between IBM and Red Hat provides an additional pathway for enterprises to adopt hybrid cloud computing. Through this new agreement, IBM and Red Hat customers can now maximize their existing technology investments and move them more easily to the hybrid cloud with IBM cloud private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation. they can build and deploy Red Hat certified container applications on one single integrated container platform, IBM cloud private, which provides a single view of all enterprise data and enable developers to design, modernize and deploy new applications more quickly, while taking advantage of IBM's cloud-based services such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain with IBM cloud private on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As part of this agreement, IBM will extend its private cloud platforms and middleware offerings to OpenShift as Red Hat-certified containers. This exemplifies the broader transition we are seeing in middleware to the deployments as a service on top of containers. Our dual strength in containers and middleware positions us well to compete in the middleware addressable market that is estimated to reach $18 billion by 2021. 
We have recently announced a series of product app about updates and enhancements to integrate our offering with OpenShift. This allows us to offer our middleware as containerized cloud-based services. We have created a new team focused on this area, and we will update you on our progress to drive additional growth in middleware over the next few quarters. 
In summary, as was on display at Red Hat Summit, customers are deploying hybrid cloud technologies to enable them to compete in this world of digital transformation. We believe Red Hat has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions and partners to be one of the leaders in digital innovation. We worked hard to build a reputation as a trusted brand and modern IT technology and believe we're well positioned to drive growth as we go ahead. 
Before turning this call over, I want to thank all of our global associates, from the team that runs great events like the Red Hat Summit and to every one of Red Hat's 12,000 associates who are focused on our customers every day.
With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities. As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid clo",1827,"Thank you, Jim. Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities. 
As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the Q1 financial results, we delivered a combination of the following: year-over-year revenue growth of 20% in USD, or 17% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income growth of 19%, and operating cash flow growth of 34%. 
Before I discuss our results in further detail, please note that many of the foreign currencies that we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we provided guidance back in March. For instance, total revenue for the quarter would have been $3 million higher, using the FX rates from March. As for the impact to our full year revenue outlook, we are reaffirming our growth on a constant currency basis of 16% to 17%, while we adjust the dollar range down by $50 million for the changes in FX rates as of today, which I will discuss in more detail at the end of the call. Given this FX volatility in the quarter, I will provide results in both USD and constant currency growth, and you will find a more detailed table of our constant currency results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release. 
Now I will begin with a review of our Q1 performance and business metrics, and then I will move for our outlook for Q2 and FY '19. We delivered $814 million of total revenue for the first quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. Adjusting for the $3 million FX headwind I noted earlier, we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $7 million. The upside was driven primarily by a higher demand for services supporting our emerging technologies. 
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewal constituted 87% of total revenue in Q1 and grew 19% in USD or 16% in constant currency. Double-digit growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $522 million, an increase of 14% in USD year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and emerging technology offerings was $189 million, a year-over-year increase of 37% in USD, or 32% in constant currency. Within this portfolio of solutions, our emerging technologies, which include Ansible, OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and cloud management offerings continue to make strong traction. As we discussed last quarter, the emerging technology performance is somewhat offset by a moderated growth rate for our middleware offerings, as some customers begin to consider shifting their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments. We believe this transition will impact the revenue growth of the middleware business this year, and as such, had previously factored this into our full year guidance provided back in March. We believe that in the long run, as customers shift more applications to container environments, it will benefit our middleware results and Red Hat overall. 
Overall Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 23% of total revenue, up 270 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $102 million grew 27% year-over-year in USD or 24% in constant currency. This impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift offerings. 
Before I move to the income statement, as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for noncash share-based compensation  expenses, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $168 million grew 19% in USD year-over-year and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%. This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than our guidance. As for net other income, it was $4 million for the quarter, in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete tax benefits, was 22.8% for the quarter and lower than our original guidance of 25% due to the U.S. tax reform. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.72, up 24% year-over-year in USD, and above our guidance of $0.68, with the lower tax rate contributing $0.02 to the $0.04 beat. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the traditional cash from incremental repatriation in Q1, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash balance is a 55%-45% split.
Our total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $390 million, up 19% in USD, or 18% in constant currency from the same quarter a year ago. 
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $346 million for the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q1 cash flow performance was a result of strong collections on our Q4 billings, which as we discussed last quarter, was more heavily weighted to February, shifting the collections to this quarter. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 66 days, up 62 -- up from 62 from the prior quarter. 
The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $858 million, up 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was calculated by adding revenue plus the change of deferred revenue on  the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. 
Next, let me discuss our total backlog, which we will now be disclosing on a quarterly basis in our Form 10-Q filing pursuant to the changes of adopting ASC 606. Estimated total backlog was up 21% year-over-year in USD from the prior year quarter for a balance of $3.3 billion in USD. 
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings performance. Looking at our top deals, 25 out of our 25 largest deals that were up for renewal, renewed and did so in aggregate, at greater than 120% of their previous value.  This continues to demonstrate the strong partnership our customers have with Red Hat as they modernize their IT environments.
In addition to our top deals, cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including one or more components from our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Our top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million was our other mainstream vertical, which include sectors such as health care, hospitality and transportation. Our second largest industry vertical was the government. As Jim noted, the growth of deals over $1 million was strong in the quarter with a total of 65 deals, up approximately 48% year-over-year. Within these deals, 6 were greater than $5 million and 1 deal was greater than $10 million, which was 3 less than Q1 last year.
As we discussed at Analyst Day, we're focused on building our strategic partnerships within our mid-market customers. In Q1, our mid-market deals greater than $250,000 increased 138% year-over-year from 21 deals to 50 deals with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. 
Our partnership with Global Systems Integrators is helping to drive growth in the mid-market with these emerging technologies. As for the route to market, 75% was from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force, compared to the prior Q1 split of 72% and 28%. 
Our proxy for bookings duration was just over 21 months,  0.5 month shorter than Q1 last year. Consistent with our talk in Analyst Day, we continue to believe duration will be approximately 1 month shorter for the full fiscal year. The shorter duration is driven in part by an increased focus on our mid-market customers, which typically start out with a shorter subscription duration. As we also highlighted in Analyst Day, there is a smaller base of large customer renewals this year as we increase our strategic partnerships with many of our largest customers back in FY '17. The longer deal duration in FY '17 has enabled us to increase our focus on driving adoption of emerging technologies, which is as I noted earlier, continues to grow at a rapid rate. The shorter deal duration will have an impact on both bookings and billings growth rates in FY '19. 
Lastly, our geographical of bookings mix was 50% from the Americas,28% from EMEA and 22% from Asia Pacific. The percent in Americas was impacted by the large customer renewals we just mentioned. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates. As I discussed at the beginning of my prepared remarks, many of the foreign exchange rates we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we gave guidance in March. 
As a result, for the full year, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.375 billion to $3.410 billion to reflect the $50 million impact from foreign exchange rates as of today. In constant currency growth, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of approximately 16% to 17% at the high end. As a result of the foreign currencies weakening since March, the resulting year-over-year growth in the USD would be approximately 16% to 17%. 
As for other changes to our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our annual effective tax rate was lower than expected, and our planning -- and are now planning for a 22.5% tax rate.
Our full year non-GAAP EPS will increase to approximately $3.44 to $3.48 per share. This also assumes approximately $4  million per quarter for net other income and approximately 185 million diluted shares, which is not include any impact from the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced today. While we are reducing our effective tax rate to 22.5% for FY '19, we believe it will be prudent to continue to use a 25% tax rate in FY '20 and beyond as we continue to evaluate the impact from the U.S. tax reform.
All other previous non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged, including our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% and operating cash flow outlook of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
For Q2, we offer the following outlook. After adjusting for the foreign exchange rate impact of approximately $15 million, we expect revenue to be in the range of $822 million to $830 million, which is up approximately 14% to 15% in both USD and constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 with 185 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable, depending upon individual payments or collections. 
Recapping the quarter, we delivered financial results that are in line with our expectations. We remain confident and focus on partnering with our customers on their journey to adopting our technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. at this point, please open the call up for questions."

We're working with customers in terms of what does that technical road map look like. We had mentioned this in Analyst Day that we expect this to be several quarters because it is a pretty big technical decision customers have to make. And they're certainly a looking at that, and we expect that to happen over time. And as we look at 606, there is no impact to EPS.

So the strength is really, as you see that strength, it really is fueled around Ansible and OpenShift. So we're pleased with it. As you think about modeling it out, what I've been saying is certainly, the first half is going to continue to be strong. We may see some of that strength continue into the third quarter. But then, what our plan has been and as we're continuing to get the partner ecosystem really up and running around a lot of these emerging technologies, we're really starting to kind of scale a lot of that out to them.

So DSOs, what I would say is it did pick up a bit, a few days -- 4 days versus last year year-over-year. What that's really a reflection of is we've seen a little bit more business in some of our international countries that have a little bit elongated longer payment terms, which has propped that up a few days. So that's really what's driving that. In terms of linearity, we continue to, and this is something that as we talked about last year all throughout the year, we saw improvements as we went through last year. And then when we got into Q4, we certainly saw a lot more of our business happen in the last month of the quarter, which, as you can appreciate when it happens in last month of the quarter in the last quarter of the year, that's going to certainly flow over from a cash flow perspective into this year, which is what we certainly saw. But as we look at our in-quarter linearity, it's fairly consistent with where it was. Actually, it's actually -- we're seeing a little bit more slide towards the back end of our quarter, our month 3 in this quarter. So we continue to focus in on it. There's been a lot of things that we've done in terms of managing linearity, but it's one of these things to that we're not going to do anything unnatural to close a deal within a particular month in a quarter. But certainly, as the renewals and the renewal rates, we're seeing high renewals happening on time. So depending upon when they're due up, we're pretty confident that we'll see some of those patterns repeat. But nonetheless, linearity is going to be a continued focus for us. But what I would just, as everyone is starting to really model it out, what's the most important linearity from our perspective obviously is what happens in Q4 and how much business happens in the last month of the quarter, because that's really going to determine what gets collected in the next fiscal year, and that's really what we're focused on."

They're clearly getting some traction, and it's one we need to try to make sure we get visibility into all of those. But typically, when we have an opportunity to compete, we win.

It's a different way to do it. So when someone's [new to] OpenShift, that comes out of RHEL OpenStack is typically sold in a bundle with RHEL, so that's in OpenStack number. So there are a lot of moving pieces around RHEL. So look one quarter, I wouldn't draw too much from it.

The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 related to the deferral of incremental commissions and other costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Previously, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs and amortized those costs over the contract term. Under the new standard, we are also amortizing related fringe benefit costs over the contract term. These changes are reflected in the current and prior year's results for both GAAP and non-GAAP.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our second quarter and full fiscal year FY '19. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business, which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's call.
And with that, let me turn it over to Jim."

As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as the foundational components of this strategy. We",1192,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as the foundational components of this strategy. We demonstrated this at the Red Hat Summit this year, where more than 100 customers from around the globe spoke about how they deployed our broad portfolio of technologies to successfully achieve their initiatives and transform their businesses.
Before I expand on some of the key events from the Red Hat Summit, let me provide you with some highlights in the quarter. We delivered total revenue growth of approximately 20% for the fourth straight quarter in USD. We delivered double-digit core infrastructure growth while also driving growth in Application Development and other emerging technologies above 30%. This resulted in annualized revenue run rate approaching $800 million and was particularly strong when considering the ongoing transition of middleware from stand-alone deployments to containerized cloud-based services.
Our overall growth is being driven by our ability to deliver next-generation platforms to help customers address some of their most pressing challenges that they face when creating, deploying and managing applications that run their businesses. Let me give you a few examples. First, we delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in deals over $1 million, due in part to the fact that 70% of these deals, including 1 or more components of our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies development offerings. Second, we drove strong growth in our Linux container platform, OpenShift, where we added over 100 new customers in the quarter and continue to grow median revenue per customer. Third, we continued to experience high demand for our services business, which grew 27%. This result was driven by additional consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift. A fourth example, we eclipsed 1,000 customers for our Ansible subscribers in Q1, up approximately 70% year-over-year. We believe this type of momentum around our end-to-end suite of next-generation technologies and related services will enable us to deliver choice and innovation for our customers as they develop, deploy and manage their applications.
Now let's turn to discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights. Our marquee user event, the Red Hat Summit, was held in San Francisco in May. We had record attendance with approximately 7,500 attendees, including developers, IT decision-makers and partners. This was a 20% increase from last year's event. In addition to the high level of customer participation and several technology announcements, we also had some key partner announcements with OpenShift, our container platform. As published in their October 2017 Smarter with Gartner blog, 6 best practices for creating a container platform strategy, Gartner predicts that by 2020 more than 50% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 20% today.
Clearly, containers are becoming a major driver for Application Development. This is further evident in our announcements, which I'll describe, between Red Hat and 2 of the major cloud providers. These are in addition to last year's announcement at Summit in Boston, where we extended our strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services to further integrate OpenShift, enabling Amazon Web Services within -- AWS services within OpenShift Container Platform for hybrid users.
This year, first, we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to empower enterprise developers to run container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on-premise environments. With this collaboration, we will introduce the first jointly managed OpenShift offering in the public cloud, combining the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform and Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. OpenShift on Azure will be configured and designed to reduce the complexity of container management for customers. As the company's preferred offering for hybrid container workloads for our joint customers, Red Hat and Microsoft will manage this solution for customers with support from both companies.
In addition to being a fully managed service, Red Hat OpenShift on Azure is expected to bring enterprise developers the flexibility to freely move applications between both on-premise environments and Azure using OpenShift, which offers a consistent container platform across the hybrid cloud. It will also bring increased productivity by providing a development platform that integrates natively with Azure infrastructure. We're excited about this new offering, which will be available in preview in the coming months.
The second key partner announcement from Summit for OpenShift was with IBM, where we extended our long-standing collaboration to bring together OpenShift and IBM Cloud Private with a number of IBM software and cloud solutions. This agreement builds on the recent move by IBM to modernize its software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, MQ Series and DB2. Container technologies are increasingly being used as a reliable way to move applications across multiple IT footprints from existing data centers or private clouds to public cloud and vice versa. This collaboration between IBM and Red Hat provides an additional pathway for enterprises to adopt hybrid cloud computing.
Through this new agreement, IBM and Red Hat customers can now maximize their existing technology investments and move them more easily to the hybrid cloud with IBM Cloud Private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation. They can build and deploy Red Hat-certified container applications on one single integrated container platform, IBM Cloud Private, which provides a single view of all enterprise data, and enable developers to design, modernize and deploy new applications more quickly while taking advantage of IBM's cloud-based services such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain with IBM Cloud Private on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As part of this agreement, IBM will extend its private cloud platforms and middleware offerings to OpenShift as Red Hat-certified containers. This exemplifies the broader transition we are seeing in middleware to deployments as a service on top of containers. Our dual strength in containers and middleware positions us well to compete in the middleware addressable market that is estimated to reach $18 billion by 2021.
We have recently announced a series of product updates and enhancements to integrate our offerings more closely with OpenShift. This allows us to offer our middleware as containerized cloud-based services. We have created a new team focused on this area, and we will update you on our progress to drive additional growth in middleware over the next few quarters.
In summary, as was on display at Red Hat Summit, customers are deploying hybrid cloud technologies to enable them to compete in this world of digital transformation. We believe Red Hat has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions and partners to be one of the leaders in digital innovation. We've worked hard to build a reputation as a trusted brand and modern IT technology and believe we are well positioned to drive growth as we look ahead.
Before turning this call over, I want to thank all of our global associates, from the team that runs great events like the Red Hat Summit and to every 1 of Red Hat's 12,000 associates that are focused on our customers every day. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities.
As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the Q1 financial results, we delivered a combination of the following: year-over-year revenue growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 19% and operating cash flow growth of 34%.
Before I discuss our results in further detail, please note that many of the foreign currencies that we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we provided guidance back in March. For instance, total revenue for the quarter would have been $3 million higher using the FX rates from March. As for the impact to our full year revenue outlook, we are reaffirming the growth on a constant currency basis of 16% to 17%, while we adjust the dollar range down by $50 million for the changes in FX rates as of today, which I will discuss in more detail at the end of the call. Given this FX volatility in the quarter, I will provide results in both USD and constant currency growth, and you will find a more detailed table of our constant currency results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
Now I will begin with a review of our Q1 performance and business metrics, and then I will move to our outlook for Q2 and FY '19. We delivered $814 million of total revenue for the first quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. Adjusting for the $3 million FX headwind I noted earlier, we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $7 million. The upside was driven primarily by a higher demand for services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 87% of total revenue in Q1 and grew 19% in USD or 16% in constant currency. Double-digit growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $522 million, an increase of 14% in USD year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and emerging technology offerings was $189 million, a year-over-year increase of 37% in USD or 32% in constant currency. Within this portfolio of solutions, our emerging technologies, which include Ansible, OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and cloud management offerings continue to make strong traction. As we discussed last quarter, the emerging technology performance is somewhat offset by a moderated growth rate for our middleware offerings, as some customers begin to consider shifting their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments. We believe this transition will impact the revenue growth of the middleware business this year and as such, had previously factored this into our full year guidance provided back in March. We believe that, in the long run, as customers shift more applications to container environments, it will benefit our middleware results and Red Hat overall.
Overall Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 23% of total revenue, up 270 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $102 million grew 27% year-over-year in USD or 24% in constant currency. This impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
Before I move to the income statement, as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for non-cash share-based compensation  expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $168 million grew 19% in USD year-over-year and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%. This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than our guidance. As for net other income, it was $4 million for the quarter, in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete tax benefits, was 22.8% for the quarter and lower than our original guidance of 25% due to the U.S. tax reform. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.72, up 24% year-over-year in USD and above our guidance of $0.68 with the lower tax rate contributing $0.02 to the $0.04 beat.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from incremental repatriation in Q1, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash balance is a 55%-45% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $390 million, up 19% in USD or 18% in constant currency for the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $346 million for the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q1 cash flow performance was the result of strong collections on our Q4 billings, which, as we discussed last quarter, was more heavily weighted to February, shifting the collections to this quarter. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 66 days, up 62 -- up from 62 in the prior year quarter.
The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $858 million, up 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our total backlog, which we will now be disclosing on a quarterly basis in our Form 10-Q filing pursuant to the changes of adopting ASC 606. Estimated total backlog was up 21% year-over-year in USD from the prior year quarter for a balance of $3.3 billion in USD.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings performance. Looking at our top deals, 25 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. This continues to demonstrate the strong partnership our customers have with Red Hat as they modernize their IT environments.
In addition to our top deals, cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Our top industry vertical within the deals greater than $1 million was our other mainstream vertical, which includes sectors such as health care, hospitality and transportation. Our second largest industry vertical was the government. As Jim noted, the growth of deals over $1 million was strong in the quarter with a total of 65 deals, up approximately 48% year-over-year. Within these deals, 6 were greater than $5 million and 1 deal was greater than $10 million, which was 3 less than Q1 last year.
As we discussed at Analyst Day, we are focused on building our strategic partnerships within our mid-market customers. In Q1, our mid-market deals greater than $250,000 increased 138% year-over-year from 21 deals to 50 deals with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. Our partnership with global systems integrators is helping to drive growth in the mid-market with these emerging technologies. As for the route to market, 75% was from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force compared to the prior Q1 split of 72% and 28%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was just over 21 months, 0.5 month shorter than Q1 last year. Consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day, we continue to believe duration will be approximately 1 month shorter for the full fiscal year. The shorter duration is driven in part by an increased focus on our mid-market customers, which typically start out with a shorter subscription duration. As we also highlighted in Analyst Day, there is a smaller base of large customer renewal this year as we increase our strategic partnerships with many of our largest customers back in FY '17. The longer deal duration in FY '17 has enabled us to increase our focus on driving adoption of emerging technologies, which, as I noted earlier, continues to grow at a rapid rate. The shorter deal duration will have an impact on both bookings and billings growth rates in FY '19.
Lastly, our geographical bookings mix was 50% from the Americas, 28% from EMEA and 22% from Asia Pacific. The percent in Americas was impacted by the smaller base of large customer renewals we just mentioned.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates. As I discussed at the beginning of my prepared remarks, many of the foreign exchange rates we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we gave guidance in March. As a result, for the full year, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.375 billion to $3.410 billion to reflect the $50 million impact from foreign exchange rates as of today. In constant currency growth, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of approximately 16% to 17% at the high end. As a result of the foreign currencies weakening since March, the resulting year-over-year growth in USD would be approximately 16% to 17%.  As for other changes to our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our annual effective tax rate was lower than expected and our planning -- and are now planning for a 22.5% tax rate.
Our full year non-GAAP EPS will increase to approximately $3.44 to $3.48 per share. This also assumes approximately $4  million per quarter for net other income and approximately 185 million diluted shares, which does not include any impact from the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced today. While we are reducing our effective tax rate to 22.5% for FY '19, we believe it will be prudent to continue to use a 25% tax rate in FY '20 and beyond as we continue to evaluate the impact from the U.S. tax reform. All other previous non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged, including our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% and operating cash flow outlook of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
For Q2, we offer the following outlook. After adjusting for the foreign exchange rate impact of approximately $15 million, we expect revenue to be in the range of $822 million to $830 million, which is up approximately 14% to 15% in both USD and constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 with 185 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable, depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping the quarter. We delivered financial results that were in line with our expectations. We remain confident and focused on partnering with our customers on their journey to adopting our technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing.
Elise, at this point, please open the call up for questions."

It's really a pause as customers are really starting to look at whether they're going to containerize their environments or are they going to move to a more contemporary middleware solution. We're working with customers in terms of what does that technical road map look like. We had mentioned this in Analyst Day that we expect this to be several quarters because it is a pretty big technical decision that customers have to make. And they're certainly looking at that, and we expect that to happen over time. And then as we look at 606, there is no impact to EPS. And we've provided some supplemental information in our press release, which gives some detailed schedules. And really, the biggest change there certainly from a restatement standpoint is, as Tom had mentioned, we updated the fact that we're now able to amortize the fringe benefits associated with commissions. So that's the big change there, but no impact to EPS."

As you think about modeling it out, what I've been saying is certainly, the first half is going to continue to be strong. We may see some of that strength continue into the third quarter, but then what our plan has been and as we're continuing to get the partner ecosystem really up and running around a lot of these emerging technologies, we're really starting to kind of scale a lot of that out to them.

So DSOs, what I would say is it did pick up a bit few days -- 4 days versus last year, year-over-year. What that's really a reflection of is we've seen a little bit more business in some of our international countries that have a little bit elongated longer payment terms, which has propped that up a few days. So that's really what's driving that. In terms of linearity, we continue to -- and this is something that as we talked about last year all throughout the year, we saw improvements as we went through last year. And then when we got into Q4, we certainly saw a lot more of our business happen in the last month of the quarter, which, as you can appreciate, when it happens in the last month of the quarter, in the last quarter of the year, that's going to certainly flow over from a cash flow perspective into this year, which is what we certainly saw. But as we look at our in-quarter linearity, it's fairly consistent with where it was. Actually, it's actually -- we're seeing a little bit more slide towards the back end of our quarter, our month 3 in this quarter. So we continue to focus in on it. There's been a lot of things that we've done in terms of managing linearity, but it's one of these things, too, where we're not going to do anything unnatural to close a deal within a particular month in a quarter. But certainly, as the renewals and the renewal rates, we're seeing high renewals happening on time. So depending upon when they're due up, we're pretty confident that we'll see some of those patterns repeat. But nonetheless, linearity is going to be a continued focus for us. But what I would just, as everyone is starting to really model it out, what's the most important linearity from our perspective obviously is what happens in Q4 and how much business happens in the last month of the quarter because that's really going to determine what gets collected in the next fiscal year. And that's really what we're focused in on."

It's a different way to do it. So when someone moves to OpenShift, that comes out of RHEL. OpenStack is typically sold in a bundle with RHEL, and so that's in the OpenStack number. So there are a lot of moving pieces around RHEL. So look 1 quarter, I wouldn't draw too much from it.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal '19. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Eric Shander, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics, along with our earnings release, included in -- including in that is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. 
Please note, this quarter, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information provided in the supplemental information section of the press release. The adoption of 606 did not, as previously reported, materially impact our total revenues and had no impact on net cash. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 related to the deferral of incremental commissions and other costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Previously, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs and amortized those costs over the contract term. Under the new standard, we are also amortizing related fringe benefit costs over the contract term. These changes are reflected in the current and prior year's results for both GAAP and non-GAAP.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our second quarter and full fiscal year FY '19. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business, which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as one of the foundational components of this strategy. We demonstrated this at the Red Hat Summit this year, where more than 100 customers from around the globe spoke about how they deployed our broad portfolio of technologies to successfully achieve their initiatives and transform their businesses.
Before I expand on some of the key events from the Red Hat Summit, let me provide you with some highlights in the quarter. We delivered total revenue growth of approximately 20% for the fourth straight quarter in USD. We delivered double-digit core infrastructure growth while also driving growth in Application Development and other emerging technologies above 30%. This resulted in annualized revenue run rate approaching $800 million and was particularly strong when considering the ongoing transition of middleware from stand-alone deployments to containerized cloud-based services.
Our overall growth is being driven by our ability to deliver next-generation platforms to help customers address some of their most pressing challenges that they face when creating, deploying and managing applications that run their businesses. Let me give you a few examples. First, we delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in deals over $1 million, due in part to the fact that 70% of these deals, including 1 or more components of our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Second, we drove strong growth in our Linux container platform, OpenShift, where we added over 100 new customers in the quarter and continue to grow median revenue per customer. Third, we continued to experience high demand for our services business, which grew 27%. This result was driven by additional consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift. A fourth example, we eclipsed 1,000 customers for our Ansible subscribers in Q1, up approximately 70% year-over-year. We believe this type of momentum around our end-to-end suite of next-generation technologies and related services will enable us to deliver choice and innovation for our customers as they develop, deploy and manage their applications.
Now let's turn to discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights. Our marquee user event, the Red Hat Summit, was held in San Francisco in May. We had record attendance with approximately 7,500 attendees, including developers, IT decision-makers and partners. This was a 20% increase from last year's event. In addition to the high level of customer participation and several technology announcements, we also had some key partner announcements with OpenShift, our container platform. As published in their October 2017 Smarter with Gartner blog, 6 best practices for creating a container platform strategy, Gartner predicts that by 2020 more than 50% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 20% today.
Clearly, containers are becoming a major driver for Application Development. This is further evident in our announcements, which I'll describe, between Red Hat and 2 of the major public cloud providers. These are in addition to last year's announcement at Summit in Boston, where we extended our strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services to further integrate OpenShift, enabling Amazon Web Services within -- AWS services within OpenShift Container Platform for hybrid users.
This year, first, we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to empower enterprise developers to run container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on-premise environments. With this collaboration, we will introduce the first jointly managed OpenShift offering in the public cloud, combining the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform and Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. OpenShift on Azure will be configured and designed to reduce the complexity of container management for customers. As the company's preferred offering for hybrid container workflows for our joint customers, Red Hat and Microsoft will manage this solution for customers with support from both companies.
In addition to being a fully managed service, Red Hat OpenShift on Azure is expected to bring enterprise developers the flexibility to freely move applications between both on-premise environments and Azure using OpenShift, which offers a consistent container platform across the hybrid cloud. It will also bring increased productivity by providing a development platform that integrates natively with Azure infrastructure. We're excited about this new offering, which will be available in preview in the coming months.
The second key partner announcement from Summit for OpenShift was with IBM, where we extended our long-standing collaboration to bring together OpenShift and IBM Cloud Private with a number of IBM software and cloud solutions. This agreement builds on the recent move by IBM to modernize its software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, MQ Series and DB2. Container technologies are increasingly being used as a reliable way to move applications across multiple IT footprints from existing data centers or private clouds to public cloud and vice versa. This collaboration between IBM and Red Hat provides an additional pathway for enterprises to adopt hybrid cloud computing.
Through this new agreement, IBM and Red Hat customers can now maximize their existing technology investments and move them more easily to the hybrid cloud with IBM Cloud Private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation. They can build and deploy Red Hat-certified container applications on one single integrated container platform, IBM Cloud Private, which provides a single view of all enterprise data, and enable developers to design, modernize and deploy new applications more quickly while taking advantage of IBM's cloud-based services such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain with IBM Cloud Private on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As part of this agreement, IBM will extend its private cloud platforms and middleware offerings to OpenShift as Red Hat-certified containers. This exemplifies the broader transition we are seeing in middleware to deployments as a service on top of containers. Our dual strength in containers and middleware positions us well to compete in the middleware addressable market that is estimated to reach $18 billion by 2021.
We have recently announced a series of product updates and enhancements to integrate our offerings more closely with OpenShift. This allows us to offer our middleware as containerized cloud-based services. We have created a new team focused on this area, and we will update you on our progress to drive additional growth in middleware over the next few quarters.
In summary, as was on display at Red Hat Summit, customers are deploying hybrid cloud technologies to enable them to compete in this world of digital transformation. We believe Red Hat has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions and partners to be one of the leaders in digital innovation. We've worked hard to build a reputation as a trusted brand and modern IT technology and believe we are well positioned to drive growth as we look ahead.
Before turning this call over, I want to thank all of our global associates, from the team that runs great events like the Red Hat Summit and to every 1 of Red Hat's 12,000 associates that are focused on our customers every day. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities.
As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the Q1 financial results, we delivered a combination of the following: year-over-year revenue growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 19% and operating cash flow growth of 34%.
Before I discuss our results in further detail, please note that many of the foreign currencies that we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we provided guidance back in March. For instance, total revenue for the quarter would have been $3 million higher using the FX rates from March. As for the impact to our full year revenue outlook, we are reaffirming the growth on a constant currency basis of 16% to 17%, while we adjust the dollar range down by $50 million for the changes in FX rates as of today, which I will discuss in more detail at the end of the call. Given this FX volatility in the quarter, I will provide results in both USD and constant currency growth, and you will find a more detailed table of our constant currency results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
Now I will begin with a review of our Q1 performance and business metrics, and then I will move to our outlook for Q2 and FY '19. We delivered $814 million of total revenue for the first quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. Adjusting for the $3 million FX headwind I noted earlier, we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $7 million. The upside was driven primarily by a higher demand for services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 87% of total revenue in Q1 and grew 19% in USD or 16% in constant currency. Double-digit growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $522 million, an increase of 14% in USD year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and emerging technology offerings was $189 million, a year-over-year increase of 37% in USD or 32% in constant currency. Within this portfolio of solutions, our emerging technologies, which include Ansible, OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and cloud management offerings continue to make strong traction. As we discussed last quarter, the emerging technology performance is somewhat offset by a moderated growth rate for our middleware offerings, as some customers begin to consider shifting their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments. We believe this transition will impact the revenue growth of the middleware business this year and as such, had previously factored this into our full year guidance provided back in March. We believe that, in the long run, as customers shift more applications to container environments, it will benefit our middleware results and Red Hat overall.
Overall Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 23% of total revenue, up 270 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $102 million grew 27% year-over-year in USD or 24% in constant currency. This impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
Before I move to the income statement, as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for non-cash share-based compensation  expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $168 million grew 19% in USD year-over-year and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%. This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than our guidance. As for net other income, it was $4 million for the quarter, in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete tax benefits, was 22.8% for the quarter and lower than our original guidance of 25% due to the U.S. tax reform. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.72, up 24% year-over-year in USD and above our guidance of $0.68 with the lower tax rate contributing $0.02 to the $0.04 beat.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from incremental repatriation in Q1, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash balance is a 55%-45% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $390 million, up 19% in USD or 18% in constant currency for the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $346 million for the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q1 cash flow performance was the result of strong collections on our Q4 billings, which, as we discussed last quarter, was more heavily weighted to February, shifting the collections to this quarter. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 66 days, up 62 -- up from 62 in the prior year quarter.
The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $858 million, up 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our total backlog, which we will now be disclosing on a quarterly basis in our Form 10-Q filing pursuant to the changes of adopting ASC 606. Estimated total backlog was up 21% year-over-year in USD from the prior year quarter for a balance of $3.3 billion in USD.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings performance. Looking at our top deals, 25 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. This continues to demonstrate the strong partnership our customers have with Red Hat as they modernize their IT environments.
In addition to our top deals, cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including 1 or more components from our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Our top industry vertical within the deals greater than $1 million was our other mainstream vertical, which includes sectors such as health care, hospitality and transportation. Our second largest industry vertical was the government. As Jim noted, the growth of deals over $1 million was strong in the quarter with a total of 65 deals, up approximately 48% year-over-year. Within these deals, 6 were greater than $5 million and 1 deal was greater than $10 million, which was 3 less than Q1 last year.
As we discussed at Analyst Day, we are focused on building our strategic partnerships within our mid-market customers. In Q1, our mid-market deals greater than $250,000 increased 138% year-over-year from 21 deals to 50 deals with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. Our partnership with global systems integrators is helping to drive growth in the mid-market with these emerging technologies. As for the route to market, 75% was from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force compared to the prior Q1 split of 72% and 28%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was just over 21 months, 0.5 month shorter than Q1 last year. Consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day, we continue to believe duration will be approximately 1 month shorter for the full fiscal year. The shorter duration is driven in part by an increased focus on our mid-market customers, which typically start out with a shorter subscription duration. As we also highlighted in Analyst Day, there is a smaller base of large customer renewal this year as we increase our strategic partnerships with many of our largest customers back in FY '17. The longer deal duration in FY '17 has enabled us to increase our focus on driving adoption of emerging technologies, which, as I noted earlier, continues to grow at a rapid rate. The shorter deal duration will have an impact on both bookings and billings growth rates in FY '19.
Lastly, our geographical bookings mix was 50% from the Americas, 28% from EMEA and 22% from Asia Pacific. The percent in Americas was impacted by the smaller base of large customer renewals we just mentioned.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates. As I discussed at the beginning of my prepared remarks, many of the foreign exchange rates we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we gave guidance in March. As a result, for the full year, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.375 billion to $3.410 billion to reflect the $50 million impact from foreign exchange rates as of today. In constant currency growth, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of approximately 16% to 17% at the high end. As a result of the foreign currencies weakening since March, the resulting year-over-year growth in USD would be approximately 16% to 17%.  As for other changes to our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our annual effective tax rate was lower than expected and our planning -- and are now planning for a 22.5% tax rate.
Our full year non-GAAP EPS will increase to approximately $3.44 to $3.48 per share. This also assumes approximately $4  million per quarter for net other income and approximately 185 million diluted shares, which does not include any impact from the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced today. While we are reducing our effective tax rate to 22.5% for FY '19, we believe it will be prudent to continue to use a 25% tax rate in FY '20 and beyond as we continue to evaluate the impact from the U.S. tax reform. All other previous non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged, including our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% and operating cash flow outlook of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
For Q2, we offer the following outlook. After adjusting for the foreign exchange rate impact of approximately $15 million, we expect revenue to be in the range of $822 million to $830 million, which is up approximately 14% to 15% in both USD and constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 with 185 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable, depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping the quarter. We delivered financial results that were in line with our expectations. We remain confident and focused on partnering with our customers on their journey to adopting our technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing.
Elise, at this point, please open the call up for questions."

And so I do think the step change that you get when we talked about the big renewals, where we typically get a step-up, that happens in a renewal, not necessarily each year in a 3-year deal. And so haven't modeled it out, but my hypothesis would be there's some of that happening as well since we just have fewer those big renewals that are happening in this quarter."

It's really a pause as customers are really starting to look at whether they're going to containerize their environments or are they going to move to a more contemporary middleware solution. We're working with customers in terms of what does that technical road map look like. We had mentioned this in Analyst Day that we expect this to be several quarters because it is a pretty big technical decision that customers have to make. And they're certainly looking at that, and we expect that to happen over time. And then as we look at 606, there is no impact to EPS. And we've provided some supplemental information in our press release, which gives some detailed schedules. And really, the biggest change there certainly from a restatement standpoint is, as Tom had mentioned, we updated the fact that we're now able to amortize the fringe benefits associated with commissions.

As you think about modeling it out, what I've been saying is certainly, the first half is going to continue to be strong. We may see some of that strength continue into the third quarter, but then what our plan has been and as we're continuing to get the partner ecosystem really up and running around a lot of these emerging technologies, we're really starting to kind of scale a lot of that out to them.

What that's really a reflection of is we've seen a little bit more business in some of our international countries that have a little bit elongated longer payment terms, which has propped that up a few days. So that's really what's driving that. In terms of linearity, we continue to -- and this is something that as we talked about last year all throughout the year, we saw improvements as we went through last year. And then when we got into Q4, we certainly saw a lot more of our business happen in the last month of the quarter, which, as you can appreciate, when it happens in the last month of the quarter, in the last quarter of the year, that's going to certainly flow over from a cash flow perspective into this year, which is what we certainly saw. But as we look at our in-quarter linearity, it's fairly consistent with where it was. Actually, it's actually -- we're seeing a little bit more slide towards the back end of our quarter, our month 3 in this quarter. So we continue to focus in on it. There's been a lot of things that we've done in terms of managing linearity, but it's one of these things, too, where we're not going to do anything unnatural to close a deal within a particular month in a quarter. But certainly, as the renewals and the renewal rates, we're seeing high renewals happening on time. So depending upon when they're due up, we're pretty confident that we'll see some of those patterns repeat. But nonetheless, linearity is going to be a continued focus for us. But what I would just, as everyone is starting to really model it out, what's the most important linearity from our perspective obviously is what happens in Q4 and how much business happens in the last month of the quarter because that's really going to determine what gets collected in the next fiscal year.

But is there any sense that you're getting that there might be a reversal, so to speak, of the very strong on-premise spending that's been demonstrated for Red Hat and others over the last 5 quarters, say? Is your sense that there's any less spending on RHEL, the infrastructure piece as it relates to perhaps a broader trend on on-premise spending?"

So looking at RHEL overall I don't think helps you try to suss out public cloud versus on-premise, right, because, well, our CCSP, our Cloud Access, all that is in the RHEL number. And so I don't know if we -- if that kind of provides any clarity around public cloud versus on-premise. We continue to see really good traction and a lot of growth in the CCSP business and in the Cloud Access business. So we feel very, very comfortable that public cloud is actually a -- is a tailwind overall to RHEL. Bunch of moving parts around the RHEL number. Recognize OpenShift includes RHEL. It's a different way to do it. So when someone moves to OpenShift, that comes out of RHEL. OpenStack is typically sold in a bundle with RHEL, and so that's in the OpenStack number. So there are a lot of moving pieces around RHEL. So look 1 quarter, I wouldn't draw too much from it. But no matter what, you can't really look at that as somehow indicative of on-premise just given the strength we're seeing with RHEL in the public cloud."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal '19.

Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics, along with our earnings release, included in -- including in that is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. 
Please note, this quarter, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information provided in the supplemental information section of the press release. The adoption of 606 did not, as previously reported, materially impact our total revenues and had no impact on net cash. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 related to the deferral of incremental commissions and other costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Previously, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs and amortized those costs over the contract term. Under the new standard, we are also amortizing related fringe benefit costs over the contract term. These changes are reflected in the current and prior year's results for both GAAP and non-GAAP.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our second quarter and full fiscal year FY '19. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business, which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

As customers continue to view the move to hybrid cloud architectures as a top strategic priority, Red Hat is positioned as one of the foundational components of this strategy. We demonstrated this at the Red Hat Summit this year, where more than 100 customers from around the globe spoke about how they deployed our broad portfolio of technologies to successfully achieve their initiatives and transform their businesses.
Before I expand on some of the key events from the Red Hat Summit, let me provide you with some highlights in the quarter. We delivered total revenue growth of approximately 20% for the fourth straight quarter in USD. We delivered double-digit core infrastructure growth while also driving growth in Application Development and other emerging technologies above 30%. This resulted in annualized revenue run rate approaching $800 million and was particularly strong when considering the ongoing transition of middleware from stand-alone deployments to containerized cloud-based services.
Our overall growth is being driven by our ability to deliver next-generation platforms to help customers address some of their most pressing challenges that they face when creating, deploying and managing applications that run their businesses. Let me give you a few examples. First, we delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in deals over $1 million, due in part to the fact that 70% of these deals, including one or more components of our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Second, we drove strong growth in our Linux container platform, OpenShift, where we added over 100 new customers in the quarter and continue to grow median revenue per customer. Third, we continued to experience high demand for our services business, which grew 27%. This result was driven by additional consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift. A fourth example, we eclipsed 1,000 customers for our Ansible subscribers in Q1, up approximately 70% year-over-year. We believe this type of momentum around our end-to-end suite of next-generation technologies and related services will enable us to deliver choice and innovation for our customers as they develop, deploy and manage their applications.
Now let's turn to discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights. Our marquee user event, the Red Hat Summit, was held in San Francisco in May. We had record attendance with approximately 7,500 attendees, including developers, IT decision-makers and partners. This was a 20% increase from last year's event. In addition to the high level of customer participation and several technology announcements, we also had some key partner announcements with OpenShift, our container platform. As published in their October 2017 Smarter with Gartner blog, 6 best practices for creating a container platform strategy, Gartner predicts that by 2020 more than 50% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 20% today.
Clearly, containers are becoming a major driver for Application Development. This is further evident in our announcements, which I'll describe, between Red Hat and 2 of the major public cloud providers. These are in addition to last year's announcement at Summit in Boston, where we extended our strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services to further integrate OpenShift, enabling Amazon Web Services within -- AWS services within OpenShift Container Platform for hybrid users.
This year, first, we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to empower enterprise developers to run container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on-premise environments. With this collaboration, we will introduce the first jointly managed OpenShift offering in the public cloud, combining the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform and Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. OpenShift on Azure will be configured and designed to reduce the complexity of container management for customers. As the company's preferred offering for hybrid container workflows for our joint customers, Red Hat and Microsoft will manage this solution for customers with support from both companies.
In addition to being a fully managed service, Red Hat OpenShift on Azure is expected to bring enterprise developers the flexibility to freely move applications between both on-premise environments and Azure using OpenShift, which offers a consistent container platform across the hybrid cloud. It will also bring increased productivity by providing a development platform that integrates natively with Azure infrastructure. We're excited about this new offering, which will be available in preview in the coming months.
The second key partner announcement from Summit for OpenShift was with IBM, where we extended our long-standing collaboration to bring together OpenShift and IBM Cloud Private with a number of IBM software and cloud solutions. This agreement builds on the recent move by IBM to modernize its software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, MQ Series and DB2. Container technologies are increasingly being used as a reliable way to move applications across multiple IT footprints from existing data centers or private clouds to public cloud and vice versa. This collaboration between IBM and Red Hat provides an additional pathway for enterprises to adopt hybrid cloud computing.
Through this new agreement, IBM and Red Hat customers can now maximize their existing technology investments and move them more easily to the hybrid cloud with IBM Cloud Private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation. They can build and deploy Red Hat-certified container applications on one single integrated container platform, IBM Cloud Private, which provides a single view of all enterprise data, and enable developers to design, modernize and deploy new applications more quickly while taking advantage of IBM's cloud-based services such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain with IBM Cloud Private on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As part of this agreement, IBM will extend its private cloud platforms and middleware offerings to OpenShift as Red Hat-certified containers. This exemplifies the broader transition we are seeing in middleware to deployments as a service on top of containers. Our dual strength in containers and middleware positions us well to compete in the middleware addressable market that is estimated to reach $18 billion by 2021.
We have recently announced a series of product updates and enhancements to integrate our offerings more closely with OpenShift. This allows us to offer our middleware as containerized cloud-based services. We have created a new team focused on this area, and we will update you on our progress to drive additional growth in middleware over the next few quarters.
In summary, as was on display at Red Hat Summit, customers are deploying hybrid cloud technologies to enable them to compete in this world of digital transformation. We believe Red Hat has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions and partners to be one of the leaders in digital innovation. We've worked hard to build a reputation as a trusted brand and modern IT technology and believe we are well positioned to drive growth as we look ahead.
Before turning this call over, I want to thank all of our global associates, from the team that runs great events like the Red Hat Summit and to every one of Red Hat's 12,000 associates that are focused on our customers every day. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also thank our global associates for their continued commitment to our customers, partners and the open source communities.
As Jim discussed, our financial performance continues to be driven by the strong demand for our hybrid cloud technologies. Highlighting the Q1 financial results, we delivered a combination of the following: year-over-year revenue growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 19% and operating cash flow growth of 34%.
Before I discuss our results in further detail, please note that many of the foreign currencies that we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we provided guidance back in March. For instance, total revenue for the quarter would have been $3 million higher using the FX rates from March. As for the impact to our full year revenue outlook, we are reaffirming the growth on a constant currency basis of 16% to 17%, while we adjust the dollar range down by $50 million for the changes in FX rates as of today, which I will discuss in more detail at the end of the call. Given this FX volatility in the quarter, I will provide results in both USD and constant currency growth, and you will find a more detailed table of our constant currency results and reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP in our earnings press release.
Now I will begin with a review of our Q1 performance and business metrics, and then I will move to our outlook for Q2 and FY '19. We delivered $814 million of total revenue for the first quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance and represented growth of 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. Adjusting for the $3 million FX headwind I noted earlier, we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $7 million. The upside was driven primarily by a higher demand for services supporting our emerging technologies.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, constituted 87% of total revenue in Q1 and grew 19% in USD or 16% in constant currency. Double-digit growth across our subscription portfolio drove this result. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $522 million, an increase of 14% in USD year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and emerging technology offerings was $189 million, a year-over-year increase of 37% in USD or 32% in constant currency. Within this portfolio of solutions, our emerging technologies, which include Ansible, OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and cloud management offerings continue to make strong traction. As we discussed last quarter, the emerging technology performance is somewhat offset by a moderated growth rate for our middleware offerings, as some customers begin to consider shifting their workloads from traditional physical deployments to container environments. We believe this transition will impact the revenue growth of the middleware business this year and as such, had previously factored this into our full year guidance provided back in March. We believe that, in the long run, as customers shift more applications to container environments, it will benefit our middleware results and Red Hat overall.
Overall Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 23% of total revenue, up 270 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Lastly, our services revenue of $102 million grew 27% year-over-year in USD or 24% in constant currency. This impressive growth of our services business has been fueled by the demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift offerings.
Before I move to the income statement, as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $168 million grew 19% in USD year-over-year and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%. This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than our guidance. As for net other income, it was $4 million for the quarter, in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete tax benefits, was 22.8% for the quarter and lower than our original guidance of 25% due to the U.S. tax reform. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.72, up 24% year-over-year in USD and above our guidance of $0.68 with the lower tax rate contributing $0.02 to the $0.04 beat.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.5 billion. After factoring in the additional cash from incremental repatriation in Q1, our U.S. versus non-U.S. cash balance is a 55%-45% split. Our total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $390 million, up 19% in USD or 18% in constant currency for the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to operating cash flow. We delivered $346 million for the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q1 cash flow performance was the result of strong collections on our Q4 billings, which, as we discussed last quarter, was more heavily weighted to February, shifting the collections to this quarter. Our FX-adjusted DSO was 66 days, up 62 -- up from 62 in the prior year quarter.
The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $858 million, up 20% in USD or 17% in constant currency. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Next, let me discuss our total backlog, which we will now be disclosing on a quarterly basis in our Form 10-Q filing pursuant to the changes of adopting ASC 606. Estimated total backlog was up 21% year-over-year in USD from the prior year quarter for a balance of $3.3 billion in USD.
I will now review some highlights related to our bookings performance. Looking at our top deals, 25 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value. This continues to demonstrate the strong partnership our customers have with Red Hat as they modernize their IT environments.
In addition to our top deals, cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including one or more components from our group of Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. Our top industry vertical within the deals greater than $1 million was our other mainstream vertical, which includes sectors such as health care, hospitality and transportation. Our second largest industry vertical was the government. As Jim noted, the growth of deals over $1 million was strong in the quarter with a total of 65 deals, up approximately 48% year-over-year. Within these deals, 6 were greater than $5 million and one deal was greater than $10 million, which was 3 less than Q1 last year.
As we discussed at Analyst Day, we are focused on building our strategic partnerships within our mid-market customers. In Q1, our mid-market deals greater than $250,000 increased 138% year-over-year from 21 deals to 50 deals with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. Our partnership with global systems integrators is helping to drive growth in the mid-market with these emerging technologies. As for the route to market, 75% was from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force compared to the prior Q1 split of 72% and 28%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was just over 21 months, 0.5 month shorter than Q1 last year. Consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day, we continue to believe duration will be approximately 1 month shorter for the full fiscal year. The shorter duration is driven in part by an increased focus on our mid-market customers, which typically start out with a shorter subscription duration. As we also highlighted in Analyst Day, there is a smaller base of large customer renewal this year as we increase our strategic partnerships with many of our largest customers back in FY '17. The longer deal duration in FY '17 has enabled us to increase our focus on driving adoption of emerging technologies, which, as I noted earlier, continues to grow at a rapid rate. The shorter deal duration will have an impact on both bookings and billings growth rates in FY '19.
Lastly, our geographical bookings mix was 50% from the Americas, 28% from EMEA and 22% from Asia Pacific. The percent in Americas was impacted by the smaller base of large customer renewals we just mentioned.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates. As I discussed at the beginning of my prepared remarks, many of the foreign exchange rates we conduct business in have weakened against the dollar since we gave guidance in March. As a result, for the full year, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.375 billion to $3.410 billion to reflect the $50 million impact from foreign exchange rates as of today. In constant currency growth, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of approximately 16% to 17% at the high end. As a result of the foreign currencies weakening since March, the resulting year-over-year growth in USD would be approximately 16% to 17%. As for other changes to our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our annual effective tax rate was lower than expected and our planning -- and are now planning for a 22.5% tax rate.
Our full year non-GAAP EPS will increase to approximately $3.44 to $3.48 per share. This also assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 185 million diluted shares, which does not include any impact from the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced today. While we are reducing our effective tax rate to 22.5% for FY '19, we believe it will be prudent to continue to use a 25% tax rate in FY '20 and beyond as we continue to evaluate the impact from the U.S. tax reform. All other previous non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged, including our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% and operating cash flow outlook of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion.
For Q2, we offer the following outlook. After adjusting for the foreign exchange rate impact of approximately $15 million, we expect revenue to be in the range of $822 million to $830 million, which is up approximately 14% to 15% in both USD and constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 with 185 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable, depending upon individual payments or collections.
Recapping the quarter. We delivered financial results that were in line with our expectations. We remain confident and focused on partnering with our customers on their journey to adopting our technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing.
Elise, at this point, please open the call up for questions."

So there's a little bit of an impact associated with middleware in there as well, which, as OpenShift grows, we think that turns back around."

We're working with customers in terms of what does that technical road map look like. We had mentioned this in Analyst Day that we expect this to be several quarters because it is a pretty big technical decision that customers have to make. And they're certainly looking at that, and we expect that to happen over time. And then as we look at 606, there is no impact to EPS. And we've provided some supplemental information in our press release, which gives some detailed schedules.

What that's really a reflection of is we've seen a little bit more business in some of our international countries that have a little bit elongated longer payment terms, which has propped that up a few days. So that's really what's driving that. In terms of linearity, we continue to -- and this is something that as we talked about last year all throughout the year, we saw improvements as we went through last year. And then when we got into Q4, we certainly saw a lot more of our business happen in the last month of the quarter, which, as you can appreciate, when it happens in the last month of the quarter, in the last quarter of the year, that's going to certainly flow over from a cash flow perspective into this year, which is what we certainly saw. But as we look at our in-quarter linearity, it's fairly consistent with where it was. Actually, it's actually -- we're seeing a little bit more slide towards the back end of our quarter, our month 3 in this quarter. So we continue to focus in on it. There's been a lot of things that we've done in terms of managing linearity, but it's one of these things, too, where we're not going to do anything unnatural to close a deal within a particular month in a quarter. But certainly, as the renewals and the renewal rates, we're seeing high renewals happening on time. So depending upon when they're due up, we're pretty confident that we'll see some of those patterns repeat. But nonetheless, linearity is going to be a continued focus for us. But what I would just, as everyone is starting to really model it out, what's the most important linearity from our perspective obviously is what happens in Q4 and how much business happens in the last month of the quarter because that's really going to determine what gets collected in the next fiscal year. And that's really what we're focused in on."

That obviously kind of drains a set of renewals out of this year. And so it's down some, right? And so that does have a bit of an impact and on linearity because net new happens later as well as typically on pipeline, renewals, we have a high renewal rate on. We need a higher pipeline vis-à-vis net new because, obviously, some things don't happen. So that's -- there is a bit of a headwind there, but we're -- I feel confident we're working through it because we have good traction with the new offerings."

And a lot of these renewals, they do happen at the customer's request, right? Because as we're working with customers and as they're starting to look at different options around their technology and updating their infrastructure, a lot of our customers are coming to us increasing the number of different components of our technology within there. So a lot of times, we'll end up re-renewing, and we're certainly going to do that where it makes sense for the customer. So just of our 50 largest renewals that would have happened this year, they've already happened in a prior year in an aggregate amount. So from a company standpoint and from a customer standpoint, this is absolutely what we want to do, but certainly, as Jim had mentioned, it certainly means that we need to go get more net new business this year which is what we're focused on and working on."

If I focus on the results that you had tonight and the guidance, it seems like the infrastructure piece or RHEL is a little bit less than what we've been thinking about. And I know you said there might be some timing issues. But is there any sense that you're getting that there might be a reversal, so to speak, of the very strong on-premise spending that's been demonstrated for Red Hat and others over the last 5 quarters, say? Is your sense that there's any less spending on RHEL, the infrastructure piece as it relates to perhaps a broader trend on on-premise spending?"

And so I don't know if we -- if that kind of provides any clarity around public cloud versus on-premise. We continue to see really good traction and a lot of growth in the CCSP business and in the Cloud Access business. So we feel very, very comfortable that public cloud is actually a -- is a tailwind overall to RHEL. Bunch of moving parts around the RHEL number. Recognize OpenShift includes RHEL. It's a different way to do it. So when someone moves to OpenShift, that comes out of RHEL. OpenStack is typically sold in a bundle with RHEL, and so that's in the OpenStack number. So there are a lot of moving pieces around RHEL. So look 1 quarter, I wouldn't draw too much from it. But no matter what, you can't really look at that as somehow indicative of on-premise just given the strength we're seeing with RHEL in the public cloud."

We enable",677,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. In the second quarter, we continued to see demand from our customers around the globe as they focus on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives. We enable our customers to succeed on these initiatives with our innovative solutions, award-winning support and global services. Our focus on customers helped us drive strong results in the second quarter where we delivered double digit growth in a number of our key financial metrics. Let me highlight a few of those for the quarter. 
Our total backlog, driven by strong bookings, grew 20% year-over-year. Our major geographic regions each grew bookings at double digit rates year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenues grew more than 30% year-over-year. And our services revenue, led by demand for OpenShift and Ansible consulting and training, grew 19% year-over-year in constant currency. 
Now let me give you some business metrics and highlights that demonstrate our continued traction with our customers and partners. Looking at our deals over $1 million this quarter, we closed a total of 73 deals over $1 million, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Within these deals, 11 were greater than $5 million, which is a record in a Q2 for us, and 1 deal was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was strong in this cohort, over 76% of the top deals greater than $1 million including one or more components of our Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. One of the deals over $5 million was the largest services deal we have every closed in a quarter. This deal is with a global bank that is digitally transforming their payments business based on our integration middleware. Other top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were financials services and the government sector. 
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal did so at an aggregate value of more than 100% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is a rare competitive loss to a legacy on-premise provider based on pricing. We're actively pursuing future business with this customer as they evaluate additional technologies, such as adopting OpenShift as a multi-cloud platform for the digital transformation of their business. Removing the one lost deal and using the next largest deal that did renew, the adjusted top 25 deals for the quarter would have renewed at an aggregate value of approximately 115% of their previous value. 
Looking more broadly across our customer base at 2 of our fastest-growing technologies, OpenShift and Ansible, let me provide you with some recent achievements to demonstrate the momentum we're seeing with our customers and partners. Last week, we announced a multi-partner relationship with HortonWorks and IBM Cloud Private to bring their big data and analytics products onto OpenShift. This is designed to enable customers to develop and run data-intensive applications on OpenShift, bringing them the power of hybrid cloud. Our Ansible technology reached approximately 2 million managed ned at the end of Q2, essentially doubling the number of managed nodes since Q4 of last year. Overall, both of these technologies added nearly 100 new customers each since Q1, and to continue to grow the median revenue per customer. 
In summary, we continue to drive significant adoption of our hybrid cloud technologies, even as we worked with the headwinds in middleware and our renewal base that we view and have previously disclosed -- discussed. We are being confident in our long-term competitive position and our proven ability to become increasingly strategic with our customers, as evidenced by our growth over the past several quarters with large customer engagements and momentum with our partners. I want to thank Red Hat associates for their tireless efforts in serving our customers. From building innovative solutions to delivering and supporting these technologies, we continue to stay focused on the success of our customers and delivering value every day. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed. Red Hat's ability to deliver business value has been a key driver to building a multibillion-dollar business, and the strength of our strategic customer relationships is one of the reasons we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Our performance this quarter was driven by the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies, which enabled us to deliver results that were in line with our guidance. 
As a result of our performance to date and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth in constant currency at 16% to 17%, along with our full year non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow. However, in U.S. dollars, we are lowering the full year revenue range by approximately $15 million to account solely for the change in FX rates, as the trend of weaker rates against the dollar for many of the major foreign currencies has continued to decline in recent months. For instance, Q2 total revenue would have been nearly $3 million higher using the FX rates from my June guidance. As such for this call, I will discuss our results in both USD and constant currency to provide a full view of the impact of foreign currency on our results. A more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our -- for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP is included in our press release. 
I will now review our Q2 performance and business metrics before finishing with our outlook for Q3 and the rest of FY '19. In the second quarter, we delivered $823 million of total revenue, which was in line with guidance and represented growth of 14% in both USD and constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, this result of USD included a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $3 million from the rates used for guidance in June. 
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, made up 88% of total revenue in Q2 and grew 13% in USD or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $527 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. This result was impacted by the lower available renewal base, which is largely RHEL, and the lower renewal value that Jim discussed in our top 25 renewals metric. Year-to-date, our infrastructure-related offerings are up 11% in USD and 10% in constant currency. 
Subscription revenue for our Application Development and other emerging technology offerings was $196 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. Within this portfolio, we continue to drive rapid growth in our emerging technologies, particularly in Ansible and OpenShift. As we discussed in the past, this growth has become somewhat offset by the moderation we are experiencing in our middleware offerings. We continue to believe that as customers shift their workloads to container environments, our middleware results and subscription revenue will benefit in the long run.  Overall, Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 24% of total revenue, of 300 basis points from the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, our services revenue of $100 million grew 17% year-over-year in USD or 19% in constant currency. The strong growth of our services business was driven by demand for training and consulting projects for our Ansible and OpenShift offerings. As I have mentioned before, our services business is both a leading and lagging indicator for the demand around our emerging products. We have seen that customers who buy both services and subscriptions tend to have a higher retention, which can lead to future opportunities and additional technology sales. 
Before we move to our non-GAAP operating income results, as a reminder, our non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and transaction costs related to business combinations. Non-GAAP EPS adjusts for all these items as well as noncash interest expense related to the debt discount. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 operating income of $197 million grew 3% year-over-year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. This quarterly result was 90 basis points higher than my June guidance and reflects some repositioning of hiring and marketing programs to the second half of the fiscal year. Net other income was $4 million and in line with guidance. 
Shifting to taxes and EPS, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter, which includes discrete tax benefits and the impact from certain nondeductible share based compensation expense. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, up 10% year-over-year and above my guidance as a result of the higher non-GAAP operating margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $341 million, representing growth of 17% in USD or 19% in constant currency over the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $250 million or 1.7 million shares under our new share repurchase authorization, which has a remaining balance of approximately $750 million. In addition, we had approximately $245 million of total cash and outflows related to repayment of convertible notes. 
Moving to operational cash flow, with the adoption of the accounting standard ASU 2016-'15: Statement of Cash Flows, which requires us to classify the portion of the repayment of convertible notes attributable to debt discount as an operating cash flow as opposed to financing cash outflow. In an effort to appropriately reflect the cash generated from the operations of the business and for comparability of prior periods, we will provide both a GAAP and non-GAAP operating cash flow metric. 
Our GAAP operating cash flow, inclusive of the $32 million of repayments for the convertible notes attributable to the debt discount, was $133 million, down 7% year-over-year. The non-GAAP operating cash flow was $165 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. 
Our FX-adjusted DSO was 61 days, up 5 days from Q2 of last year, driven by business linearity. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $884 million, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus change in deferred revenue on the cash flows statement for the last 4 quarters. 
Now I will discuss our total backlog for Q2, which includes billed contracts from the balance sheet, the new ASC 606 performance obligation disclosures, and our backlog for time and materials service bookings. Total backlog was up 20% year-over-year in Q2 for an estimated balance of $3.3 billion in USD. Our backlog in the quarter was a result of our bookings performance, with all of our regions at double-digit growth year-over-year. As for the regional mix in the second quarter, 54% of our bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. The second quarter route to market mix was 77% from the channel and 23% from our direct sales force compared to second quarter prior year's split of 79% and 21%. 
Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 22 months, up nearly 1 month from Q2 last year. We attribute this to some customers choosing to extend their commitment to Red Hat with a longer-term strategic partnership. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally continued to weaken against the dollar year-over-year. 
I will begin with our full year guidance, which assumes an incremental FX headwind to revenue of $15 million as compared to our prior guidance. As a result, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.360 billion to $3.395 billion or a year-over-year growth range of 15% to 16% in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of 16% to 17%.
From a profitability perspective, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, which includes the necessary investments to drive future growth. 
We are planning an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for FY '19 prior to discrete items, and our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.45 to $3.49 per share. This assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 184 million diluted shares, which is lower due to share repurchases. 
Due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of any future convertible note settlements, our guidance will now be on the non-GAAP operating cash flow for FY '19. Excluding the repayments of convertible notes that are attributable to the debt discount, our outlook remains unchanged for the full year. Non-GAAP operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion, which includes an incremental $10 million in tax payments. 
For Q3, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $848 million to $856 million, which is up approximately 13% to 14% in USD and 15% to 16% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 with a 22.5% tax rate prior to discrete items. This assumes approximately $4 million in Q3 for net other income and 184 million diluted shares. 
We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections. 
Looking forward, we remain excited that Red Hat is increasingly viewed as a top strategic IT partner to the world's leading companies as they execute on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives and we remain committed to our customers success. David, at this point, please open up the call for questions."

So yes, we haven't actually looked at it quite like a number that way. only reason I say that because the cloud revenue is immediate revenue. And obviously, our normal subscription business is lumpier when we do either 1- or 3-year deals. I think a lot of our new smaller customers are coming in via cloud. We have some really nice growth there, it's still growing at more than twice the growth rate of the company. So yes, a lot of that we believe this new business. The core business, customers are continuing to renew, we give you those numbers. The odd part, just to remind everyone, we started about 2.5 years ago focusing on trying to do multiyear deals to try to basically get our customers kind of into multiyear engagement, so our sales force could focus on net new. Well obviously 3 years, 2.5 years into that, yes, we've done our best of get people in 3-year deals. So our renewal base is quite small relative to where it's been in the past. And it's at renewal where we typically takeup the size of those relationships. So yes, fewer renewals means less takeup in these last couple of quarters. With again, I mean we're seeing it from both. We still see a lot of growth with our existing customers. And as we talked about in the past, customers who are adopting cloud tend to grow their RHEL footprint faster than those who aren't."

However, having said that, as you can imagine, as we look at some of the other trends in the business, we did a slight pullback in certain areas. Certainly not in our sales area, because that's key area of investment and continued investment. So there was a little bit of cost management as we went through the quarter. Essentially as you think about the guide for the rest of the year, I expect the margin essentially to be flat as we go into Q3. And then it will pop up into Q4 because some of the marketing spend that we have will be actually done in Q3 versus Q4. So we're going to continue to actively manage the costs side. But at the same time too, I just want to emphasize that we are continuing to be very, very mindful about making the appropriate investments into our more strategic areas. So a lot of those investments come, as we get efficiencies and productivity, in other spaces within the company.

I mean a little bit on PaaS, I mean, I would say obviously the vast majority of our revenue is backed when we come into a quarter. So coming into Q1 where we were light than we wanted to be on billings and backlog, kind of rolled through this -- obviously we had a lot stronger quarter this quarter in growth there. And so we had some better visibility looking forward into RHEL. And so we do think this is kind of the bottom there. Related to PaaS, we're seeing great traction. I mean we had over 100 new customers for OpenShift. Not only is it customers, it's also partners. And so unlike some other software companies that will pay tens of millions of dollars to enable SIs, we focus on bottom-up demand generation. And so we've gotten really good bottom-up support for OpenShift. And now the large global system integrators are all building practices around OpenShift, and I think that also leads to an incremental traction. I think the Microsoft deal which we announced, the relationship that we announced back in Summit, is -- has raised awareness that it has helped as well. So I was in Europe last week. And I think out of that maybe 30 or so customer meetings I had, 20-something of them were about OpenShift in particular. It really is a topic that people want to understand and figure out how to do in containers. I would say, just editorial comment, I also think one of the things that has slowed RHEL growth a bit is customers want to talk about containers. And we need to continue to talk about RHEL is part of that portfolio. And I think the shiny object syndrome gets us all, the EMEA included, where we're talking about OpenShift and Ansible because there is so much traction around them. But overall, I -- it's hard to find a customer that's not looking at or starting to use OpenShift in some way, which is great to see."

As we get into next year, we have a much larger renewal base. And since OpenShift's continuing its momentum, which I hope it does, I would say it can easily accelerate quite a bit. But we are running into a little bit of a sales capacity issue. And so the better OpenShift does and the more time we're spending on that, the less time we're selling RHEL. So the demand is clearly there, the market is clearly there. And so I mean given the size of the renewal base, I think it will expand a little bit more than that, but I want to be a little bit guarded just as people are -- there's just so much momentum around OpenShift right now, that it does kind of eat into selling time on RHEL. So clearly, the -- if you look at the overall trends from move of workloads to Windows to Linux and the overall growth of workloads certainly feel like it should reaccelerate above 10 and back into the teens. But again, our other products can at times start to push that out a little bit, which is part of the dynamic that we've seen with the strength that OpenShift affecting RHEL a bit.

That's the differentiation that telcos have. So we have a significant amount of engineering effort working with the telcos on OpenShift as well. timing of that, again those deals continue to grow.

Now I say that, and as I mentioned previously, one of the things that makes the renewals analysis challenging for all of us is that assumes that customers don't come to us and decide that they want to co-term something early. So certainly if we have a customer that comes in the second half of this year where they have something that's going to renew next year, but if they come to us and say, ""Gee, we like to do a bigger engagement and we'd like to infuse some OpenShift or OpenStack,"" et cetera, we absolutely would do that deal. And that would throw some of this off, and there is a fair amount of that as that happens. Certainly the one thing we're not going to do is pull in deals ourselves. But if a customer has a business need and they want to expand their scope with us, we absolutely will entertain them. So barring any big go terms happening in the second half of this year, I would say in your models, I would assume the latter part of Q1, and then really as you get into Q2 onwards is when we see it pick back up."

But some of the time on that deal is spent on the renewal of the components around it, where the reason we originally started 2.5 years ago trying to get people these 3-year deals is it frees up more time to sell net new. that may be efficient to sell and it may be shorter like 1-year deals, but it does -- it kind of creates more of kind of clarity and focus in our go-to-market organization. So hard to say which of those actually kind of weighs out in terms of the emerging. I would say on balance that the team, they're going to say attach and growing cross-sell, upsell around the renewal is the more efficient way to see that growth. But again, it is more sales time spent on that renewal as well than on the new business. So yes, there might be a little bit of an impact there accelerating the other associated with it. But the big impact is those renewals typically grow, and we give you the data on that. So bigger renewal base does a lot to especially help RHEL growth."

So beyond the existing renewal base that we have, part of what we're doing very intentionality is going to that next tier of customers to be able to get certainly and grow an additional set of enterprise customers as we go forward. So some of this is going to be layering it on. But I think as Jim said, I mean I think there is nice cross-selling opportunities across the board with the existing renewal base that we have."

And the one that we lost, we did an even bigger middleware deal with after. When we lost people in the past, we have typically won them back. It sounds logical to say, ""Oh, I can get a cheaper price for my Linux.""  But what production customers find is they don't get that quality of software and certainly not support that they get from us. And so honestly, I don't mind losing one every now and then. If we win them all, then we're probably overpricing. And we have a really good track record of winning them back as they've had a chance to experience the other. And so given that that and how rare the losses are and how often the losses have come back, and even they come reference customers for us. We also always want to take competitors seriously. But in terms of over looking at this one deal, I wouldn't kind of overly focus on that relative to our long-term history of competing with others. In terms of middleware, you hit on a good point. the same way that we did multiyear deals on RHEL, lots of those deals on stand-alone JBoss deals were multiyear deals 3 years ago as well. So there was a lot of renewal on JBoss coming up for next year as well. And so again, that's -- that will be a good opportunity for us to continue to expand those."

But -- and this is asked in a [indiscernible]  manner, it's really usually not a good sign when a growth business starts to talk about the effects of the renewal cycle, the reasons of moderating growth.

I don't know what it could be. like there's people have fear at times that people are going to start in the public cloud, start to use sort of the free versions or not unpaid Linux. is there a saturation on-premise?

I was beginning to think somebody was impersonating you. So I appreciate that. But no, seriously on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is because we've always talked about how we get into a customer. And our business grows with them, and that almost always that growth happens when we step up that renewal time. And for a long time, we were more focused on doing 1-year deals than doing multiyear deals. And so every year, each of those deals would ratchet up. Well, and I still think it's the right decision. 2.5 years ago, we decided to focus more on doing multiyear deals, so we could get the customers locked into a set of technologies on which we could then go work to upsell, which we do. But the problem with that is that's been doing that for 2.5 years, you've drained a lot of the swamp of potential renewal, which means a deal we did making it up last year that had 20% growth. well that growth roll into revenue this year is 0. And the deal we did 2 years ago that had 20-something percent growth in it is rolling through revenue flat this year. And we just don't have as many renewals, because these are the people that we couldn't get in 3-year deals in the last 2 years, that are up now. And so yes, we see good growth. And we talked about since that one competitive loss, we still see solid upsell and cross-sell in our renewals when they come up. But the renewal is typically the precipitating event to do with the upsell and cross-sell as well. Certainly, that's not always the case. We have people in multiyear deals. We have multiple other deals with them. But that renewal is that participating event. Then we just -- it's a lot lower, which if you actually ask our sales team, the amount of net new growth that they have to get this year, they're seeing growth numbers 30%, 40%, 50% depending on the region, which given I don't want to say renewals are automatic. Obviously we don't have a very high renewal rate. That amount of new business that they're seeing is like dramatically higher in terms of the new business that they have to go get and are going and getting, than you're seeing in our revenue or even our bookings numbers, because of just kind of the relatively lower renewal rate. So that's why you hear us talking about it. It's not that we're ""milking"" the renewal. It's just we don't have the precipitating events as often as we typically do. And again, that starts to come back next year, because we get into the steady state of -- from  3 years ago, those renewals coming back around.  I don't think there's a change in focus on what we're doing. it's just the sheer math of how much business we have that we can cross-sell and upsell on."

And if you think about the customer engagement that we have, even looking at the CCSP program, our online program, we're harvesting those opportunities for future growth opportunities. So it starts with an our customers already using RHEL from a technology perspective, it's a whole lot easier of a conversation since they're already using our OS, to then start using OpenShift, especially as they're going to start containerizing their applications. So it really is more of a technology discussion and why it makes sense. So it's not just the fact that we're going back to the same customers, but it really is, as Jim said, a business event that makes it much easier for them to leverage newer technology."

We enable our customers to succeed on these initiatives with our innovative solutions, award-winning support and global services. Our focus on customers helped us drive strong results in the second quarter where we delivered double digit growth in a number of our key financial metrics. Let me highlight a few of those for the quarter. 
Our total backlog, driven by strong bookings, grew 20% year-over-year. Our major geographic regions each grew bookings at double digit rates year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenues grew more than 30% year-over-year. And our services revenue, led by demand for OpenShift and Ansible consulting and training, grew 19% year-over-year in constant currency. 
Now let me give you some business metrics and highlights that demonstrate our continued traction with our customers and partners. Looking at our deals over $1 million this quarter, we closed a total of 73 deals over $1 million, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Within these deals, 11 were greater than $5 million, which is a record in a Q2 for us, and 1 deal was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was strong in this cohort, over 76% of the top deals greater than $1 million including one or more components of our Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. One of the deals over $5 million was the largest services deal we have every closed in a quarter. This deal is with a global bank that is digitally transforming their payments business based on our integration middleware. Other top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were financials services and the government sector. 
Looking at our top deals, 24 out of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal did so at an aggregate value of more than 100% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is a rare competitive loss to a legacy on-premise provider based on pricing. We're actively pursuing future business with this customer as they evaluate additional technologies, such as adopting OpenShift as a multi-cloud platform for the digital transformation of their business. Removing the one lost deal and using the next largest deal that did renew, the adjusted top 25 deals for the quarter would have renewed at an aggregate value of approximately 115% of their previous value. 
Looking more broadly across our customer base at 2 of our fastest-growing technologies, OpenShift and Ansible, let me provide you with some recent achievements to demonstrate the momentum we're seeing with our customers and partners. Last week, we announced a multi-partner relationship with HortonWorks and IBM Cloud Private to bring their big data and analytics products onto OpenShift. This is designed to enable customers to develop and run data-intensive applications on OpenShift, bringing them the power of hybrid cloud. Our Ansible technology reached approximately 2 million managed ned at the end of Q2, essentially doubling the number of managed nodes since Q4 of last year. Overall, both of these technologies added nearly 100 new customers each since Q1, and to continue to grow the median revenue per customer. 
In summary, we continue to drive significant adoption of our hybrid cloud technologies, even as we worked with the headwinds in middleware and our renewal base that we view and have previously disclosed -- discussed. We are being confident in our long-term competitive position and our proven ability to become increasingly strategic with our customers, as evidenced by our growth over the past several quarters with large customer engagements and momentum with our partners. I want to thank Red Hat associates for their tireless efforts in serving our customers. From building innovative solutions to delivering and supporting these technologies, we continue to stay focused on the success of our customers and delivering value every day. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."
33679,579304651,1558495,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 19, 2018",2018-09-19,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed.

Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed. Red Hat's ability to deliver business value has been a key driver to building a multibillion-dollar business, and the strength of our strategic customer relationships is one of the reasons we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Our performance this quarter was driven by the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies, which enabled us to deliver results that were in line with our guidance. 
As a result of our performance to date and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth in constant currency at 16% to 17%, along with our full year non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow. However, in U.S. dollars, we are lowering the full year revenue range by approximately $15 million to account solely for the change in FX rates, as the trend of weaker rates against the dollar for many of the major foreign currencies has continued to decline in recent months. For instance, Q2 total revenue would have been nearly $3 million higher using the FX rates from my June guidance. As such for this call, I will discuss our results in both USD and constant currency to provide a full view of the impact of foreign currency on our results. A more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our -- for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP is included in our press release. 
I will now review our Q2 performance and business metrics before finishing with our outlook for Q3 and the rest of FY '19. In the second quarter, we delivered $823 million of total revenue, which was in line with guidance and represented growth of 14% in both USD and constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, this result of USD included a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $3 million from the rates used for guidance in June. 
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, made up 88% of total revenue in Q2 and grew 13% in USD or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $527 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. This result was impacted by the lower available renewal base, which is largely RHEL, and the lower renewal value that Jim discussed in our top 25 renewals metric. Year-to-date, our infrastructure-related offerings are up 11% in USD and 10% in constant currency. 
Subscription revenue for our Application Development and other emerging technology offerings was $196 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. Within this portfolio, we continue to drive rapid growth in our emerging technologies, particularly in Ansible and OpenShift. As we discussed in the past, this growth has become somewhat offset by the moderation we are experiencing in our middleware offerings. We continue to believe that as customers shift their workloads to container environments, our middleware results and subscription revenue will benefit in the long run.  Overall, Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 24% of total revenue, of 300 basis points from the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, our services revenue of $100 million grew 17% year-over-year in USD or 19% in constant currency. The strong growth of our services business was driven by demand for training and consulting projects for our Ansible and OpenShift offerings. As I have mentioned before, our services business is both a leading and lagging indicator for the demand around our emerging products. We have seen that customers who buy both services and subscriptions tend to have a higher retention, which can lead to future opportunities and additional technology sales. 
Before we move to our non-GAAP operating income results, as a reminder, our non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and transaction costs related to business combinations. Non-GAAP EPS adjusts for all these items as well as noncash interest expense related to the debt discount. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 operating income of $197 million grew 3% year-over-year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. This quarterly result was 90 basis points higher than my June guidance and reflects some repositioning of hiring and marketing programs to the second half of the fiscal year. Net other income was $4 million and in line with guidance. 
Shifting to taxes and EPS, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter, which includes discrete tax benefits and the impact from certain nondeductible share based compensation expense. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, up 10% year-over-year and above my guidance as a result of the higher non-GAAP operating margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $341 million, representing growth of 17% in USD or 19% in constant currency over the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $250 million or 1.7 million shares under our new share repurchase authorization, which has a remaining balance of approximately $750 million. In addition, we had approximately $245 million of total cash and outflows related to repayment of convertible notes. 
Moving to operational cash flow, with the adoption of the accounting standard ASU 2016-'15: Statement of Cash Flows, which requires us to classify the portion of the repayment of convertible notes attributable to debt discount as an operating cash flow as opposed to financing cash outflow. In an effort to appropriately reflect the cash generated from the operations of the business and for comparability of prior periods, we will provide both a GAAP and non-GAAP operating cash flow metric. 
Our GAAP operating cash flow, inclusive of the $32 million of repayments for the convertible notes attributable to the debt discount, was $133 million, down 7% year-over-year. The non-GAAP operating cash flow was $165 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. 
Our FX-adjusted DSO was 61 days, up 5 days from Q2 of last year, driven by business linearity. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $884 million, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus change in deferred revenue on the cash flows statement for the last 4 quarters. 
Now I will discuss our total backlog for Q2, which includes billed contracts from the balance sheet, the new ASC 606 performance obligation disclosures, and our backlog for time and materials service bookings. Total backlog was up 20% year-over-year in Q2 for an estimated balance of $3.3 billion in USD. Our backlog in the quarter was a result of our bookings performance, with all of our regions at double-digit growth year-over-year. As for the regional mix in the second quarter, 54% of our bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. The second quarter route to market mix was 77% from the channel and 23% from our direct sales force compared to second quarter prior year's split of 79% and 21%. 
Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 22 months, up nearly 1 month from Q2 last year. We attribute this to some customers choosing to extend their commitment to Red Hat with a longer-term strategic partnership. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally continued to weaken against the dollar year-over-year. 
I will begin with our full year guidance, which assumes an incremental FX headwind to revenue of $15 million as compared to our prior guidance. As a result, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.360 billion to $3.395 billion or a year-over-year growth range of 15% to 16% in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of 16% to 17%.
From a profitability perspective, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, which includes the necessary investments to drive future growth. 
We are planning an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for FY '19 prior to discrete items, and our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.45 to $3.49 per share. This assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 184 million diluted shares, which is lower due to share repurchases. 
Due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of any future convertible note settlements, our guidance will now be on the non-GAAP operating cash flow for FY '19. Excluding the repayments of convertible notes that are attributable to the debt discount, our outlook remains unchanged for the full year. Non-GAAP operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion, which includes an incremental $10 million in tax payments. 
For Q3, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $848 million to $856 million, which is up approximately 13% to 14% in USD and 15% to 16% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 with a 22.5% tax rate prior to discrete items. This assumes approximately $4 million in Q3 for net other income and 184 million diluted shares. 
We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections. 
Looking forward, we remain excited that Red Hat is increasingly viewed as a top strategic IT partner to the world's leading companies as they execute on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives and we remain committed to our customers success. David, at this point, please open up the call for questions."

The core business, customers are continuing to renew, we give you those numbers. The odd part, just to remind everyone, we started about 2.5 years ago focusing on trying to do multiyear deals to try to basically get our customers kind of into multiyear engagement, so our sales force could focus on net new. Well obviously 3 years, 2.5 years into that, yes, we've done our best of get people in 3-year deals. So our renewal base is quite small relative to where it's been in the past.

Certainly not in our sales area, because that's key area of investment and continued investment. So there was a little bit of cost management as we went through the quarter. Essentially as you think about the guide for the rest of the year, I expect the margin essentially to be flat as we go into Q3. And then it will pop up into Q4 because some of the marketing spend that we have will be actually done in Q3 versus Q4. So we're going to continue to actively manage the costs side. But at the same time too, I just want to emphasize that we are continuing to be very, very mindful about making the appropriate investments into our more strategic areas. So a lot of those investments come, as we get efficiencies and productivity, in other spaces within the company. So we absolutely will continue to invest in the strategic areas as we go through this year and certainly into next year. But we are taking a very active position, I am certainly, in terms of how we're managing the costs."

And then obviously this quarter, as we looked at the bookings in the billings, the renewal base continue to be a little bit of a headwind, as well as just reemphasizing both the project descope that was out of our control that was specific to the army, as well as this one loss -- this one competitive loss, they did also both have a fair amount of content for RHEL. so all of these impacted us for the quarter, which again gives us confidence that as we look at the pipeline, as we look at to go into the second half, we do see a reacceleration in the growth."

I mean a little bit on PaaS, I mean, I would say obviously the vast majority of our revenue is backed when we come into a quarter. So coming into Q1 where we were light than we wanted to be on billings and backlog, kind of rolled through this -- obviously we had a lot stronger quarter this quarter in growth there. And so we had some better visibility looking forward into RHEL. And so we do think this is kind of the bottom there. Related to PaaS, we're seeing great traction. I mean we had over 100 new customers for OpenShift. Not only is it customers, it's also partners. And so unlike some other software companies that will pay tens of millions of dollars to enable SIs, we focus on bottom-up demand generation. And so we've gotten really good bottom-up support for OpenShift. And now the large global system integrators are all building practices around OpenShift, and I think that also leads to an incremental traction. I think the Microsoft deal which we announced, the relationship that we announced back in Summit, is -- has raised awareness that it has helped as well. So I was in Europe last week. And I think out of that maybe 30 or so customer meetings I had, 20-something of them were about OpenShift in particular. It really is a topic that people want to understand and figure out how to do in containers. I would say, just editorial comment, I also think one of the things that has slowed RHEL growth a bit is customers want to talk about containers. And we need to continue to talk about RHEL is part of that portfolio. And I think the shiny object syndrome gets us all, the EMEA included, where we're talking about OpenShift and Ansible because there is so much traction around them. But overall, I -- it's hard to find a customer that's not looking at or starting to use OpenShift in some way, which is great to see."

I think we'll see as we get into next year, bluntly, the -- yes, I do think we'll see reaccelerate through this year. Exactly where that ends up, hard to exactly say. As we get into next year, we have a much larger renewal base. And since OpenShift's continuing its momentum, which I hope it does, I would say it can easily accelerate quite a bit. But we are running into a little bit of a sales capacity issue. And so the better OpenShift does and the more time we're spending on that, the less time we're selling RHEL. So the demand is clearly there, the market is clearly there. And so I mean given the size of the renewal base, I think it will expand a little bit more than that, but I want to be a little bit guarded just as people are -- there's just so much momentum around OpenShift right now, that it does kind of eat into selling time on RHEL. So clearly, the -- if you look at the overall trends from move of workloads to Windows to Linux and the overall growth of workloads certainly feel like it should reaccelerate above 10 and back into the teens. But again, our other products can at times start to push that out a little bit, which is part of the dynamic that we've seen with the strength that OpenShift affecting RHEL a bit. Now that's a long answer, but we feel really good about the macro trends around Linux. And it's about ability of us to have the bandwidth to pick it all up."

I've also been -- amazed is probably the wrong word, but really surprised at the amount of traction we're having on containers with those tail telcos as well. So it's not just a matter of the infrastructure, it's the application platform at the edge. If you have a 5G network, you kind of need applications at the edge. That's the differentiation that telcos have. So we have a significant amount of engineering effort working with the telcos on OpenShift as well. timing of that, again those deals continue to grow. We've had 14 deals with OpenStack over $1 million, which is up nicely from last year. Not all of those are in telco, but we did have some sizable telco wins.

So hard to say which of those actually kind of weighs out in terms of the emerging. I would say on balance that the team, they're going to say attach and growing cross-sell, upsell around the renewal is the more efficient way to see that growth.

Well, let me -- I'll start with the second, and I'll go to the first. over the last 3 years, we talked about the top 25 renewals of the -- each quarter, and that's 300 deals. We've only now lost 2. And the one that we lost, we did an even bigger middleware deal with after. When we lost people in the past, we have typically won them back. It sounds logical to say, ""Oh, I can get a cheaper price for my Linux.""  But what production customers find is they don't get that quality of software and certainly not support that they get from us. And so honestly, I don't mind losing one every now and then. If we win them all, then we're probably overpricing. And we have a really good track record of winning them back as they've had a chance to experience the other. And so given that that and how rare the losses are and how often the losses have come back, and even they come reference customers for us. We also always want to take competitors seriously. But in terms of over looking at this one deal, I wouldn't kind of overly focus on that relative to our long-term history of competing with others. In terms of middleware, you hit on a good point. the same way that we did multiyear deals on RHEL, lots of those deals on stand-alone JBoss deals were multiyear deals 3 years ago as well. So there was a lot of renewal on JBoss coming up for next year as well. And so again, that's -- that will be a good opportunity for us to continue to expand those."

And you currently become, very relative in those markets,  leading them. But -- and this is asked in a respectful manner, it's really usually not a good sign when a growth business starts to talk about the effects of the renewal cycle, the reasons of moderating growth. And I'm just I think a lot of us are just wondering is there something else happening there in the Linux business? And I don't know. I don't know what it could be. like there's people have fear at times that people are going to start in the public cloud, start to use sort of the free versions or not unpaid Linux. is there a saturation on-premise? Is there anything else happening here? Or is it really -- or is that just sort in this renewal cycle?"

I was beginning to think somebody was impersonating you. So I appreciate that. But no, seriously on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is because we've always talked about how we get into a customer. And our business grows with them, and that almost always that growth happens when we step up that renewal time. And for a long time, we were more focused on doing 1-year deals than doing multiyear deals. And so every year, each of those deals would ratchet up. Well, and I still think it's the right decision. 2.5 years ago, we decided to focus more on doing multiyear deals, so we could get the customers locked into a set of technologies on which we could then go work to upsell, which we do. But the problem with that is that's been doing that for 2.5 years, you've drained a lot of the swamp of potential renewal, which means a deal we did making it up last year that had 20% growth. well that growth roll into revenue this year is 0. And the deal we did 2 years ago that had 20-something percent growth in it is rolling through revenue flat this year. And we just don't have as many renewals, because these are the people that we couldn't get in 3-year deals in the last 2 years, that are up now. And so yes, we see good growth. And we talked about since that one competitive loss, we still see solid upsell and cross-sell in our renewals when they come up. But the renewal is typically the precipitating event to do with the upsell and cross-sell as well. Certainly, that's not always the case. We have people in multiyear deals. We have multiple other deals with them. But that renewal is that participating event. Then we just -- it's a lot lower, which if you actually ask our sales team, the amount of net new growth that they have to get this year, they're seeing growth numbers 30%, 40%, 50% depending on the region, which given I don't want to say renewals are automatic. Obviously we don't have a very high renewal rate. That amount of new business that they're seeing is like dramatically higher in terms of the new business that they have to go get and are going and getting, than you're seeing in our revenue or even our bookings numbers, because of just kind of the relatively lower renewal rate. So that's why you hear us talking about it. It's not that we're ""milking"" the renewal. It's just we don't have the precipitating events as often as we typically do. And again, that starts to come back next year, because we get into the steady state of -- from  3 years ago, those renewals coming back around.  I don't think there's a change in focus on what we're doing. it's just the sheer math of how much business we have that we can cross-sell and upsell on."

And if you think about the customer engagement that we have, even looking at the CCSP program, our online program, we're harvesting those opportunities for future growth opportunities. So it starts with an our customers already using RHEL from a technology perspective, it's a whole lot easier of a conversation since they're already using our OS, to then start using OpenShift, especially as they're going to start containerizing their applications. So it really is more of a technology discussion and why it makes sense. So it's not just the fact that we're going back to the same customers, but it really is, as Jim said, a business event that makes it much easier for them to leverage newer technology."

In the second quarter, we continued to see demand from our customers around the globe as they focus on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives. We enable our customers to succeed on these initiatives with our innovative solutions, award-winning support and global services. Our focus on customers helped us drive strong results in the second quarter where we delivered double digit growth in a number of our key financial metrics. Let me highlight a few of those for the quarter.
Our total backlog, driven by strong bookings, grew 20% year-over-year. Our major geographic regions each grew bookings at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenues grew more than 30% year-over-year. And our services revenue, led by demand for OpenShift and Ansible consulting and training, grew 19% year-over-year in constant currency.
Now let me give you some business metrics and highlights that demonstrate our continued traction with our customers and partners. Looking at our deals over $1 million this quarter, we closed a total of 73 deals over $1 million, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Within these deals, 11 were greater than $5 million, which is a record in a Q2 for us, and 1 deal was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was strong in this cohort, over 76% of the top deals greater than $1 million included 1 or more components of our Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. One of the deals over $5 million was the largest services deal we have every closed in a quarter. This deal is with a global bank that is digitally transforming their payments business based on our integration middleware. Other top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were financials services and the government sector.
Looking at our top deals. 24 out of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal did so at an aggregate value of more than 100% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is a rare competitive loss to a legacy on-premise provider based on pricing. We're actively pursuing future business with this customer as they evaluate additional technologies such as adopting OpenShift as a multi-cloud platform for the digital transformation of their business. Removing the one lost deal and using the next largest deal that did renew, the adjusted top 25 deals for the quarter would have renewed at an aggregate value of approximately 115% of their previous value.
Looking more broadly across our customer base at 2 of our fastest growing technologies, OpenShift and Ansible, let me provide you with some recent achievements that demonstrate the momentum we're seeing with our customers and partners. Last week, we announced a multi-partner relationship with Hortonworks and IBM Cloud Private to bring their big data and analytics products onto OpenShift. This is designed to enable customers to develop and run data-intensive applications on OpenShift, bringing them the power of hybrid cloud. Our Ansible technology reached approximately 2 million managed nodes at the end of Q2, essentially doubling the number of managed nodes since Q4 of last year. Overall, both of these technologies added nearly 100 new customers each since Q1, and we continue to grow the median revenue per customer.
In summary, we continue to drive significant adoption of our hybrid cloud technologies even as we worked through the headwinds in middleware and our renewal base that we view and have previously disclosed -- or discussed. We remain confident in our long-term competitive position and our proven ability to become increasingly strategic with our customers as evidenced by our growth over the past several quarters with large customer engagements and momentum with our partners.
I want to thank Red Hat associates for their tireless efforts in serving our customers. From building innovative solutions to delivering and supporting these technologies, we continue to stay focused on the success of our customers and delivering value every day.
With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed. Red Hat's ability to deliver business value has been a key driver to building a multi-billion-dollar business, and the strength of our strategic customer relationships is one of the reasons we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Our performance this quarter was driven by the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies, which enabled us to deliver results that were in line with our guidance.
As a result of our performance to date and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth in constant currency at 16% to 17%, along with our full year non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow. However, in U.S. dollars, we are lowering the full year revenue range by approximately $15 million to account solely for the change in FX rates, as the trend of weaker rates against the dollar for many of the major foreign currencies has continued to decline in recent months.
For instance, Q2 total revenue would have been nearly $3 million higher using the FX rates from my June guidance. As such, for this call, I will discuss our results in both USD and constant currency to provide a full view of the impacts of foreign currency on our results. A more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our -- for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP is included in our earnings press release.
I will now review our Q2 performance and business metrics before finishing with our outlook for Q3 and the rest of FY '19. In the second quarter, we delivered $823 million of total revenue, which was in line with guidance and represented growth of 14% in both USD and constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, this result of USD included a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $3 million from the rates used for guidance in June.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, made up 88% of total revenue in Q2 and grew 13% in USD or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $527 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. This result was impacted by the lower available renewal base, which is largely RHEL and the lower renewal value that Jim discussed in our top 25 renewals metric. Year-to-date, our infrastructure-related offerings are up 11% in USD and 10% in constant currency.
Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $196 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. Within this portfolio, we continue to drive rapid growth in our emerging technologies, particularly in Ansible and OpenShift. As we discussed in the past, this growth has become somewhat offset by the moderation we are experiencing in our middleware offerings. We continue to believe that as customers shift their workloads to container environments, our middleware results and subscription revenue will benefit in the long run. Overall, Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 24% of total revenue, up 300 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
Lastly, our services revenue of $100 million grew 17% year-over-year in USD or 19% in constant currency. The strong growth of our services business was driven by demand for training and consulting projects for our Ansible and OpenShift offerings. As I have mentioned before, our services business is both a leading and lagging indicator for the demand around our emerging products. We have seen that customers who buy both services and subscriptions tend to have higher retention, which can lead to future opportunities and additional technology sales.
Before we move to our non-GAAP operating income results, as a reminder, our non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Non-GAAP EPS adjusts for all these items as well as noncash interest expense related to the debt discount.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 operating income of $197 million grew 3% year-over-year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. This quarterly result was 90 basis points higher than my June guidance and reflects some repositioning of hiring and marketing programs to the second half of the fiscal year. Net other income was $4 million and in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter, which includes discrete tax benefits and the impact from certain nondeductible share-based compensation expense. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, up 10% year-over-year and above my guidance as a result of the higher non-GAAP operating margin.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $341 million, representing growth of 17% in USD or 19% in constant currency over the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $250 million or 1.7 million shares under our new share repurchase authorization, which has a remaining balance of approximately $750 million. In addition, we had approximately $245 million of total cash outflows related to repayment of convertible notes.
Moving to operating cash flow, with the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-'15: Statement of Cash Flows, which requires us to classify the portion of the repayment of convertible notes attributable to debt discount as an operating cash flow as opposed to financing cash outflow. In an effort to appropriately reflect the cash generated from the operations of the business and for comparability of prior periods, we will provide both a GAAP and non-GAAP operating cash flow metric.
Our GAAP operating cash flow, inclusive of the $32 million of repayments for the convertible notes attributable to the debt discount, was $133 million, down 7% year-over-year. The non-GAAP operating cash flow was $165 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year.
Our FX-adjusted DSO was 61 days, up 5 days from Q2 of last year, driven by business linearity. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $884 million, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Now I will discuss our total backlog for Q2, which includes billed contracts from the balance sheet, the new ASC 606 performance obligation disclosures, and our backlog for time and materials service bookings. Total backlog was up 20% year-over-year in Q2 for an estimated balance of $3.3 billion in USD. Our backlog in the quarter was the result of our bookings performance with all of our regions at double-digit growth year-over-year. As for the regional mix in the second quarter, 54% of our bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. The second quarter route-to-market mix was 77% from the channel and 23% from our direct sales force compared to second quarter prior year's split of 79% and 21%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 22 months, up nearly 1 month from Q2 last year. We attribute this to some customers choosing to extend their commitment to Red Hat with a longer-term strategic partnership.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally continued to weaken against the dollar year-over-year.
I will begin with our full year guidance, which assumes an incremental FX headwind to revenue of $15 million as compared to our prior guidance. As a result, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.360 billion to $3.395 billion or a year-over-year growth range of 15% to 16% in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of 16% to 17%.
From a profitability perspective, we are reconfirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, which includes the necessary investments to drive future growth. We are planning an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for FY '19 prior to discrete items and our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.45 to $3.49 per share. This assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 184 million diluted shares, which is lower due to share repurchases.
Due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of any future convertible note settlements, our guidance will now be on the non-GAAP operating cash flow for FY '19. Excluding the repayments of convertible notes that are attributable to the debt discount, our outlook remains unchanged for the full year. Non-GAAP operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion, which includes an incremental $10 million in tax payments.
For Q3, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $848 million to $856 million, which is up approximately 13% to 14% in USD and 15% to 16% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 with a 22.5% tax rate prior to discrete items. This assumes approximately $4 million in Q3 for net other income and 184 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Looking forward, we remain excited that Red Hat is increasingly viewed as a top strategic IT partner to the world's leading companies as they execute on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives, and we remain committed to our customers' success. David, at this point, please open up the call for questions."

So yes -- and a lot of that, we believe, is new business. The core business, customers are continuing to renew, we give you those numbers. The odd part, again, just to remind everyone, we started about 2.5 years ago focusing on trying to do multi-year deals to try to basically kind of get our customers kind of into multi-year engagements, so our sales force could focus on net new. Well, obviously, 3 years -- 2.5 years into that, we've done our best to get people in 3-year deals. So our renewal base is quite small relative to where it's been in the past. And it's at renewal when we typically take up the size of those relationships. So fewer renewals means less takeup in these last couple of quarters. But again, I mean we're seeing it from both.

So there was a little bit of cost management as we went through the quarter. Essentially, as you think about the guide for the rest of the year, I expect the margin essentially to be flat as we go into Q3. And then it will pop up into Q4 because some of the marketing spend that we have will be actually done in Q3 versus Q4. So we're going to continue to actively manage the cost side. But at the same time too, I just want to emphasize that we are continuing to be very, very mindful about making the appropriate investments into our more strategic areas.

So coming out of Q1, where we were light on where we wanted to be on billings and backlog, kind of rolled through this -- obviously, we had a lot stronger quarter this quarter in growth there. And so we have some better visibility looking forward into RHEL. And so we do think this is kind of the bottom there. Related to PaaS, we're seeing great traction. I mean, we have over 100 new customers for OpenShift. Not only is it customers. It's also partners. And so unlike some other software companies that will pay tens of millions of dollars to enable SIs, we focus on bottom-up demand generation. And so we've gotten really good bottom-up support for OpenShift. And now the large global system integrators are all building practices around OpenShift, and I think that also leads to incremental traction. I think the Microsoft deal, which we announced -- the relationship that we announced back at Summit, is -- has raised awareness and has helped as well. So I was in Europe last week, and I think out of the maybe 30 or so customer meetings I had, 20 something of them were about OpenShift in particular. It really is a topic that people want to understand and figure how to do in containers. I will say just editorial comment. I also think one of the things that has slowed RHEL growth a bit is customers want to talk about containers, and we need to continue to talk about RHEL as part of that portfolio. And I do think the shiny object syndrome gets us all, the EMEA included, where we're talking about OpenShift and Ansible because there is so much traction around them. But overall, I've -- hard to find a customer that's not looking at or starting to use OpenShift in some way, which is great to see."

I think we'll see, as we get into next year, bluntly, the -- yes, I do think we'll see it reaccelerate through this year. Exactly where that ends up, hard to exactly say. As we get into next year, we have a much larger renewal base. And since OpenShift's continuing its momentum, which I hope it does, I would say it can easily accelerate quite a bit. But we are running into a little bit of a sales capacity issue, and so the better OpenShift does and the more time we're spending on that, the less time we're selling RHEL. So the demand's clearly there. The market's clearly there. And so given the size of the renewal base, I think it'll expand more than that, but I want to be a little bit guarded just as people are -- there's just so much momentum around OpenShift right now that it does kind of eat into selling time on RHEL. So clearly, the -- if you look at the overall trends on the move of workloads from Windows to Linux and the overall growth of workloads, certainly feel like it should reaccelerate above well above 10% and back into the teens. But again, our other products can, at times, start to push that out a little bit, which is I think part of the dynamic that we've seen with the strength at OpenShift affecting RHEL a bit. Now that's a long answer, but we feel really good about the macro trends around Linux. And it's just about ability of us to have the bandwidth to pick it all up."

That's the differentiator that telcos have. So we have a significant amount of engineering effort working with the telcos on OpenShift as well. The timing of that, again, those deals continue to grow. We had 14 deals with OpenStack over $1 million, which is up nicely from last year. Not all of those are in telco, though we did have some sizable telco wins. And we have, I think, 4 significant NFV wins with telcos in the quarter.

So certainly, if we have a customer that comes in the second half of this year where they have something that's going to renew next year, but if they come to us and say, gee, we like to do a bigger engagement and we like to infuse some OpenShift or OpenStack, et cetera, we absolutely will do that deal. And that will throw some of this off, and there's a fair amount of that as it happens. Certainly, the one thing we're not going to do is pull in deals ourselves. But if a customer has a business need and they want to expand their scope with us, we absolutely will entertain those. So barring any big co-terms happening in the second half of this year, I would say, in your models, I would assume the latter part of Q1 and then really as you get into Q2 onwards is when you'll see it pick back up."

But some of the time on that deal is spent on the renewal of the components around it, where the reason we originally started 2.5 years ago trying to get people in these 3-year deals is it frees up more time to go sell net new. Now the net new may not be as efficient to sell and it may be shorter like 1-year deals, but it does -- it kind of creates more kind of clarity and focus in our go-to-market organization. So hard to say which of those actually kind of weighs out in terms of the emerging. I would say on balance [ perhaps ] the team, they're going to say attach and growing cross-sell, upsell around the renewal is the more efficient way to see that grow. But again, it is more sales time spent on that renewal as well than on the new business. So there might be a little bit of an impact there in terms of accelerating the other associated with it. But the big impact is those renewals just typically grow when we give you the data on that. So bigger renewal base does a lot to especially help RHEL growth."

So beyond the existing renewal base that we have, part of what we're doing very intentionality is going to that next tier of customers to be able to get certainly and grow an additional set of enterprise customers as we go forward. So some of this is going to be layering it on. But I think, as Jim said, I mean, I think there is nice cross-selling opportunities across the board with the existing renewal base that we have."

Look, over the last 3 years, we talked about the top 25 renewals of the -- each quarter, and that's 300 deals. We've only now lost 2. And the one that we lost, we did an even bigger middleware deal with after. When we've lost people in the past, we have typically won them back. It sounds logical to say, ""Oh, I can get a cheaper price for my Linux.""  But what production customers find is they don't get that quality of software and certainly not support that they get from us. And so honestly, I don't mind losing one every now and then. If we win them all, then we're probably underpricing. And we have a really good track record of winning them back after they've had a chance to experience the other. And so given that and how rare the losses are and how often the losses have come back and even become reference customers for us, we always want to take competitors seriously. But in terms of over looking at this one deal, I wouldn't kind of overly focus on that relative to our long-term history of competing with others. In terms of middleware, I think you hit on a good point. In the same way that we did multi-year deals on RHEL, a lot of those deals and stand-alone JBoss deals were multi-year deals 3 years ago as well. And so there's a lot of renewal on JBoss coming up next year as well. And so again, that's -- that'll be a good opportunity for us to continue to expand those."

I was beginning to think that somebody was impersonating you. I appreciate that. But no, seriously, on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is we have always talked about how we get into a customer, and our business grows with them. And that almost always that growth happens when we step up that renewal time. And for a long time, we were more focused on doing 1-year deals than doing multi-year deals. And so every year, each of those deals would ratchet up. Well -- and I still think it's the right decision, 2.5 years ago, we decided to focus more on doing multi-year deals, so we could get the customers locked into a set of technologies on which we could then go work to upsell, which we do. But the problem with that is after you've been doing that for 2.5 years, you've drained a lot of the swamp of potential renewal, which means a deal we did making it up last year that had 20% growth, well, that growth rolling through revenue this year is 0. And the deal we did 2 years ago that had 20-something percent growth in it is rolling through revenue flat this year. And we just don't have as many renewals because these are the people we couldn't get in 3-year deals in the last 2 years that are up now. And so yes, we see good growth, and we talked about, since that one competitive loss, we still see solid upsell and cross-sell in our renewals when they come up. But the renewal is typically the precipitating event to do the upsell and cross-sell. And while certainly that's not always the case, we have people in multi-year deals. We have multiple other deals with them. But the renewal is that precipitating event, and we just -- it's a lot lower, which if you actually ask our sales teams the amount of net new growth that they have to get this year, they're seeing growth numbers 30%, 40%, 50% depending on the region, which given -- I don't want to say renewals are automatic. Obviously we have a very high renewal rate. That amount of new business that they're seeing is like dramatically higher in terms of the new business that they have to go get and are going and getting than you're seeing in our revenue or even our bookings numbers because of just the kind of the relatively lower renewal rate. So that's why you hear us talking about. It's not that we're ""milking"" the renewal. It's just we don't have the precipitating events as often as we typically do. And again, that starts to come back next year because we get into the steady state of the -- from 3 years ago, those renewals coming back around. I don't think there's a change in focus on what we're doing. It's just the sheer math of how much business we have that we can cross sell and upsell on."

If anything, we continue to gain share from our on-premise competitors. And again, just looking cloud for cloud and our relative RHEL growth rates in those clouds versus their overall growth rates, I don't think we're losing share to whether it's Amazon Linux or any of the other Linuxes out there. So I don't see a place where we are losing share. Again, a lot of this, you're getting the math of the fact that many of our customers are in 3-year engagements that aren't growing. So you're getting this weighted average thing, and we're in the year before the renewals restart. So I don't know. I don't see us losing share at all. If anything, I see us gaining share. And again, maintaining share on public cloud as public cloud grows is also taking share because that's vast majority Linux and -- versus on-premise where nearly half of the workloads are Windows. So overall, I feel very, very good about where we stand with Linux and how we're growing. What's the second part of that?"

To be clear, CoreOS is different than Ansible in the sense that Ansible was an additional product that has done extremely well for us. CoreOS is a set of features in a container platform that we are integrating into OpenShift. The CoreOS team focused on ease of use from the user's perspective. We bring incredible content associated with RHEL in the RHEL ecosystem and how we life cycle. Those, together, it's a phenomenal marriage. We've started to bring some of those technologies in into OpenShift in the various dot releases. And certainly, as we get into Openshift 4, you'll see kind of, say, basically the entirety of their core feature set integrated in. And we're really excited about it. I think that's one of the reasons that we're seeing so much traction with OpenShift today."

We enable",676,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. In the second quarter, we continued to see demand from our customers around the globe as they focus on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives. We enable our customers to succeed on these initiatives with our innovative solutions, award-winning support and global services. Our focus on customers helped us drive strong results in the second quarter where we delivered double-digit growth in a number of our key financial metrics. Let me highlight a few of those for the quarter.
Our total backlog, driven by strong bookings, grew 20% year-over-year. Our major geographic regions each grew bookings at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenues grew more than 30% year-over-year. And our services revenue, led by demand for OpenShift and Ansible consulting and training, grew 19% year-over-year in constant currency.
Now let me give you some business metrics and highlights that demonstrate our continued traction with our customers and partners. Looking at our deals over $1 million this quarter, we closed a total of 73 deals over $1 million, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Within these deals, 11 were greater than $5 million, which is a record in a Q2 for us, and 1 deal was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was strong in this cohort, over 76% of the top deals greater than $1 million including 1 or more components of our Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. One of the deals over $5 million was the largest services deal we have ever closed in a quarter. This deal is with a global bank that is digitally transforming their payments business based on our integration middleware. Other top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were financial services and the government sector.
Looking at our top deals. 24 out of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal did so at an aggregate value of more than 100% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is a rare competitive loss to a legacy on-premise provider based on pricing. We're actively pursuing future business with this customer as they evaluate additional technologies such as adopting OpenShift as a multi-cloud platform for the digital transformation of their business. Removing the one lost deal and using the next largest deal that did renew, the adjusted top 25 deals for the quarter would have renewed at an aggregate value of approximately 115% of their previous value.
Looking more broadly across our customer base at 2 of our fastest growing technologies, OpenShift and Ansible, let me provide you with some recent achievements that demonstrate the momentum we're seeing with our customers and partners. Last week, we announced a multi-partner relationship with Hortonworks and IBM Cloud Private to bring their big data and analytics products onto OpenShift. This is designed to enable customers to develop and run data-intensive applications on OpenShift, bringing them the power of hybrid cloud. Our Ansible technology reached approximately 2 million managed nodes at the end of Q2, essentially doubling the number of managed nodes since Q4 of last year. Overall, both of these technologies added nearly 100 new customers each since Q1, and we continue to grow the median revenue per customer.
In summary, we continue to drive significant adoption of our hybrid cloud technologies even as we worked through the headwinds in middleware and our renewal base that we view and have previously disclosed -- or discussed. We remain confident in our long-term competitive position and our proven ability to become increasingly strategic with our customers as evidenced by our growth over the past several quarters with large customer engagements and momentum with our partners.
I want to thank Red Hat associates for their tireless efforts in serving our customers. From building innovative solutions to delivering and supporting these technologies, we continue to stay focused on the success of our customers and delivering value every day.
With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed. Red Hat's ability to deliver business value has been a key driver to building a multi-billion-dollar business, and the strength of our strategic customer relationships is one of the reasons we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Our performance this quarter was driven by the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies, which enabled us to deliver results that were in line with our guidance.
As a result of our performance to date and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth in constant currency at 16% to 17%, along with our full year non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow. However, in U.S. dollars, we are lowering the full year revenue range by approximately $15 million to account solely for the change in FX rates, as the trend of weaker rates against the dollar for many of the major foreign currencies has continued to decline in recent months.
For instance, Q2 total revenue would have been nearly $3 million higher using the FX rates from my June guidance. As such, for this call, I will discuss our results in both USD and constant currency to provide a full view of the impacts of foreign currency on our results. A more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our -- for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP is included in our earnings press release.
I will now review our Q2 performance and business metrics before finishing with our outlook for Q3 and the rest of FY '19. In the second quarter, we delivered $823 million of total revenue, which was in line with guidance and represented growth of 14% in both USD and constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, this result of USD included a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $3 million from the rates used for guidance in June.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, made up 88% of total revenue in Q2 and grew 13% in USD or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $527 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. This result was impacted by the lower available renewal base, which is largely RHEL and the lower renewal value that Jim discussed in our top 25 renewals metric. Year-to-date, our infrastructure-related offerings are up 11% in USD and 10% in constant currency.
Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $196 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. Within this portfolio, we continue to drive rapid growth in our emerging technologies, particularly in Ansible and OpenShift. As we discussed in the past, this growth has become somewhat offset by the moderation we are experiencing in our middleware offerings. We continue to believe that as customers shift their workloads to container environments, our middleware results and subscription revenue will benefit in the long run. Overall, Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 24% of total revenue, up 300 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
Lastly, our services revenue of $100 million grew 17% year-over-year in USD or 19% in constant currency. The strong growth of our services business was driven by demand for training and consulting projects for our Ansible and OpenShift offerings. As I have mentioned before, our services business is both a leading and lagging indicator for the demand around our emerging products. We have seen that customers who buy both services and subscriptions tend to have higher retention, which can lead to future opportunities and additional technology sales.
Before we move to our non-GAAP operating income results, as a reminder, our non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Non-GAAP EPS adjusts for all these items as well as noncash interest expense related to the debt discount.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 operating income of $197 million grew 3% year-over-year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. This quarterly result was 90 basis points higher than my June guidance and reflects some repositioning of hiring and marketing programs to the second half of the fiscal year. Net other income was $4 million and in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter, which includes discrete tax benefits and the impact from certain nondeductible share-based compensation expense. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, up 10% year-over-year and above my guidance as a result of the higher non-GAAP operating margin.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $341 million, representing growth of 17% in USD or 19% in constant currency over the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $250 million or 1.7 million shares under our new share repurchase authorization, which has a remaining balance of approximately $750 million. In addition, we had approximately $245 million of total cash outflows related to repayment of convertible notes.
Moving to operating cash flow. With the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-15: Statement of Cash Flows, which requires us to classify the portion of the repayment of convertible notes attributable to debt discount as an operating cash flow as opposed to financing cash outflow. In an effort to appropriately reflect the cash generated from the operations of the business and for comparability of prior periods, we will provide both a GAAP and non-GAAP operating cash flow metric.
Our GAAP operating cash flow, inclusive of the $32 million of repayments for the convertible notes attributable to the debt discount, was $133 million, down 7% year-over-year. The non-GAAP operating cash flow was $165 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year.
Our FX-adjusted DSO was 61 days, up 5 days from Q2 of last year, driven by business linearity. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $884 million, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Now I will discuss our total backlog for Q2, which includes billed contracts from the balance sheet, the new ASC 606 performance obligation disclosures, and our backlog for time and materials service bookings. Total backlog was up 20% year-over-year in Q2 for an estimated balance of $3.3 billion in USD. Our backlog in the quarter was the result of our bookings performance with all of our regions at double-digit growth year-over-year. As for the regional mix in the second quarter, 54% of our bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. The second quarter route-to-market mix was 77% from the channel and 23% from our direct sales force compared to second quarter prior year's split of 79% and 21%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 22 months, up nearly 1 month from Q2 last year. We attribute this to some customers choosing to extend their commitment to Red Hat with a longer-term strategic partnership.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally continued to weaken against the dollar year-over-year.
I will begin with our full year guidance, which assumes an incremental FX headwind to revenue of $15 million as compared to our prior guidance. As a result, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.360 billion to $3.395 billion or a year-over-year growth range of 15% to 16% in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of 16% to 17%.
From a profitability perspective, we are reconfirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, which includes the necessary investments to drive future growth. We are planning an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for FY '19 prior to discrete items and our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.45 to $3.49 per share. This assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 184 million diluted shares, which is lower due to share repurchases.
Due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of any future convertible note settlements, our guidance will now be on the non-GAAP operating cash flow for FY '19. Excluding the repayments of convertible notes that are attributable to the debt discount, our outlook remains unchanged for the full year. Non-GAAP operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion, which includes an incremental $10 million in tax payments.
For Q3, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $848 million to $856 million, which is up approximately 13% to 14% in USD and 15% to 16% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 with a 22.5% tax rate prior to discrete items. This assumes approximately $4 million in Q3 for net other income and 184 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Looking forward, we remain excited that Red Hat is increasingly viewed as a top strategic IT partner to the world's leading companies as they execute on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives, and we remain committed to our customers' success. David, at this point, please open up the call for questions."

So we had a couple of components other than just the lower renewal base.

So yes -- and a lot of that, we believe, is new business. The core business, customers are continuing to renew, we give you those numbers. The odd part, again, just to remind everyone, we started about 2.5 years ago focusing on trying to do multi-year deals to try to basically kind of get our customers kind of into multi-year engagements, so our sales force could focus on net new. Well, obviously, 3 years -- 2.5 years into that, yes, we've done our best to get people in 3-year deals. So our renewal base is quite small relative to where it's been in the past. And it's at renewal when we typically take up the size of those relationships. So fewer renewals means less takeup in these last couple of quarters. But again, I mean we're seeing it from both. We still see a lot of growth with our existing customers. And as we talked about in the past, customers who are adopting cloud tend to grow their RHEL footprints faster than those who aren't."

And a lot of that is the new products, like we're seeing -- really, really pleased with OpenShift and with Ansible. We talked about adding -- we don't break those numbers out, but adding over 100 customers each in the quarter is pretty significant and shows the size of that momentum. We didn't give a lot of stats on OpenStack, but it continued to grow nicely as well. So across all 3 of those, we're seeing some really nice growth and really, really good traction. Yes.

So there was a bit of -- certainly, as you go through the quarter and as we talked about this one competitive loss, it was not lost until the very end of the quarter. So we were certainly fighting to keep this until the end of the quarter. However, having said that, as you can imagine, as we look at some of the other trends in the business, we did a slight pullback in certain areas, certainly not in our sales area because that's a key area of investment and continued investment. So there was a little bit of cost management as we went through the quarter. Essentially, as you think about the guide for the rest of the year, I expect the margin essentially to be flat as we go into Q3. And then it will pop up into Q4 because some of the marketing spend that we have will be actually done in Q3 versus Q4. So we're going to continue to actively manage the cost side. But at the same time too, I just want to emphasize that we are continuing to be very, very mindful about making the appropriate investments into our more strategic areas. So a lot of those investments come, as we get efficiencies and productivities, in other spaces and -- within the company. So we absolutely will continue to invest in the strategic areas as we go through this year and certainly into next year. But we are taking a very active position, I am certainly, in terms of how we're managing the cost."

So -- and then obviously, this quarter, as we looked at the bookings and the billings, the renewal base continued to be a bit of a headwind as well as just reemphasizing both this project descope that was out of our control that was specific to the army as well as this one loss -- this one competitive loss. They did also both have a fair amount of content of RHEL. So all of these impacted us in the current quarter, which, again, gives us confidence that, as we look at the pipeline, as we look at -- we go into second half, we do see a reacceleration of the growth."

So coming out of Q1, where we were light on where we wanted to be on billings and backlog, kind of rolled through this -- obviously, we had a lot stronger quarter this quarter in growth there. And so we have some better visibility looking forward into RHEL. And so we do think this is kind of the bottom there. Related to PaaS, we're seeing great traction. I mean, we have over 100 new customers for OpenShift. Not only is it customers. It's also partners. And so unlike some other software companies that will pay tens of millions of dollars to enable SIs, we focus on bottom-up demand generation. And so we've gotten really good bottom-up support for OpenShift. And now the large global system integrators are all building practices around OpenShift, and I think that also leads to incremental traction. I think the Microsoft deal, which we announced -- the relationship that we announced back at Summit, is -- has raised awareness and has helped as well. So I was in Europe last week, and I think out of the maybe 30 or so customer meetings I had, 20 something of them were about OpenShift in particular. It really is a topic that people want to understand and figure out how to do in containers. I will say just editorial comment. I also think one of the things that has slowed RHEL growth a bit is customers want to talk about containers, and we need to continue to talk about RHEL is part of that portfolio. And I do think shiny object syndrome gets us all, me included, where we're talking about OpenShift and Ansible because there is so much traction around them. But overall, I've -- hard to find a customer that's not looking at or starting to use OpenShift in some way, which is great to see."

I do think we'll see it reaccelerate through this year. Exactly where that ends up, hard to exactly say. As we get into next year, we have a much larger renewal base. And since OpenShift's continuing its momentum, which I hope it does, I would say it can easily accelerate quite a bit. But we are running into a little bit of a sales capacity issue. And so the better OpenShift does and the more time we're spending on that, the less time we're selling RHEL. So the demand's clearly there. The market's clearly there. And so given the size of the renewal base, I think it'll expand more than that, but I want to be a little bit guarded just as people are -- there's just so much momentum around OpenShift right now that it does kind of eat into selling time on RHEL. So clearly, the -- if you look at the overall trends on the move of workloads from Windows to Linux and the overall growth of workloads, certainly feel like it should reaccelerate above well above 10% and back into the teens. But again, our other products can, at times, kind of start to push that out a little bit, which is I think part of the dynamic that we've seen with the strength at OpenShift affecting RHEL a bit. Now that's a long answer, but we feel really good about the macro trends around Linux. And it's just about ability of us to have the bandwidth to pick it all up."

That's the differentiator that telcos have. So we have a significant amount of engineering effort working with the telcos on OpenShift as well. The timing of that, again, those deals continue to grow. We had 14 deals with OpenStack over $1 million, which is up nicely from last year. Not all of those are in telco, though we did have some sizable telco wins. And we have, I think, 4 significant NFV wins with telcos in the quarter.

So unfortunately, it was this competitive loss to a legacy on-prem provider and certainly was unfortunate. But as Jim said, we're already working some new leads with this customer. But it really had to do with just the way the revenue would have been trued up."

So Mark, as we're looking at it, I would tell you the latter part of the first quarter, certainly as we get into the second quarter, you'll start to see the renewals pick up. Now I say that, and as I've mentioned previously, one of the things that makes the renewals analysis challenging for all of us is that assumes that customers don't come to us and decide that they want to co-term something early. So certainly, if we have a customer that comes in the second half of this year where they have something that's going to renew next year, but if they come to us and say, gee, we'd like to do a bigger engagement and we like to infuse some OpenShift or OpenStack, et cetera, we absolutely will do that deal. And that will throw some of this off, and there's a fair amount of that as it happens. Certainly, the one thing we're not going to do is pull in deals ourselves. But if a customer has a business need and they want to expand their scope with us, we absolutely will entertain those. So barring any big co-terms happening in the second half of this year, I would say, in your models, I would assume the latter part of Q1 and then really as you get into Q2 onwards is when you'll see it pick back up."

The reason I -- I mean, it's -- we really like the renewal because that's the time to cross sell and upsell, which is really, really nice. But some of the time on that deal is spent on the renewal of the components around it, where the reason we originally started 2.5 years ago trying to get people in these 3-year deals is it frees up more time to go sell net new. Now the net new may not be as efficient to sell and it may be shorter like 1-year deals, but it does -- it kind of creates more kind of clarity and focus in our go-to-market organization. So hard to say which of those actually kind of weighs out in terms of the emerging. I would say on [ balance perhaps ] the team, they're going to say attach and growing cross-sell, upsell around the renewal is the more efficient way to see that grow. But again, it is more sales time spent on that renewal as well than on the new business. So there might be a little bit of an impact there in terms of accelerating the other associated with it. But the big impact is those renewals just typically grow and we've given you the data on that. So bigger renewal base does a lot to especially help RHEL growth."

So beyond the existing renewal base that we have, part of what we're doing very intentionality is going to that next tier of customers to be able to get certainly and grow an additional set of enterprise customers as we go forward. So some of this is going to be layering it on. But I think, as Jim said, I mean, I think there is nice cross-selling opportunities across the board with the existing renewal base that we have."

Look, over the last 3 years, we talked about the top 25 renewals of the -- each quarter, and that's 300 deals. We've only now lost 2. And the one that we lost, we did an even bigger middleware deal with after. When we've lost people in the past, we have typically won them back. It sounds logical to say, ""Oh, I can get a cheaper price for my Linux.""  But what production customers find is they don't get that quality of software and certainly not support that they get from us. And so honestly, I don't mind losing one every now and then. If we win them all, then we're probably underpricing. And we have a really good track record of winning them back after they've had a chance to experience the other. And so given that and how rare the losses are and how often the losses have come back and even become reference customers for us, we always want to take competitors seriously. But in terms of over looking at this one deal, I wouldn't kind of overly focus on that relative to our long-term history of competing with others. In terms of middleware, I think you hit on a good point. In the same way that we did multi-year deals on RHEL, a lot of those deals and stand-alone JBoss deals were multi-year deals 3 years ago as well. And so there's a lot of renewal on JBoss coming up next year as well. And so again, that's -- that'll be a good opportunity for us to continue to expand those."

It's really usually not a good sign when a growth business starts to talk about the effects of renewal cycles, the reasons of moderating growth. And I'm just -- I think a lot of us are just wondering, is there something else happening here in the Linux business? And I don't know. I don't know what it could be. Like there's -- people have feared at times that people are going to start in the public cloud, start to use sort of the ""free"" versions or unpaid Linux and -- is there a saturation on-premise?

I was beginning to think that somebody was impersonating you. I appreciate that. But no, seriously, on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is we have always talked about how we get into a customer, and our business grows with them. And that almost always that growth happens when we step up at renewal time. And for a long time, we were more focused on doing 1-year deals than doing multi-year deals. And so every year, each of those deals would ratchet up. Well -- and I still think it's the right decision, 2.5 years ago, we decided to focus more on doing multi-year deals, so we could get the customers locked into a set of technologies on which we could then go work to upsell, which we do. But the problem with that is after you've been doing that for 2.5 years, you've drained a lot of the swamp of potential renewal, which means a deal we did making it up last year that had 20% growth, well, that growth rolling through revenue this year is 0. And the deal we did 2 years ago that had 20-something percent growth in it is rolling through revenue flat this year. And we just don't have as many renewals because these are the people we couldn't get in 3-year deals in the last 2 years that are up now. And so yes, we see good growth, and we talked about, since that one competitive loss, we still see solid upsell and cross-sell in our renewals when they come up. But the renewal is typically the precipitating event to do the upsell and cross-sell. And while certainly that's not always the case, we have people in multi-year deals. We have multiple other deals with them. But the renewal is that precipitating event, and we just -- it's a lot lower, which if you actually ask our sales teams the amount of net new growth that they have to get this year, they're seeing growth numbers 30%, 40%, 50% depending on the region, which given -- I don't want to say renewals are automatic. Obviously, we have a very high renewal rate. That amount of new business that they're seeing is like dramatically higher in terms of the new business that they have to go get and are going and getting than you're seeing in our revenue or even our bookings numbers because of just the kind of the relatively lower renewal rate. So that's why you hear us talking about. It's not that we're ""milking"" the renewal. It's just we don't have the precipitating events as often as we typically do. And again, that starts to come back next year because we get into the steady state of the -- from 3 years ago, those renewals coming back around. I don't think there's a change in focus on what we're doing. It's just the sheer math of how much business we have that we can cross sell and upsell on."

And if you think about most of the customer engagements that we have, even looking at the CCSP program, our online program, we're harvesting those opportunities for future growth opportunities. So it starts with when a customer's already using RHEL, from a technology perspective, it's a whole lot easier for conversations since they're already using our OS to then start using OpenShift, especially if they're going to start containerizing their applications. So it really is more of a technology discussion and why it makes sense. So it's not just the fact that we're going back to the same customers, but it really is, as Jim said, a business event that makes it much easier for them to leverage the newer technology."

In the second quarter, we continued to see demand from our customers around the globe as they focus on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives. We enable our customers to succeed on these initiatives with our innovative solutions, award-winning support and global services. Our focus on customers helped us drive strong results in the second quarter where we delivered double-digit growth in a number of our key financial metrics. Let me highlight a few of those for the quarter.
Our total backlog, driven by strong bookings, grew 20% year-over-year. Our major geographic regions each grew bookings at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenues grew more than 30% year-over-year. And our services revenue, led by demand for OpenShift and Ansible consulting and training, grew 19% year-over-year in constant currency.
Now let me give you some business metrics and highlights that demonstrate our continued traction with our customers and partners. Looking at our deals over $1 million this quarter, we closed a total of 73 deals over $1 million, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Within these deals, 11 were greater than $5 million, which is a record in a Q2 for us, and 1 deal was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was strong in this cohort, over 76% of the top deals greater than $1 million including 1 or more components of our Application Development-related and emerging technologies offerings. One of the deals over $5 million was the largest services deal we have ever closed in a quarter. This deal is with a global bank that is digitally transforming their payments business based on our integration middleware. Other top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were financial services and the government sector.
Looking at our top deals. 24 out of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal did so at an aggregate value of more than 100% of their previous value. The one deal that did not renew is a rare competitive loss to a legacy on-premise provider based on pricing. We're actively pursuing future business with this customer as they evaluate additional technologies such as adopting OpenShift as a multi-cloud platform for the digital transformation of their business. Removing the one lost deal and using the next largest deal that did renew, the adjusted top 25 deals for the quarter would have renewed at an aggregate value of approximately 115% of their previous value.
Looking more broadly across our customer base at 2 of our fastest growing technologies, OpenShift and Ansible, let me provide you with some recent achievements that demonstrate the momentum we're seeing with our customers and partners. Last week, we announced a multi-partner relationship with Hortonworks and IBM Cloud Private to bring their big data and analytics products onto OpenShift. This is designed to enable customers to develop and run data-intensive applications on OpenShift, bringing them the power of hybrid cloud. Our Ansible technology reached approximately 2 million managed nodes at the end of Q2, essentially doubling the number of managed nodes since Q4 of last year. Overall, both of these technologies added nearly 100 new customers each since Q1, and we continue to grow the median revenue per customer.
In summary, we continue to drive significant adoption of our hybrid cloud technologies even as we worked through the headwinds in middleware and our renewal base that we view and have previously disclosed -- or discussed. We remain confident in our long-term competitive position and our proven ability to become increasingly strategic with our customers as evidenced by our growth over the past several quarters with large customer engagements and momentum with our partners.
I want to thank Red Hat associates for their tireless efforts in serving our customers. From building innovative solutions to delivering and supporting these technologies, we continue to stay focused on the success of our customers and delivering value every day.
With that, let me turn the call over to Eric."

Let me also recognize and thank our global associates for their continued commitment to helping our customers succeed. Red Hat's ability to deliver business value has been a key driver to building a multi-billion-dollar business, and the strength of our strategic customer relationships is one of the reasons we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Our performance this quarter was driven by the demand for our hybrid cloud technologies, which enabled us to deliver results that were in line with our guidance.
As a result of our performance to date and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth in constant currency at 16% to 17%, along with our full year non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow. However, in U.S. dollars, we are lowering the full year revenue range by approximately $15 million to account solely for the change in FX rates, as the trend of weaker rates against the dollar for many of the major foreign currencies has continued to decline in recent months.
For instance, Q2 total revenue would have been nearly $3 million higher using the FX rates from my June guidance. As such, for this call, I will discuss our results in both USD and constant currency to provide a full view of the impacts of foreign currency on our results. A more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our -- for our non-GAAP measures to GAAP is included in our earnings press release.
I will now review our Q2 performance and business metrics before finishing with our outlook for Q3 and the rest of FY '19. In the second quarter, we delivered $823 million of total revenue, which was in line with guidance and represented growth of 14% in both USD and constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, this result of USD included a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $3 million from the rates used for guidance in June.
Subscription revenue, which is mainly renewable, made up 88% of total revenue in Q2 and grew 13% in USD or 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $527 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. This result was impacted by the lower available renewal base, which is largely RHEL and the lower renewal value that Jim discussed in our top 25 renewals metric. Year-to-date, our infrastructure-related offerings are up 11% in USD and 10% in constant currency.
Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $196 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency. Within this portfolio, we continue to drive rapid growth in our emerging technologies, particularly in Ansible and OpenShift. As we discussed in the past, this growth has become somewhat offset by the moderation we are experiencing in our middleware offerings. We continue to believe that as customers shift their workloads to container environments, our middleware results and subscription revenue will benefit in the long run. Overall, Application Development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 24% of total revenue, up 300 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
Lastly, our services revenue of $100 million grew 17% year-over-year in USD or 19% in constant currency. The strong growth of our services business was driven by demand for training and consulting projects for our Ansible and OpenShift offerings. As I have mentioned before, our services business is both a leading and lagging indicator for the demand around our emerging products. We have seen that customers who buy both services and subscriptions tend to have higher retention, which can lead to future opportunities and additional technology sales.
Before we move to our non-GAAP operating income results, as a reminder, our non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Non-GAAP EPS adjusts for all these items as well as noncash interest expense related to the debt discount.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 operating income of $197 million grew 3% year-over-year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. This quarterly result was 90 basis points higher than my June guidance and reflects some repositioning of hiring and marketing programs to the second half of the fiscal year. Net other income was $4 million and in line with guidance.
Shifting to taxes and EPS, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter, which includes discrete tax benefits and the impact from certain nondeductible share-based compensation expense. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, up 10% year-over-year and above my guidance as a result of the higher non-GAAP operating margin.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.4 billion, an increase of $341 million, representing growth of 17% in USD or 19% in constant currency over the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $250 million or 1.7 million shares under our new share repurchase authorization, which has a remaining balance of approximately $750 million. In addition, we had approximately $245 million of total cash outflows related to repayment of convertible notes.
Moving to operating cash flow. With the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-15: Statement of Cash Flows, which requires us to classify the portion of the repayment of convertible notes attributable to debt discount as an operating cash flow as opposed to financing cash outflow. In an effort to appropriately reflect the cash generated from the operations of the business and for comparability of prior periods, we will provide both a GAAP and non-GAAP operating cash flow metric.
Our GAAP operating cash flow, inclusive of the $32 million of repayments for the convertible notes attributable to the debt discount, was $133 million, down 7% year-over-year. The non-GAAP operating cash flow was $165 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year.
Our FX-adjusted DSO was 61 days, up 5 days from Q2 of last year, driven by business linearity. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was $884 million, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, the rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters.
Now I will discuss our total backlog for Q2, which includes billed contracts from the balance sheet, the new ASC 606 performance obligation disclosures, and our backlog for time and materials service bookings. Total backlog was up 20% year-over-year in Q2 for an estimated balance of $3.3 billion in USD. Our backlog in the quarter was the result of our bookings performance with all of our regions at double-digit growth year-over-year. As for the regional mix in the second quarter, 54% of our bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. The second quarter route-to-market mix was 77% from the channel and 23% from our direct sales force compared to second quarter prior year's split of 79% and 21%.
Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 22 months, up nearly 1 month from Q2 last year. We attribute this to some customers choosing to extend their commitment to Red Hat with a longer-term strategic partnership.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally continued to weaken against the dollar year-over-year.
I will begin with our full year guidance, which assumes an incremental FX headwind to revenue of $15 million as compared to our prior guidance. As a result, we are adjusting our total revenue guidance in USD to $3.360 billion to $3.395 billion or a year-over-year growth range of 15% to 16% in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we are reaffirming the year-over-year growth range of 16% to 17%.
From a profitability perspective, we are reconfirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, which includes the necessary investments to drive future growth. We are planning an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for FY '19 prior to discrete items and our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $3.45 to $3.49 per share. This assumes approximately $4 million per quarter for net other income and approximately 184 million diluted shares, which is lower due to share repurchases.
Due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of any future convertible note settlements, our guidance will now be on the non-GAAP operating cash flow for FY '19. Excluding the repayments of convertible notes that are attributable to the debt discount, our outlook remains unchanged for the full year. Non-GAAP operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of approximately $1.035 billion to $1.045 billion, which includes an incremental $10 million in tax payments.
For Q3, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $848 million to $856 million, which is up approximately 13% to 14% in USD and 15% to 16% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 with a 22.5% tax rate prior to discrete items. This assumes approximately $4 million in Q3 for net other income and 184 million diluted shares. We will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections.
Looking forward, we remain excited that Red Hat is increasingly viewed as a top strategic IT partner to the world's leading companies as they execute on their digital transformation and hybrid cloud initiatives, and we remain committed to our customers' success. David, at this point, please open up the call for questions."

So there's actually a couple of components that are impacting the RHEL revenue growth.

The other thing is, as Jim had mentioned, we did have this larger competitive loss within the quarter, which impacted -- which did have an impact, as well as we also had a project descope from the army that impacted the growth in RHEL as well. So we had a couple of components other than just the lower renewal base. In terms of right now the way that we are looking at the bookings and the momentum we've seen in the field and the pipeline, we do believe that we've bottomed out in terms of the RHEL growth slowing down. And it's our expectation from here through the second half of the year and into next year that we will see a reacceleration of the growth rate."

I think a lot of our new, smaller customers are coming in via cloud. We have some really nice growth there. It's still growing at more than twice the growth rate of the company. So yes -- and a lot of that, we believe, is new business. The core business, customers are continuing to renew, we give you those numbers. The odd part, again, just to remind everyone, we started about 2.5 years ago focusing on trying to do multi-year deals to try to basically kind of get our customers kind of into multi-year engagements, so our sales force could focus on net new. Well, obviously, 3 years -- 2.5 years into that, yes, we've done our best to get people in 3-year deals. So our renewal base is quite small relative to where it's been in the past. And it's at renewal when we typically take up the size of those relationships. So fewer renewals means less takeup in these last couple of quarters. But again, I mean we're seeing it from both. We still see a lot of growth with our existing customers. And as we talked about in the past, customers who are adopting cloud tend to grow their RHEL footprints faster than those who aren't."

So there was a little bit of cost management as we went through the quarter. Essentially, as you think about the guide for the rest of the year, I expect the margin essentially to be flat as we go into Q3. And then it will pop up into Q4 because some of the marketing spend that we have will be actually done in Q3 versus Q4. So we're going to continue to actively manage the cost side. But at the same time too, I just want to emphasize that we are continuing to be very, very mindful about making the appropriate investments into our more strategic areas. So a lot of those investments come, as we get efficiencies and productivities, in other spaces and -- within the company.

So -- and then obviously, this quarter, as we looked at the bookings and the billings, the renewal base continued to be a bit of a headwind as well as just reemphasizing both this project descope that was out of our control that was specific to the army as well as this one loss -- this one competitive loss. They did also both have a fair amount of content of RHEL. So all of these impacted us in the current quarter, which, again, gives us confidence that, as we look at the pipeline, as we look at -- we go into second half, we do see a reacceleration of the growth."

I mean, Kash, just a little bit on PaaS, and what I would also say, I mean, obviously, the vast majority of our revenue is baked when we come into a quarter. So coming out of Q1, where we were light on where we wanted to be on billings and backlog, kind of rolled through this -- obviously, we had a lot stronger quarter this quarter in growth there. And so we have some better visibility looking forward into RHEL. And so we do think this is kind of the bottom there. Related to PaaS, we're seeing great traction. I mean, we have over 100 new customers for OpenShift. Not only is it customers. It's also partners. And so unlike some other software companies that will pay tens of millions of dollars to enable SIs, we focus on bottom-up demand generation. And so we've gotten really good bottom-up support for OpenShift. And now the large global system integrators are all building practices around OpenShift, and I think that also leads to incremental traction. I think the Microsoft deal, which we announced -- the relationship that we announced back at Summit, is -- has raised awareness and has helped as well. So I was in Europe last week, and I think out of the maybe 30 or so customer meetings I had, 20 something of them were about OpenShift in particular. It really is a topic that people want to understand and figure out how to do in containers. I will say just editorial comment. I also think one of the things that has slowed RHEL growth a bit is customers want to talk about containers, and we need to continue to talk about RHEL is part of that portfolio. And I do think shiny object syndrome gets us all, me included, where we're talking about OpenShift and Ansible because there is so much traction around them. But overall, I've -- hard to find a customer that's not looking at or starting to use OpenShift in some way, which is great to see."

I do think we'll see it reaccelerate through this year. Exactly where that ends up, hard to exactly say. As we get into next year, we have a much larger renewal base. And since OpenShift's continuing its momentum, which I hope it does, I would say it can easily accelerate quite a bit. But we are running into a little bit of a sales capacity issue. And so the better OpenShift does and the more time we're spending on that, the less time we're selling RHEL. So the demand's clearly there. The market's clearly there. And so given the size of the renewal base, I think it'll expand more than that, but I want to be a little bit guarded just as people are -- there's just so much momentum around OpenShift right now that it does kind of eat into selling time on RHEL. So clearly, the -- if you look at the overall trends on the move of workloads from Windows to Linux and the overall growth of workloads, certainly feel like it should reaccelerate above well above 10% and back into the teens. But again, our other products can, at times, kind of start to push that out a little bit, which is I think part of the dynamic that we've seen with the strength at OpenShift affecting RHEL a bit. Now that's a long answer, but we feel really good about the macro trends around Linux. And it's just about ability of us to have the bandwidth to pick it all up."

That's the differentiator that telcos have. So we have a significant amount of engineering effort working with the telcos on OpenShift as well. The timing of that, again, those deals continue to grow. We had 14 deals with OpenStack over $1 million, which is up nicely from last year. Not all of those are in telco, though we did have some sizable telco wins. And we have, I think, 4 significant NFV wins with telcos in the quarter.

So certainly, if we have a customer that comes in the second half of this year where they have something that's going to renew next year, but if they come to us and say, gee, we'd like to do a bigger engagement and we like to infuse some OpenShift or OpenStack, et cetera, we absolutely will do that deal. And that will throw some of this off, and there's a fair amount of that as it happens. Certainly, the one thing we're not going to do is pull in deals ourselves. But if a customer has a business need and they want to expand their scope with us, we absolutely will entertain those.

But some of the time on that deal is spent on the renewal of the components around it, where the reason we originally started 2.5 years ago trying to get people in these 3-year deals is it frees up more time to go sell net new. Now the net new may not be as efficient to sell and it may be shorter like 1-year deals, but it does -- it kind of creates more kind of clarity and focus in our go-to-market organization. So hard to say which of those actually kind of weighs out in terms of the emerging. I would say on [ balance perhaps ] the team, they're going to say attach and growing cross-sell, upsell around the renewal is the more efficient way to see that grow. But again, it is more sales time spent on that renewal as well than on the new business. So there might be a little bit of an impact there in terms of accelerating the other associated with it.

And the one that we lost, we did an even bigger middleware deal with after. When we've lost people in the past, we have typically won them back. It sounds logical to say, ""Oh, I can get a cheaper price for my Linux.""  But what production customers find is they don't get that quality of software and certainly not support that they get from us. And so honestly, I don't mind losing one every now and then. If we win them all, then we're probably underpricing. And we have a really good track record of winning them back after they've had a chance to experience the other. And so given that and how rare the losses are and how often the losses have come back and even become reference customers for us, we always want to take competitors seriously. But in terms of over looking at this one deal, I wouldn't kind of overly focus on that relative to our long-term history of competing with others. In terms of middleware, I think you hit on a good point. In the same way that we did multi-year deals on RHEL, a lot of those deals and stand-alone JBoss deals were multi-year deals 3 years ago as well.

But you've really done it, and you dominate the paid Linux market. And more recently, you moved aggressively into new growth markets, and you've currently become very relative in those markets. You've been leading them. But -- and this is to ask in a respectful manner. It's really usually not a good sign when a growth business starts to talk about the effects of renewal cycles, the reasons of moderating growth. And I'm just -- I think a lot of us are just wondering, is there something else happening here in the Linux business? And I don't know. I don't know what it could be. Like there's -- people have feared at times that people are going to start in the public cloud, start to use sort of the ""free"" versions or unpaid Linux and -- is there a saturation on-premise? Is there anything else happening here? Or is it really -- or is it just sort of a renewal cycle?"

I was beginning to think that somebody was impersonating you. I appreciate that. But no, seriously, on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is we have always talked about how",512,"Yes. John, well, first off, thanks for the compliments. I was beginning to think that somebody was impersonating you. I appreciate that. But no, seriously, on the renewal cycle, the reason you're hearing us talk about it is we have always talked about how we get into a customer, and our business grows with them. And that almost always that growth happens when we step up at renewal time. And for a long time, we were more focused on doing 1-year deals than doing multi-year deals. And so every year, each of those deals would ratchet up. Well -- and I still think it's the right decision, 2.5 years ago, we decided to focus more on doing multi-year deals, so we could get the customers locked into a set of technologies on which we could then go work to upsell, which we do. But the problem with that is after you've been doing that for 2.5 years, you've drained a lot of the swamp of potential renewal, which means a deal we did making it up last year that had 20% growth, well, that growth rolling through revenue this year is 0. And the deal we did 2 years ago that had 20-something percent growth in it is rolling through revenue flat this year. And we just don't have as many renewals because these are the people we couldn't get in 3-year deals in the last 2 years that are up now. And so yes, we see good growth, and we talked about, since that one competitive loss, we still see solid upsell and cross-sell in our renewals when they come up. But the renewal is typically the precipitating event to do the upsell and cross-sell. And while certainly that's not always the case, we have people in multi-year deals. We have multiple other deals with them. But the renewal is that precipitating event, and we just -- it's a lot lower, which if you actually ask our sales teams the amount of net new growth that they have to get this year, they're seeing growth numbers 30%, 40%, 50% depending on the region, which given -- I don't want to say renewals are automatic. Obviously, we have a very high renewal rate. That amount of new business that they're seeing is like dramatically higher in terms of the new business that they have to go get and are going and getting than you're seeing in our revenue or even our bookings numbers because of just the kind of the relatively lower renewal rate. So that's why you hear us talking about. It's not that we're ""milking"" the renewal. It's just we don't have the precipitating events as often as we typically do. And again, that starts to come back next year because we get into the steady state of the -- from 3 years ago, those renewals coming back around. I don't think there's a change in focus on what we're doing. It's just the sheer math of how much business we have that we can cross sell and upsell on."

I mean, John, it's Eric. I think just in addition to what Jim said, I mean, if you think about it, when we're out with customers, it's a natural progression, if they're already using RHEL, to then start to talk about using OpenShift, using OpenStack, et cetera, because that technology shift makes it a whole lot easier. So as Jim said, we're not giving -- we don't want to give the impression that we have a certain set of customers that we're just relying on those renewals. We've got thousands of customers, right? And if you think about most of the customer engagements that we have, even looking at the CCSP program, our online program, we're harvesting those opportunities for future growth opportunities. So it starts with when a customer's already using RHEL, from a technology perspective, it's a whole lot easier for conversations since they're already using our OS to then start using OpenShift, especially if they're going to start containerizing their applications. So it really is more of a technology discussion and why it makes sense. So it's not just the fact that we're going back to the same customers, but it really is, as Jim said, a business event that makes it much easier for them to leverage the newer technology."

If anything, we continue to gain share from our on-premise competitors. And again, just looking cloud for cloud and our relative RHEL growth rates in those clouds versus their overall growth rates, I don't think we're losing share to whether it's Amazon Linux or any of the other Linuxes out there. So I don't see a place where we are losing share. Again, a lot of this, you're getting the math of the fact that many of our customers are in 3-year engagements that aren't growing. So you're getting this weighted average thing, and we're in the year before the renewals restart. So I don't know. I don't see us losing share at all. If anything, I see us gaining share. And again, maintaining share on public cloud as public cloud grows is also taking share because that's vast majority Linux and -- versus on-premise where nearly half the workloads are Windows. So overall, I feel very, very good about where we stand with Linux and how we're growing. What's the second part of that?"

To be clear, CoreOS is different than Ansible in the sense that Ansible was an additional product that has done extremely well for us. CoreOS is a set of features in a container platform that we are integrating into OpenShift. The CoreOS team focused on ease of use from the user's perspective. We bring incredible content associated with RHEL in the RHEL ecosystem and how we life cycle. Those, together, it's a phenomenal marriage. We've started to bring some of those technologies in into OpenShift in the various dot releases. And certainly, as we get into Openshift 4, you'll see kind of, let's say, basically the entirety of their core feature set integrated in. And we're really excited about it. I think that's one of the reasons that we're seeing so much traction with OpenShift today."
