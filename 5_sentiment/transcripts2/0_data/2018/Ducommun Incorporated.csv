And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call.

And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call. I'll be providing an overview of recent developments, after which Doug Groves, will review our financial results in detail. So just completed a very important year for Ducommun, one of which related the foundation for future growth with several initiatives designed to strengthen our core capabilities. As you know, we purchased light in emerging system with LDS last September, bolstering our electronics business proprietary technology suitable for numerous aerospace and defense applications. I'm pleased to announced that you know the LDS is fully integrated into the company that as leaders [indiscernible] Dave [indiscernible] has taken on additional responsibility at Ducommun to help drive the growth of our electronic segment. Dave is off to a great start of the company as the key part of my leadership plan.
We also announced last quarter, the company will begin implementing a multistage structuring program to cut cost, improve operating efficiency and ultimately, increase our asset utilization, particularly with regards to our structure's operation, while we need a good amount of improvement.
While the structures margins were predictably low due to our investment in next-generation programs and the expansion of our Parsons Facility, this was a big focus for the Q4 restructuring activities. Therefore as expected, we began by taking $8.8 million of restructuring charges in the Q4, reflecting actions taken across the entire company, which Doug will review shortly. Structures segment is mentioned was 65% of this cost or $5.8 million where significant work needs to be done. The charges in total encompass [ 7 ] lease termination and fixed asset impairments, meant to start the process of consolidating function and eliminating redundancies across the organization. Reduce the number of Vice Presidents in the company and our operation from 12 to 6, took out one entire layer of management of large organization and consolidated our business unit from 6 to 3. Due to these changes, there were difficult to make, we're much more nimble, transparent and close to the customer.
We've also closed some small facilities, written off excess machinery and equipment and continuing the process of the exiting fully performing programs such as certain regional and business jet platforms and a few helicopter programs, as we discussed in the past. Our overall adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 5%, excluding restructuring expenses and certain one-time inventory purchases accounting adjustments related to the LDS acquisition. This is versus 5.2% in Q3 and 6.4% last year. While we're working out many of the changes and headwinds from 2017, I fully expect and you should to, better margins in 2018. We remain on track to complete the company's restructuring program with 2018 and realize approximately $14 million in annual savings, starting next year. And we are driving and committed to be much better, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industries. Another positive development for invested in the company as we head into the year with significant uptake in our backlog to a record $726 million. This backlog cuts across both our military and commercial segments and is a great sign for the year ahead.
So I'm feeling very good about 2018. As you work hard, take steps, position the company for faster growth, higher margins and stronger customer relationships, all leveraging our proprietary processes, technology and highly-skilled staff. 
Now let me to provide some color on our end-use markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $63.8 million, down slightly from last year primarily due to some timing of certain deliveries. While greater rack shipments were lower, year-over-year in Q4 as structural components for military helicopters. We saw a strong growth in the missile defense platform, particularly for Raytheon's Paveway laser-guided systems. This became one of our top defense related programs for last year. For 2017 as a whole, to comments on military and space revenue was just under $260 million, up 13% from 2016 $229 million. Our backlog again a great story grew as well, ending 2017 at $277 million versus $256 million beginning at the year. With most of the increase due to lower's across our innovative defense electronic applications. Given this level of contract activity, feel confident that Ducommun will again mark solid performance across military and space platforms this year as well. This is due to the key programs we are on. The ongoing need for technology upgrades with our customers and, of course, potential for increased defense spending. With our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales were $64.1 million, up just slightly from the last year, again reflecting shipment timing. Notably, we saw a nice gain in revenue for a large fixed-rate aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. Revenues on this platform were up 28% in 2017 and now will represent almost 40% of our commercial aerospace business. We also saw her business on Airbus platforms grow almost 30% in 2017 as we continue to win content with this important end-new customer. It's worth noting as well as previously discussed to comment as exited fully performing regional and business jet platforms as well as exiting a couple of the helicopter programs, which I mentioned. We ended 2017 with record commercial aerospace backlog of $418 million, up [ $60 million ] from where we were at the start of the year. This really shows momentum we are building across the commercial landscape as well as benefiting from increased build rates of the large airframe portion of our business. In addition, while we made some decisions to exit certain unattractive platforms, the regional business jet space was still bullish on certain opportunities. For example, we're excited about our wins with Gulfstream and look forward to the ramp up in 2018 of the G500 and G600 series, a new series of large cabin will long-range business jets. Ducommun is a soulful supplier of titanium power inlet duct and the cooler ducts for these aircraft, which will seizable supply out of our Parsons Facility. Along with the attractive wins such as this, where supplying value-added solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, we also see plenty of room for growth within the jet engine market along with our core narrow-body programs. We're making good progress on many new product introductions. We've discussed in the past and expect most of them to be in production the first half of this year. These dev programs have been somewhat dragged on margins, but we're now seeing marketplace success and given the completion of our Parsons expansion in this spring, which will result in slow but steady improvements to our operating leverage along with ongoing ramp up of new platforms.
Such programs that may not track including Boeing 737 MAX, our largest and we're excited about the additional business, our state-of-the-art titanium applications can win.
I've seen a lot of progress in Q4 from the team, especially in support of all the organizational changes. And now position the company well for higher growth, margin expansion and improved return for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016.

Revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016. This performance reflects $0.9 million of higher sales with the company's commercial aerospace customers and slight gains within our industrial end-use markets offset by $1.3 million of lower revenue across our military and space markets due to shipment timing. Ducommun's backlog rose to $726 million at the end of this quarter, it's highest level ever, again, highlighting the key programs we serve as well as a critical components in models we provide to aerospace OEMs. Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 18.1% in the fourth quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. This decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and is part of our restructuring activities, $0.5 million inventory write-downs related to an exited commercial helicopter program. SG&A was $20.1 million in the fourth quarter versus $18.6 million in 2016 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation of benefit costs and higher professional service fees. The company reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $2.7 million or negative 1.9% of revenue versus operating income of $9 million or 6.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily due to the restructuring charges that were $8.7 million greater within the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher amortization of intangible assets related to the LDS acquisition. As Steve mentioned, we implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in November, which for the quarter included $5.8 million of charges within our structural segments; with $1.2 million with our electronic segment; and $1.8 million at the corporate level. These charges represent the initial stage of our restructuring plan which encompass certain headcount reductions, facility consolidations and fixed asset impairments. We will take further measures in 2018 to illuminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses and right sized the company, and we anticipate approximately $1 million in charges to be booked in the first quarter of 2018, primarily within the structures business and a total of approximately $10 million this year and restructuring charges. As previous noted, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays typically for severance and facility consolidation and noncash items, including the write-off of machinery and equipment. For the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as $1.1 million of expense tied to the LDS purchase accounting adjustments in cost to goods sold, Ducommun's adjusted operating margin was 5%. Interest expense was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $2.0 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of LDS. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. On our adjusted basis, net income was $4.6 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share on adjusted basis in 2016. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects $17.5 million of lower tax expense due to congress enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2018, which requires the company remeasure it preferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The impact from this taxes legislation was a $13 million benefit, which was partially offset by the restructuring charges, I just mentioned, as well as slightly higher SG&A expenses versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Note that the prior year period did include a $1.2 million net working capital adjustment for which there was no tax-related benefits, and a $0.8 million net of tax adjustment related to the finalization of the defense. Going forward, our expected tax rate will be approximately 18% to 19% before ending restructuring charges. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 15.1% or 10.6% of revenue for the comparable period to 2016. Now let me turn to the segment results. Our structural system segment posted revenue of $65.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $60.8 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on large single aisle platforms. Structural systems posted an operating loss for the quarter of $2.7 million or negative 4.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to restructuring charge of $5.8 million, as I previously mentioned, and unfavorable product mix. Excluding the restructuring charges structures' adjusted operating margin was 4.8% for the 2017 fourth quarter. As Steve discussed, we're evaluating and implementing a series of measures to enhance manifesting efficiencies and improve asset utilization across our structures' business, which we anticipate, will result in higher margins beginning later this year and into 2019. Margins should also benefit with the ramp up of the new programs that are Parsons complex and the associated increase offering leverage. Turning to the electronic segment, our electronics segment posted revenue of $77.2 million of fourth quarter versus $81.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $3.2 million of lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $1.5 million decrease in revenue within our military and space end-use markets, all due to shipment timing. Electronic systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.8 million or 8.8% of revenue versus $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue in the prior year period. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter included a $1.2 million restructuring charge and $1.1 million of higher cost of goods sold tied to revaluing inventory from the LDS acquisition last year, excluding the restructuring charges and higher cost of goods sold, electronics operating margin was 11.7% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A for the fourth quarter, was $6.9 million or 4.8% of total company revenue compared to $3.4 million or 2.4% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.8 million, as I mentioned, and higher compensation and benefit cost and higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $8.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $35.4 million for the full year, which was down from $43.3 million in 2016 due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts payable. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018 Habs in any acquisitions. In terms of CapEx, we spent $4 million in the fourth quarter which $2.6 million was related to the Parsons facility expansion. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, which is much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we largely completed the investment related to our Parsons' facility expansion.
Overall, we ended the year well positioned for further growth and higher margins due to our restructuring initiatives, the expansion of the new development programs and the steps being taken to leverage our proprietary processes, technology and titanium expertise on these new platforms. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call. I'll begin providing an overview of recent developments, after which, Doug Groves, will review our financial results in detail. So we just completed a very important year for Ducommun, one of which will lay the foundation for future growth through several initiatives designed to strengthen our core capabilities. 
As you know, we purchased Lightning Diversion Systems or LDS last September, bolstering our electronics business proprietary technology suitable for numerous aerospace and defense applications. 
I'm pleased to announced that -- you know the LDS has been fully integrated into the company, and that its leader, Dave Wilmot has taken additional responsibility here at Ducommun to help drive the growth of our electronic segment. Dave is off to a great start in the company as a key part of my leadership team.
We also announced last quarter, the company will begin implementing a multi-stage structuring program to cut costs, improve operating efficiency and ultimately, increase our asset utilization, particularly with regards to our structure's operation, where we need a good amount of improvement.
While the structures margins are predictably low due to our investment in next-generation programs and the expansion of our Parsons facility, this was a big focus for the Q4 restructuring activities. Therefore, as expected, we began by taking $8.8 million of restructuring charges in the Q4, reflecting actions taken across the entire company, which Doug will review shortly. 
The Structural segment, as mentioned, was 65% of this cost or $5.8 million, where significant work needs to be done. The charges in total encompass severance, lease termination and fixed asset impairments meant to start the process of consolidating functions and eliminating redundancies across the organization. 
We reduced the number of Vice Presidents in the company in our operations from 12 to 6, took out one entire layer of management to flatten the organization and consolidated our business units from 6 to 3. Due to these changes that were difficult to make, we are much more nimble, transparent and close to the customer.
We have also closed some small facilities, written off excess machinery and equipment and continuing the process of exiting fully performing programs such as certain regional and business jet platforms and a few helicopter programs, as we discussed in the past. Our overall adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 5%, excluding restructuring expenses and certain one-time inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to the LDS acquisition. This is versus 5.2% in Q3 and 6.4% last year. 
While we are working out many of the changes and headwinds from 2017, I fully expect, and you should, too, better margins in 2018. We remain on track to complete the company's restructuring program with 2018 and realize approximately $14 million in annual savings, starting next year. And we are driving and committed to be a much better, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industries. 
Another positive development for our investors in the company as we enter the year with a significant uptake in our backlog to a record $726 million. This backlog cuts across both our military and commercial segments and is a great sign for the year ahead.
So I'm feeling very good about 2018. As we work hard, take steps and position the company for faster growth, higher margins and stronger customer relationships, all leveraging our proprietary processes, technology and highly-skilled staff. Now let me provide some color on our end-use markets, products and programs. 
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $63.8 million, down slightly from last year, primarily due to some timing of certain deliveries. While greater rack shipments were lower year-over-year in Q4 as our structural components for military helicopters, we saw a strong growth in the missile defense platform, particularly for Raytheon's Paveway laser-guided systems. This became one of our top defense-related programs for last year. For 2017 as a whole, to comment on military and space revenue, it was just under $260 million, up 13% from 2016 $229 million. Our backlog, again a great story, grew as well, ending 2017 at $277 million versus $256 million beginning of the year, with most of the increase due to awards across our innovative defense and electronic applications. 
Given this level of contract activity, I feel confident that Ducommun will again mark solid performance across military and space platforms this year as well. This is due to the key programs we're on, the ongoing need for technology upgrades with our customers and, of course, the potential for increased defense spending. With our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales were $64.1 million, up just slightly from-- last year, again reflecting shipment timing. Notably, we saw a nice gain in revenue for a large fixed [indiscernible] aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. 
Revenues on this platforms were up 28% in 2017 and now represent almost 40% of our commercial aerospace business. We also saw our business on Airbus platforms grow almost 30% in 2017 as we continue to win content with this important end-new customer. It's worth noting as well, as previously discussed, to comment as exited fully performing regional and business jet platforms as well as exiting a couple of the helicopter programs, which I've mentioned. 
We ended 2017 with record commercial aerospace backlog of $418 million, up $60 million from where we were at the start of the year. This clearly shows the momentum we're building across the commercial landscape as well as benefit from increased build rates with the large airframe portion of our business. 
In addition, while we made some decisions to exit certain unattractive platforms, the regional business jet space was still bullish on certain opportunities. For example, we're excited about our wins with Gulfstream and look forward to the ramp-up in 2018 of the G500 and G600 series, a new family of large-cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun is a sole source supplier of titanium auxillary power inlet duct and the cooler ducts for these aircrafts, which we'll supply out of our Parsons facility. 
Along with attractive wins such as this, where we're supplying value-added solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, we also see plenty of room for growth within the jet engine market along with our core narrow-body programs. We're making good progress on many new product introductions we've discussed in the past and expect most of them to be in production the first half of this year. 
These development programs have been somewhat of a drag on margins but are now seeing marketplace success. And given the completion of our Parsons expansion this spring, which will result in slow but steady improvements to our operating leverage along with ongoing ramp-up of new platforms.
Such programs remain on track, including Boeing 737 MAX, our largest. And we're excited about the additional business our state-of-the-art titanium applications can win.
I seen a lot of progress in Q4 from the team, especially in support of all the organizational changes, and now position the company well for higher growth, margin expansion and improved return for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.1% in the fourth quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. This decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and is part of our restructuring activities, $0.5 million in inventory write-offs related to an exited commercial helicopter program. SG&A was $20.1 million in the fourth quarter versus $18.6 million in 2016, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and higher professional service fees. 
The company reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $2.7 million or negative 1.9% of revenue versus operating income of $9 million or 6.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily due to the restructuring charges that were $8.7 million greater than in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher amortization of intangible assets related to the LDS acquisition. As Steve mentioned, we implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in November, which, for the quarter, included $5.8 million of charges within our Structural Systems segments, $1.2 million with our Electronic Systems segment, and $1.8 million at the corporate level. These charges represent the initial stage of our restructuring plan, which encompass certain headcount reductions, facility consolidations and fixed asset impairments. We will take further measures in 2018 to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses and rightsize the company. And we anticipate approximately $1 million in charges to be booked in the first quarter of 2018, primarily within the structures business and a total of approximately $10 million this year in restructuring charges. 
As previously noted, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation and noncash items, including the write-off of machinery and equipment. 
For the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as $1.1 million of expense tied to the LDS purchase accounting adjustments in cost to goods sold, Ducommun's adjusted operating margin was 5%. Interest expense was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $2.0 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of LDS. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $4.6 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share on adjusted basis in 2016. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects $17.5 million of lower tax expense due to congress enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 201&, which required the company to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The impact from this tax legislation was a $13 million benefit, which was partially offset by the restructuring charges I just mentioned as well as slightly higher SG&A expenses versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Note that the prior year period did include a $1.2 million net working capital adjustment for which there was no tax-related benefit, and a $0.8 million net of tax adjustment related to the finalization of a divestiture. Going forward, our expected tax rate will be approximately 18% to 19% before ending restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 15.1% or 10.6% of revenue for the comparable period of 2016. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $65.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $60.8 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on large single-aisle platforms. 
Structural Systems posted an operating loss for the quarter of $2.7 million or negative 4.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a restructuring charge of $5.8 million, as I previously mentioned, and unfavorable product mix. Excluding the restructuring charges, Structures' adjusted operating margin was 4.8% for the 2017 fourth quarter. As Steve discussed, we're evaluating and implementing a series of measures to enhance manufacturing efficiency and improve asset utilization across our Structures' business, which we anticipate will result in higher margins beginning later this year and into 2019. Margins should also benefit with the ramp-up of the new programs at our Parsons complex and the associated increase operating leverage. Turning to the electronics segment. Our electronic segment posted revenue of $77.2 million in the fourth quarter versus $81.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $3.2 million of lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $1.5 million decrease in revenue within our military and space end-use markets, all due to shipment timing. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.8 million or 8.8% of revenue versus $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue in the prior year period. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter included a $1.2 million restructuring charge and $1.1 million of higher cost of goods sold tied to revaluing inventory from the LDS acquisition last year. Excluding the restructuring charges and higher cost of goods sold, electronic's operating margin was 11.7% for the 2017 fourth quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter, was $6.9 million or 4.8% of the total company revenue compared to $3.4 million or 2.4% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.8 million, as I mentioned, and higher compensation and benefit cost and higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $8.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $35.4 million for the full year, which was down from $43.3 million in 2016 due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts payable. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018 absent any acquisitions. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4 million in the fourth quarter, which $2.6 million was related to the Parsons facility expansion. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, which is much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we largely completed the investment related to our Parsons' facility expansion.
Overall, we ended the year well-positioned for further growth and higher margins due to our restructuring initiatives, the expansion of the new development programs and the steps being taken to leverage our proprietary processes, technology and titanium expertise on these new platforms. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

So I've just completed my first year last month at Ducommun. And overall, I'm pleased with the progress. I've told the investors that I'd take some time fully assessing the company's strengths and weaknesses and actively work and be decisive in building this business into a much better and higher-performing organization. 
During 2017, we laid our plans to do just that. Pleased to say we're on track with various initiatives to enhance margins and accelerate growth. The first phase of our restructuring plan is complete. We have a great deal more in store for 2018 that will position us to achieve approximately $14 million in annualized cost reductions, starting next year. And we will achieve it. At the same time, we're advancing our innovative technology applications and winning new business with likes of Boeing, Airbus, Gulfstream and Ratheon. With our backlog up over $85 million in just a year and building as we move into 2018, it's clear that Ducommun's people are working hard in bringing value-added solutions to all our customers. 
We'll continue to invest in the business, finish the Parsons expansion this spring and look at opportunistic acquisitions as appropriate. The bottom line is that we'll see numerous ways to improve top line growth, even while focusing on enhancing profitability and long-term asset utilization. 
I want to build Ducommun to an enterprise where all parts of the business are running efficiently and operating at their optimum potential, whether it's electronics or structural applications, on defense or on commercial platforms. 
We're clearly moving in the right direction. And I want to also let everyone know I appreciate the patience of the investment community as you put these necessary changes in place for our long-term success. 
With that, operator, we'll now open the call for questions."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call. I'll begin providing an overview of recent developments, after which, Doug Groves, will review our financial results in detail. So we just completed a very important year for Ducommun, one of which will lay the foundation for future growth through several initiatives designed to strengthen our core capabilities. 
As you know, we purchased Lightning Diversion Systems or LDS last September, bolstering our electronics business proprietary technology suitable for numerous aerospace and defense applications. 
I'm pleased to announced that -- you know the LDS has been fully integrated into the company, and that its leader, Dave Wilmot has taken on additional responsibility here at Ducommun to help drive the growth of our electronic segment. Dave is off to a great start in the company as a key part of my leadership team.
We also announced last quarter, the company will begin implementing a multi-stage restructuring program to cut costs, improve operating efficiency and ultimately, increase our asset utilization, particularly with regards to our structure's operation, where we need a good amount of improvement.
While the structures margins are predictably low due to our investment in next-generation programs and the expansion of our Parsons facility, this was a big focus for the Q4 restructuring activities. Therefore, as expected, we began by taking $8.8 million of restructuring charges in the Q4, reflecting actions taken across the entire company, which Doug will review shortly. 
The Structural segment, as mentioned, was 65% of this cost or $5.8 million, where significant work needs to be done. The charges in total encompass severance, lease termination and fixed asset impairments meant to start the process of consolidating functions and eliminating redundancies across the organization. 
We reduced the number of Vice Presidents in the company in our operations from 12 to 6, took out one entire layer of management to flatten the organization and consolidated our business units from 6 to 3. Due to these changes that were difficult to make, we are much more nimble, transparent and close to the customer.
We have also closed some small facilities, written off excess machinery and equipment and continuing the process of exiting fully performing programs such as certain regional and business jet platforms and a few helicopter programs, as we discussed in the past. Our overall adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 5%, excluding restructuring expenses and certain one-time inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to the LDS acquisition. This is versus 5.2% in Q3 and 6.4% last year. 
While we are working out many of the changes and headwinds from 2017, I fully expect, and you should, too, better margins in 2018. We remain on track to complete the company's restructuring program with 2018 and realize approximately $14 million in annual savings, starting next year. And we are driving and committed to be a much better, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industries. 
Another positive development for our investors in the company as we enter the year with a significant uptake in our backlog to a record $726 million. This backlog cuts across both our military and commercial segments and is a great sign for the year ahead.
So I'm feeling very good about 2018. As we work hard, take steps and position the company for faster growth, higher margins and stronger customer relationships, all leveraging our proprietary processes, technology and highly-skilled staff. Now let me provide some color on our end-use markets, products and programs. 
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $63.8 million, down slightly from last year, primarily due to some timing of certain deliveries. While greater rack shipments were lower year-over-year in Q4 as our structural components for military helicopters, we saw a strong growth in the missile defense platform, particularly for Raytheon's Paveway laser-guided systems. This became one of our top defense-related programs for last year. For 2017 as a whole, to comment on military and space revenue, it was just under $260 million, up 13% from 2016 $229 million. Our backlog, again a great story, grew as well, ending 2017 at $277 million versus $256 million beginning of the year, with most of the increase due to awards across our innovative defense and electronic applications. 
Given this level of contract activity, I feel confident that Ducommun will again mark solid performance across military and space platforms this year as well. This is due to the key programs we're on, the ongoing need for technology upgrades with our customers and, of course, the potential for increased defense spending. With our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales were $64.1 million, up just slightly from-- last year, again reflecting shipment timing. Notably, we saw a nice gain in revenue for a large fixed wing aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. 
Revenues on this platforms were up 28% in 2017 and now represent almost 40% of our commercial aerospace business. We also saw our business on Airbus platforms grow almost 30% in 2017 as we continue to win content with this important and new customer. It's worth noting as well, as previously discussed, to comment as exited fully performing regional and business jet platforms as well as exiting a couple of the helicopter programs, which I've mentioned. 
We ended 2017 with record commercial aerospace backlog of $418 million, up $60 million from where we were at the start of the year. This clearly shows the momentum we're building across the commercial landscape as well as benefit from increased build rates with the large airframe portion of our business. 
In addition, while we made some decisions to exit certain unattractive platforms, the regional business jet space was still bullish on certain opportunities. For example, we're excited about our wins with Gulfstream and look forward to the ramp-up in 2018 of the G500 and G600 series, a new family of large-cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun is a sole source supplier of titanium auxillary power inlet duct and the cooler ducts for these aircrafts, which we'll supply out of our Parsons facility. 
Along with attractive wins such as this, where we're supplying value-added solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, we also see plenty of room for growth within the jet engine market along with our core narrow-body programs. We're making good progress on many new product introductions we've discussed in the past and expect most of them to be in production the first half of this year. 
These development programs have been somewhat of a drag on margins but are now seeing marketplace success. And given the completion of our Parsons expansion this spring, which will result in slow but steady improvements to our operating leverage along with ongoing ramp-up of new platforms.
Such programs remain on track, including Boeing 737 MAX, our largest. And we're excited about the additional business our state-of-the-art titanium applications can win.
I've seen a lot of progress in Q4 from the team, especially in support of all the organizational changes, and now position the company well for higher growth, margin expansion and improved return for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016. This performance reflects $0.9 million of higher sales with the company's commercial aerospace customers",1223,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016. This performance reflects $0.9 million of higher sales with the company's commercial aerospace customers and slight gains within our industrial end-use markets offset by $1.3 million of lower revenue across our military and space markets due to shipment timing. Ducommun's backlog rose to $726 million at the end of this quarter, its highest level ever, again, highlighting the key programs we serve as well as the critical components in modules we provide to aerospace OEMs. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.1% in the fourth quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. This decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and is part of our restructuring activities, $0.5 million in inventory write-offs related to an exited commercial helicopter program. SG&A was $20.1 million in the fourth quarter versus $18.6 million in 2016, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and higher professional service fees. 
The company reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $2.7 million or negative 1.9% of revenue versus operating income of $9 million or 6.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily due to the restructuring charges that were $8.7 million greater than in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher amortization of intangible assets related to the LDS acquisition. As Steve mentioned, we implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in November, which, for the quarter, included $5.8 million of charges within our Structural Systems segments, $1.2 million with our Electronic Systems segment, and $1.8 million at the corporate level. These charges represent the initial stage of our restructuring plan, which encompass certain headcount reductions, facility consolidations and fixed asset impairments. We will take further measures in 2018 to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses and rightsize the company. And we anticipate approximately $1 million in charges to be booked in the first quarter of 2018, primarily within the structures business and a total of approximately $10 million this year in restructuring charges. 
As previously noted, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation and noncash items, including the write-off of machinery and equipment. 
For the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as $1.1 million of expense tied to the LDS purchase accounting adjustments in cost to goods sold, Ducommun's adjusted operating margin was 5%. Interest expense was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $2.0 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of LDS. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $4.6 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share on adjusted basis in 2016. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects $17.5 million of lower tax expense due to congress enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which required the company to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The impact from this tax legislation was a $13 million benefit, which was partially offset by the restructuring charges I just mentioned as well as slightly higher SG&A expenses versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Note that the prior year period did include a $1.2 million net working capital adjustment for which there was no tax-related benefit, and a $0.8 million net of tax adjustment related to the finalization of a divestiture. Going forward, our expected tax rate will be approximately 18% to 19% before ending restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 15.1% or 10.6% of revenue for the comparable period of 2016. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $65.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $60.8 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on large single-aisle platforms. 
Structural Systems posted an operating loss for the quarter of $2.7 million or negative 4.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the restructuring charge of $5.8 million, as I previously mentioned, and unfavorable product mix. Excluding the restructuring charges, Structures' adjusted operating margin was 4.8% for the 2017 fourth quarter. As Steve discussed, we're evaluating and implementing a series of measures to enhance manufacturing efficiency and improve asset utilization across our Structures' business, which we anticipate will result in higher margins beginning later this year and into 2019. Margins should also benefit with the ramp-up of the new programs at our Parsons complex and the associated increase operating leverage. Turning to the electronics segment. Our electronic segment posted revenue of $77.2 million in the fourth quarter versus $81.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $3.2 million of lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $1.5 million decrease in revenue within our military and space end-use markets, all due to shipment timing. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.8 million or 8.8% of revenue versus $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue in the prior year period. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter included a $1.2 million restructuring charge and $1.1 million in higher cost of goods sold tied to revaluing inventory from the LDS acquisition last year. Excluding the restructuring charges and higher cost of goods sold, electronic's operating margin was 11.7% for the 2017 fourth quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter, was $6.9 million or 4.8% of the total company revenue compared to $3.4 million or 2.4% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.8 million, as I mentioned, and higher compensation and benefit cost and higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $8.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $35.4 million for the full year, which was down from $43.3 million in 2016 due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts payable. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018 absent any acquisitions. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4 million in the fourth quarter, which $2.6 million was related to the Parsons facility expansion. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, which is much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we largely completed the investment related to our Parsons' facility expansion.
Overall, we ended the year well-positioned for further growth and higher margins due to our restructuring initiatives, the expansion of the new development programs and the steps being taken to leverage our proprietary processes, technology and titanium expertise on these new platforms. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I've told the investors that I'd take some time fully assessing the company's strengths and weaknesses and actively work and be decisive in building this business into a much better and higher-performing organization. 
During 2017, we laid out plans to do just that. Pleased to say we're on track with various initiatives to enhance margins and accelerate growth. The first phase of our restructuring plan is complete. We have a great deal more in store for 2018 that will position us to achieve approximately $14 million in annualized cost reductions, starting next year. And we will achieve it. At the same time, we're advancing our innovative technology applications and winning new business with likes of Boeing, Airbus, Gulfstream and Ratheon. With our backlog up over $85 million in just a year and building as we move into 2018, it's clear that Ducommun's people are working hard in bringing value-added solutions to all our customers. 
We'll continue to invest in the business, finish the Parsons expansion this spring and look at opportunistic acquisitions as appropriate. The bottom line is that we'll see numerous ways to improve top line growth, even while focusing on enhancing profitability and long-term asset utilization. 
I want to build Ducommun to an enterprise where all parts of the business are running efficiently and operating at their optimum potential, whether it's electronics or structural applications, on defense or on commercial platforms.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 fourth quarter conference call. I'll begin providing an overview of recent developments, after which, Doug Groves, will review our financial results in detail. So we just completed a very important year for Ducommun, one of which will lay the foundation for future growth through several initiatives designed to strengthen our core capabilities. 
As you know, we purchased Lightning Diversion Systems or LDS last September, bolstering our electronics business proprietary technology suitable for numerous aerospace and defense applications. 
I'm pleased to announced that -- you know the LDS has been fully integrated into the company, and that its leader, Dave Wilmot has taken on additional responsibility here at Ducommun to help drive the growth of our electronic segment. Dave is off to a great start in the company as a key part of my leadership team.
We also announced last quarter, the company will begin implementing a multi-stage restructuring program to cut costs, improve operating efficiency and ultimately, increase our asset utilization, particularly with regards to our structure's operation, where we need a good amount of improvement.
While the structures margins are predictably low due to our investment in next-generation programs and the expansion of our Parsons facility, this was a big focus for the Q4 restructuring activities. Therefore, as expected, we began by taking $8.8 million of restructuring charges in the Q4, reflecting actions taken across the entire company, which Doug will review shortly. 
The Structural segment, as mentioned, was 65% of this cost or $5.8 million, where significant work needs to be done. The charges in total encompass severance, lease termination and fixed asset impairments meant to start the process of consolidating functions and eliminating redundancies across the organization. 
We reduced the number of Vice Presidents in the company in our operations from 12 to 6, took out one entire layer of management to flatten the organization and consolidated our business units from 6 to 3. Due to these changes that were difficult to make, we are much more nimble, transparent and close to the customer.
We have also closed some small facilities, written off excess machinery and equipment and continuing the process of exiting fully performing programs such as certain regional and business jet platforms and a few helicopter programs, as we discussed in the past. Our overall adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 5%, excluding restructuring expenses and certain one-time inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to the LDS acquisition. This is versus 5.2% in Q3 and 6.4% last year. 
While we are working out many of the changes and headwinds from 2017, I fully expect, and you should, too, better margins in 2018. We remain on track to complete the company's restructuring program with 2018 and realize approximately $14 million in annual savings, starting next year. And we are driving and committed to be a much better, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industries. 
Another positive development for our investors in the company as we enter the year with a significant uptake in our backlog to a record $726 million. This backlog cuts across both our military and commercial segments and is a great sign for the year ahead.
So I'm feeling very good about 2018. As we work hard, take steps and position the company for faster growth, higher margins and stronger customer relationships, all leveraging our proprietary processes, technology and highly-skilled staff. Now let me provide some color on our end-use markets, products and programs. 
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $63.8 million, down slightly from last year, primarily due to some timing of certain deliveries. While greater rack shipments were lower year-over-year in Q4 as our structural components for military helicopters, we saw a strong growth in the missile defense platform, particularly for Raytheon's Paveway laser-guided systems. This became one of our top defense-related programs for last year. For 2017 as a whole, to comment on military and space revenue, it was just under $260 million, up 13% from 2016 $229 million. Our backlog, again a great story, grew as well, ending 2017 at $277 million versus $256 million beginning of the year, with most of the increase due to awards across our innovative defense and electronic applications. 
Given this level of contract activity, I feel confident that Ducommun will again mark solid performance across military and space platforms this year as well. This is due to the key programs we're on, the ongoing need for technology upgrades with our customers and, of course, the potential for increased defense spending. With our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales were $64.1 million, up just slightly from-- last year, again reflecting shipment timing. Notably, we saw a nice gain in revenue for a large fixed-wing aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. 
Revenues on this platforms were up 28% in 2017 and now represent almost 40% of our commercial aerospace business. We also saw our business on Airbus platforms grow almost 30% in 2017 as we continue to win content with this important and new customer. It's worth noting as well, as previously discussed, to comment as exited fully performing regional and business jet platforms as well as exiting a couple of the helicopter programs, which I've mentioned. 
We ended 2017 with record commercial aerospace backlog of $418 million, up $60 million from where we were at the start of the year. This clearly shows the momentum we're building across the commercial landscape as well as benefit from increased build rates with the large airframe portion of our business. 
In addition, while we made some decisions to exit certain unattractive platforms, the regional business jet space was still bullish on certain opportunities. For example, we're excited about our wins with Gulfstream and look forward to the ramp-up in 2018 of the G500 and G600 series, a new family of large-cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun is a sole source supplier of titanium auxiliary power inlet duct and the cooler ducts for these aircrafts, which we'll supply out of our Parsons facility. 
Along with attractive wins such as this, where we're supplying value-added solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, we also see plenty of room for growth within the jet engine market along with our core narrow-body programs. We're making good progress on many new product introductions we've discussed in the past and expect most of them to be in production the first half of this year. 
These development programs have been somewhat of a drag on margins but are now seeing marketplace success. And given the completion of our Parsons expansion this spring, which will result in slow but steady improvements to our operating leverage along with ongoing ramp-up of new platforms.
Such programs remain on track, including Boeing 737 MAX, our largest. And we're excited about the additional business our state-of-the-art titanium applications can win.
I've seen a lot of progress in Q4 from the team, especially in support of all the organizational changes, and now position the company well for higher growth, margin expansion and improved return for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016. This performance reflects $0.9 million of higher sales with the company's commercial aerospace customers",1223,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $142.3 million, nearly equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2016. This performance reflects $0.9 million of higher sales with the company's commercial aerospace customers and slight gains within our industrial end-use markets offset by $1.3 million of lower revenue across our military and space markets due to shipment timing. Ducommun's backlog rose to $726 million at the end of this quarter, its highest level ever, again, highlighting the key programs we serve as well as the critical components in modules we provide to aerospace OEMs. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.1% in the fourth quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. This decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and is part of our restructuring activities, $0.5 million in inventory write-offs related to an exited commercial helicopter program. SG&A was $20.1 million in the fourth quarter versus $18.6 million in 2016, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and higher professional service fees. 
The company reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $2.7 million or negative 1.9% of revenue versus operating income of $9 million or 6.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily due to the restructuring charges that were $8.7 million greater than in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher amortization of intangible assets related to the LDS acquisition. As Steve mentioned, we implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in November, which, for the quarter, included $5.8 million of charges within our Structural Systems segments, $1.2 million with our Electronic Systems segment, and $1.8 million at the corporate level. These charges represent the initial stage of our restructuring plan, which encompass certain headcount reductions, facility consolidations and fixed asset impairments. We will take further measures in 2018 to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses and rightsize the company. And we anticipate approximately $1 million in charges to be booked in the first quarter of 2018, primarily within the structures business and a total of approximately $10 million this year in restructuring charges. 
As previously noted, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation and noncash items, including the write-off of machinery and equipment. 
For the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as $1.1 million of expense tied to the LDS purchase accounting adjustments in cost to goods sold, Ducommun's adjusted operating margin was 5%. Interest expense was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $2.0 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of LDS. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $4.6 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share on adjusted basis in 2016. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects $17.5 million of lower tax expense due to Congress enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which required the company to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The impact from this tax legislation was a $13 million benefit, which was partially offset by the restructuring charges I just mentioned as well as slightly higher SG&A expenses versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Note that the prior year period did include a $1.2 million net working capital adjustment for which there was no tax-related benefit, and a $0.8 million net of tax adjustment related to the finalization of a divestiture. Going forward, our expected tax rate will be approximately 18% to 19% before ending restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 15.1% or 10.6% of revenue for the comparable period of 2016. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $65.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $60.8 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on large single-aisle platforms. 
Structural Systems posted an operating loss for the quarter of $2.7 million or negative 4.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the restructuring charge of $5.8 million, as I previously mentioned, and unfavorable product mix. Excluding the restructuring charges, Structures' adjusted operating margin was 4.8% for the 2017 fourth quarter. As Steve discussed, we're evaluating and implementing a series of measures to enhance manufacturing efficiency and improve asset utilization across our Structures' business, which we anticipate will result in higher margins beginning later this year and into 2019. Margins should also benefit with the ramp-up of the new programs at our Parsons complex and the associated increase operating leverage. Turning to the electronics segment. Our electronic segment posted revenue of $77.2 million in the fourth quarter versus $81.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $3.2 million of lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $1.5 million decrease in revenue within our military and space end-use markets, all due to shipment timing. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.8 million or 8.8% of revenue versus $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue in the prior year period. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter included a $1.2 million restructuring charge and $1.1 million in higher cost of goods sold tied to revaluing inventory from the LDS acquisition last year. Excluding the restructuring charges and higher cost of goods sold, electronic's operating margin was 11.7% for the 2017 fourth quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter, was $6.9 million or 4.8% of the total company revenue compared to $3.4 million or 2.4% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.8 million, as I mentioned, and higher compensation and benefit cost and higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $8.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $35.4 million for the full year, which was down from $43.3 million in 2016 due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts payable. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018 absent any acquisitions. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4 million in the fourth quarter, which $2.6 million was related to the Parsons facility expansion. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, which is much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we largely completed the investment related to our Parsons' facility expansion.
Overall, we ended the year well-positioned for further growth and higher margins due to our restructuring initiatives, the expansion of the new development programs and the steps being taken to leverage our proprietary processes, technology and titanium expertise on these new platforms. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I've told the investors that I'd take some time fully assessing the company's strengths and weaknesses and actively work and be decisive in building this business into a much better and higher-performing organization. 
During 2017, we laid out plans to do just that. Pleased to say we're on track with various initiatives to enhance margins and accelerate growth. The first phase of our restructuring plan is complete. We have a great deal more in store for 2018 that will position us to achieve approximately $14 million in annualized cost reductions, starting next year. And we will achieve it. At the same time, we're advancing our innovative technology applications and winning new business with likes of Boeing, Airbus, Gulfstream and Raytheon. With our backlog up over $85 million in just a year and building as we move into 2018, it's clear that Ducommun's people are working hard in bringing value-added solutions to all our customers. 
We'll continue to invest in the business, finish the Parsons expansion this spring and look at opportunistic acquisitions as appropriate. The bottom line is that we'll see numerous ways to improve top line growth, even while focusing on enhancing profitability and long-term asset utilization. 
I want to build Ducommun to an enterprise where all parts of the business are running efficiently and operating at their optimum potential, whether it's electronics or structural applications, on defense or on commercial platforms.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments of the company after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.First",1084,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you for everyone for joining us today for our 2018 first quarter conference call. 
I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments of the company after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
First, I'm very pleased to give an update on many changes taking place at Ducommun. As we drive to position the business for higher growth and stronger operating results going forward. We continue to rationalize our footprints this quarter, resulting a $2.2 million of restructuring charges, on top of the $8.8 million taken last year. 
Our most recent actions involved the write-down or consolidation of additional assets, along with severance cost. Similar to Q4, as we work to reduce about 70% of our total manufacturing force base along with staff reduction of above 6% by the end of 2018. As previously discussed, we are on track to take restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the entire life of the program. And we will meet the committed savings of roughly $14 million annually, beginning in 2019.
We do not take these actions lightly. And I also want to share that the team has done a very effective job, implementing the changes, which will strengthen the company today in the many years ahead. At the same time, we haven't let our actions impact our customer performance or our internal organization. As we strive to provide the very best customer service, quality and on-time product delivery.
As proof of our actions, Ducommun's backlog serves again this quarter to roughly $820 million. That's up nearly 13% or $94 million sequentially from Q4 and more than $200 million over this time a year ago. This is truly exciting and speaks to our capabilities and trust that customers have put in us that to provide high-value, innovative solutions as the aerospace defense markets continue to grow.
We are also winning new orders across a multitude of products and platforms, including engine components as well as benefiting from the Lightning Diversion Systems acquisition, leaving us extremely well positioned for faster growth in the years to come.
I'm also pleased to see the continued sequential improvement in our Structural Segment margins. As Doug will review in a moment, structures adjusted operating margin rose to 5.8% this quarter from 4.8% in Q4. 
An increase of 100 basis points. We expect to see further margin expansion going forward. As I mentioned last year, the margins of structures were unacceptable and through cost reductions, leadership changes, a farewell mix, and higher volumes, we're now seeing the results.
Overall, for the company, total adjusted operating income rose over $1.4 million or 33% from Q1 of 2017.
We've also generated $10.3 million of cash during the quarter, which is great news for investors. We also recently completed in April, a second Bolton of acquisition following the purchase of LDS last year. This latest transaction of certified thermoplastics also known as CTP, boasted our capabilities in assemblies of resins, compounds and alloys. For a wide range of Commercial Aerospace, Defense, Medical and Industrial applications. 
As I mentioned in the past, one of my goals through Ducommun is to strengthen our profile in high value-added products and components, leveraging our existing intellectual property while augmenting and expanding our engineering expertise. 
CTP adds to the company's proprietary capabilities in aerostructures, and expands our footprint into an entirely new market, Aircraft Interiors. As well as provide an opportunity for very important aftermarket sales. 
CTP's current President and major shareholder, Robert Duncan, has agreed to stay on for a while to assist with the integration and ensure a successful transition. We're happy with the organization, and please that how quickly Robert and his team have adopted to the being part of the Ducommun family and things are moving in a positive direction. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our node turning space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $66.3 million, and continued to see strong missile and defense delivery, such as the Raytheon MK 48 and MK 54 missile systems. We anticipate good growth going forward across this sector. And are pleased with the Defense Department's current spending priorities. 
Having a budget filing in place provides transparency and greater predictability to forward demand, and perhaps not coincidently, our Military Space cycle grew to nearly $319 million during the quarter. This is our highest it has been in 5 years. So we're extremely pleased. 
In our Commercial Aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose nearly $14 million year-over-year to $72.5 million. It at highest level ever. We again saw significant growth across our large Exley aircraft applications, particularly, on the Boeing 737 platforms and A320 family. We also posted the gains with Gulfstream and are making steady progress, ramping up production for many platforms that are recently expanded Parsons facility, along with Ducommun's [indiscernible] New York facility. 
We expect to see a great deal of operating leverage this year in as these locations increase their output for the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and certain Airbus models, including the A320 and A330 as well as Gulfstream G500, G600, G650. 
Given our advanced manufacturing methods in the titanium components produced, both performance as a serves the centerpiece for our next-generation capabilities. In addition, we now have new leaders at both sites and stay tuned for the many improvements this year into 2019.
Our Commercial Aerospace backlight at the end of Q1 hit another record at $470 million, boasted by some large orders in structural components on the Boeing 737 MAX. In addition to bookings have not yet reflected certain entry related wins that we hope to announce in the very near future. That said, the share magnitude of our backlog speeds volumes about our customer relationships, teamwork and court abilities. We continue to see solid sequential growth across our Commercial Aerospace business, driven by platforms that encompass nearly all of our customer product segments. It's clearly an exciting time to be a key supplier in the aerospace industry. So we remain focused on the fundamentals as I have been talking about, hiring top talent, demanding excellence in every area of Ducommun, streamlining the company positioning it for higher production volumes and improved operating performance in the quarters ahead. I'm optimistic about the outlook for 2018 and beyond, and look forward to greater returns for our dedicated shareholders. 
With that, I will now have Doug review our financial in details. Doug?"
267761,560351379,1460007,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you Steve, and good day everyone. As we mentioned during the Safe Harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB accounting standards classification, ASC",1143,"Thank you Steve, and good day everyone. As we mentioned during the Safe Harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB accounting standards classification, ASC topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. 
We are using the modified retrospective method of adoption since the past financial results have not been adjusted for comparison purposes. Please see the company's filings in today's press release for further description of this versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
So turning to the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $150.5 million versus $136.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $14.1 million of higher sales with the company's Commercial Aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large fixed wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737. 
Ducommun's backlog rose to nearly $820 million at the end of the quarter, its highest level ever, up nearly $94 million sequentially from Q4 and over $200 million from a year ago, as Steve just mentioned.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 17.8% in the first quarter versus 18.3% in the prior year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to higher other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing volume. 
SG&A was $19.3 million in the first quarter versus $20.8 million in 2017, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring activities and that was partially offset by higher professional service fees.
The company reported an operating income for the first quarter of $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue, versus operating income of $4.3 million or 3.1% of revenue in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $5.6 million or 4.1% of sales, compared to 4.3% or 3.1% of revenue, up nearly 33% as Steve mentioned quarter-over-quarter. 
Our Q1 restructuring initiatives included approximate $1.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $0.5 million within Electronic Systems segment, and $1.8 million in the corporate level was taken together add to the $2.2 million in the quarter. These charges were taken as the company continues to consolidate its footprint and reduce headcount such that by year-end we expect to have 17% less manufacturing square footage, and approximately 6% fewer staff. 
We're on track to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019, and currently anticipate taking $5 million in restructuring charges during the second quarter as we continue through all our restructuring initiatives. As 
noted previously, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation, and noncash items including the write-off of machinery and equipment. As Steve mentioned, we expect the total restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the life of the entire program, which runs through the end of 2018.
Interest expense was $2.9 million the first quarter of 2018 versus $1.7 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of the LDS as previously discussed. We anticipate with the purchase of CTP, interest expense would be approximately $3 million next quarter. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects the higher revenue, lower SG&A, partially offset by the restructuring charges and higher interest expense I just mentioned. 
Adjusted net income for Q1 was $2.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% this year before any restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of 2018 was $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $11.9 million or 8.7% for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $82.4 million in the first quarter versus $78.7 million in the prior year. These results reflect $5.6 million of higher sales to Military and Space customers, slightly offset by modest declines in our Industrial markets. Electronic systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $5.7 million or 7% of revenue versus $7.1 million or 9% of revenue in the prior year. As Steve mentioned, the 2,000 first quarter was negatively impacted by some product mix but we expect margins to bounce back to more normal level in Q2. The electronics adjusted operating margin was 8.9% for the 2018 first quarter.
Turning to the Structural System segment. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $68 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $57.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to the $13.2 million of higher sales across our Commercial Aerospace applications, particularly, on large jet single out platforms, was more than offset to $2.0 million decline in Military and Space market just reflecting shipment timing. Structural segments posted operating income for the quarter of $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.8 million or 4.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volumes, when given the restructuring charges of 1.6. 
The structure's adjusted operating margin was 5.8% for the first quarter, and up 100 basis points as Steve mentioned from the prior quarter. As Steve discussed, we anticipate margins will trend higher as the year progresses based upon our ongoing streamlining activities and initiatives to improve asset utilization. Margins will also continue to benefit with the ramp-up of new programs at our Parsons facility and associated operating leverage. 
CG&A, corporate, general administrative expenses for the first quarter was $4.9 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 4% of revenue last year. The decline in CG&A expense was primarily due to lower compensation and benefit cost as a result of our restructuring activities and was partially offset by higher professional service fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we generated $10.3 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 versus $13.2 million in 2017. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of Capex, we spent $3.2 million during the quarter, and we anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we largely completed the investment related to our Parsons facility expansion.
Overall, we're pleased with our restructuring progress, new business wins and the acquisitions recently consummated. We believe the company is on solid footing to post higher growth and improve financial results in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.First, I",1086,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2018 first quarter conference call. 
I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
First, I'm very pleased to give an update on the many changes taking place at Ducommun, as we drive to position the business for higher growth and stronger operating results going forward. We continue to rationalize our footprint this quarter, resulting in $2.2 million of restructuring charges, on top of the $8.8 million taken last year. 
Our most recent actions involved the write-down or consolidation of additional assets, along with severance cost, similar to Q4, as we work to reduce about 70% of our total manufacturing floor space, along with staff reductions above 6% by the end of 2018. As previously discussed, we are on track to take restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the entire life of the program. And we will meet the committed savings of roughly $14 million annually, beginning in 2019.
We do not take these actions lightly. And I also want to share that the team has done a very effective job implementing the changes, which will strengthen the company today and the many years ahead. At the same time, we haven't let our actions impact our customer performance or our internal organization as we strive to provide the very best customer service, quality and on-time product delivery.
As proof of our actions, Ducommun's backlog surged again this quarter to roughly $820 million. That's up nearly 13% or $94 million sequentially from Q4 and more than $200 million over this time a year ago. This is truly exciting and speaks to our capabilities and trust that customers have put in us to provide high-value innovative solutions as the aerospace defense markets continue to grow.
We are also winning new orders across a multitude of products and platforms, including engine components as well as benefiting from the Lightning Diversion Systems acquisition, leaving us extremely well positioned for faster growth in the years to come.
I'm also pleased to see the continued sequential improvement in our Structural segment margins. As Doug will review in a moment, structures adjusted operating margin rose to 5.8% this quarter from 4.8% in Q4, an increase of 100 basis points.  We expect to see further margin expansion going forward. 
As I mentioned last year, the margins for structures were unacceptable and through cost reductions, leadership changes, a favorable mix and higher volumes, we are now seeing the results.
Overall for the company, total adjusted operating income rose over $1.4 million or 33% from Q1 of 2017. And we also generated $10.3 million of cash during the quarter, which is great news for investors. We also recently completed, in April, a second bolt-on acquisition following the purchase of LDS last year. This latest transaction of Certified Thermoplastics, also known as CTP, bolsters our capability in extruded assemblies of resins, compounds and alloys for a wide range of commercial aerospace, defense, medical and industrial applications. 
As I mentioned in the past, one of my goals for Ducommun is to strengthen our profile in high value-added products and components, leveraging our existing intellectual property, while augmenting and expanding our engineering expertise. 
CTP adds to the company's proprietary capabilities in aerostructures and expands our footprint into an entirely new market, aircraft interiors, as well as provide the opportunity for very important aftermarket sales. 
CTP's current President and major shareholder, Robert Duncan, has agreed to stay on for a while to assist with the integration and ensure a successful transition. We're happy with the organization, and pleased at how quickly Robert and his team have adapted to being part of the Ducommun family, and things are moving in a positive direction. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $66.3 million, and continue to see strong missile and defense deliveries such as the Raytheon MK 48 and MK 54 missile systems. We anticipate good growth going forward across this sector, and are pleased with the Defense Department's current spending priorities. 
Having a budget finally in place provides transparency and greater predictability to forward demand, and perhaps not coincidentally, our military and space cycle grew to nearly $319 million during the quarter. This is our highest it has been in 5 years. So we're extremely pleased. 
In our Commercial Aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose nearly $14 million year-over-year to $72.5 million. It's its highest level ever. We again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and A320 family. We also posted gains with Gulfstream and are making steady progress ramping up production for many platforms at our recently expanded Parsons facility, along with Ducommun's Coxsackie, New York facility. 
We expect to see a great deal of operating leverage this year as these locations increase their output for the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and certain Airbus models, including the A320 and A330 as well as Gulfstream G500, G600 and G650. 
Given our advanced manufacturing methods and the titanium components produced, both performances serve as the centerpiece for our next-generation capabilities. In addition, we now have new leaders at both sites. And stay tuned for the many improvements this year and in 2019.
Our Commercial Aerospace backlog at the end of Q1 hit another record, nearly $470 million, bolstered by some large orders in structural components on the Boeing 737 MAX. In addition, the correlated booking does not yet reflected certain entry related wins that we hope to announce in the very near future. That said, the share magnitude of our backlog speaks volumes about our customer relationships, teamwork and core capabilities. We continue to see solid sequential growth across our Commercial Aerospace business, driven by platforms that encompass nearly all of our customer and product segments. 
It's clearly an exciting time to be a key supplier in the aerospace industry. So we remain focused on the fundamentals, as I have been talking about, hiring top talent, demanding excellence in every area of Ducommun, streamlining the company, positioning it for higher production volumes and improved operating performance in the quarters ahead. I'm optimistic about the outlook for 2018 and beyond, and look forward to greater returns for our dedicated shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,560351379,1460768,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,",1153,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. 
We are using the modified retrospective method of adoption since the past financial results have not been adjusted for comparison purposes. Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
So turning to the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $150.5 million versus $136.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $14.1 million of higher sales with the company's Commercial Aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large fixed-wing platform, such as the Boeing 737. 
Ducommun's backlog rose to nearly $820 million at the end of the quarter, its highest level ever, up nearly $94 million sequentially from Q4 and over $200 million from a year ago, as Steve just mentioned.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 17.8% in the first quarter versus 18.3% in the prior year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to higher other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing volume. 
SG&A was $19.3 million in the first quarter versus $20.8 million in 2017, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring activities, and that was partially offset by higher professional service fees.
The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue, versus operating income of $4.3 million or 3.1% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $5.6 million or 4.1% of sales, compared to 4.3% or 3.1% of revenue, up nearly 33% as Steve mentioned quarter-over-quarter. 
Our Q1 restructuring initiatives included approximately $1.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment; $0.5 million within our Electronic Systems segment; and $0.1 million at the corporate level was taken together, add to the $2.2 million in the quarter. These charges were taken as the company continues to consolidate its footprint and reduce headcount such that by year end we expect to have 17% less manufacturing square footage and approximately 6% fewer staff. 
We're on track to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019, and currently anticipate taking $5 million in restructured charges during the second quarter as we continue through all our restructuring initiatives. 
As noted previously, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation, and noncash items including the write-off of machinery and equipment. As Steve mentioned, we expect the total restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the life of the entire program, which runs through the end of 2018.  
Interest expense was $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $1.7 million last year due to a higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of the LDS, as previously discussed. We anticipate, with the purchase of CTP, interest expense will be approximately $3 million next quarter. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects the higher revenue, lower SG&A, partially offset by the restructuring charges and higher interest expense I just mentioned. 
Adjusted net income for Q1 was $2.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% this year before any restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter -- of 2018 was $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $11.9 million or 8.7% for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $82.4 million in the first quarter versus $78.7 million in the prior year. These results reflect $5.6 million of higher sales to military and space customers, slightly offset by modest declines in our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $5.7 million or 7% of revenue versus $7.1 million or 9% of revenue in the prior year.  As Steve mentioned, the 2000 (sic) [ 2018 ] first quarter was negatively impacted by some product mix but we expect margins to bounce back to more normal levels in Q2. The electronics adjusted operating margin was 8.9% for the 2018 first quarter.
Turning to the Structural Systems segment. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $68 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $57.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $13.2 million of higher sales across our Commercial Aerospace applications, particularly on large jet single aisle platforms, which more than offset $2.0 million decline in our Military and Space markets just reflecting shipment timing. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.8 million or 4.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volumes, even given the restructuring charges of 1.6. 
The structures adjusted operating margin was 5.8% for the first quarter and up 100 basis points, as Steve mentioned, from the prior quarter. As Steve discussed, we anticipate margins will trend higher as the year progresses based upon our ongoing streamlining activities and initiatives to improve asset utilization. Margins will also continue to benefit from the ramp-up of new programs at our Parsons facility and associated operating leverage. 
CG&A, corporate, general administrative expenses for the first quarter was $4.9 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 4% of revenue last year. The decline in CG&A expense was primarily due to lower compensation and benefit cost as a result of our restructuring activities and was partially offset by higher professional service fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we generated $10.3 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 versus $13.2 million in 2017. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter, and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $3.2 million during the quarter, and we anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we've largely completed the investment related to our Parsons facility expansion.
Overall, we're pleased with our restructuring progress, new business wins and the acquisitions recently consummated. We believe the company is on solid footing to post higher growth and improve financial results in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.First, I",1086,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2018 first quarter conference call. 
I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
First, I'm very pleased to give an update on the many changes taking place at Ducommun, as we drive to position the business for higher growth and stronger operating results going forward. We continue to rationalize our footprint this quarter, resulting in $2.2 million of restructuring charges, on top of the $8.8 million taken last year. 
Our most recent actions involved the write-down or consolidation of additional assets, along with severance cost, similar to Q4, as we work to reduce about 17% of our total manufacturing floor space, along with staff reductions above 6% by the end of 2018. As previously discussed, we are on track to take restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the entire life of the program. And we will meet the committed savings of roughly $14 million annually, beginning in 2019.
We do not take these actions lightly. And I also want to share that the team has done a very effective job implementing the changes, which will strengthen the company today and the many years ahead. At the same time, we haven't let our actions impact our customer performance or our internal organization as we strive to provide the very best customer service, quality and on-time product delivery.
As proof of our actions, Ducommun's backlog surged again this quarter to roughly $820 million. That's up nearly 13% or $94 million sequentially from Q4 and more than $200 million over this time a year ago. This is truly exciting and speaks to our capabilities and trust that customers have put in us to provide high-value innovative solutions as the aerospace defense markets continue to grow.
We are also winning new orders across a multitude of products and platforms, including engine components as well as benefiting from the Lightning Diversion Systems acquisitions, leaving us extremely well positioned for faster growth in the years to come.
I'm also pleased to see the continued sequential improvement in our Structural segment margins. As Doug will review in a moment, structures adjusted operating margin rose to 5.8% this quarter from 4.8% in Q4, an increase of 100 basis points.  We expect to see further margin expansion going forward. 
As I mentioned last year, the margins for structures were unacceptable and through cost reductions, leadership changes, a favorable mix and higher volumes, we are now seeing the results.
Overall for the company, total adjusted operating income rose over $1.4 million or 33% from Q1 of 2017. And we also generated $10.3 million of cash during the quarter, which is great news for investors. We also recently completed, in April, a second bolt-on acquisition following the purchase of LDS last year. This latest transaction of Certified Thermoplastics, also known as CTP, bolsters our capability in extruded assemblies of resins, compounds and alloys for a wide range of commercial aerospace, defense, medical and industrial applications. 
As I mentioned in the past, one of my goals for Ducommun is to strengthen our profile in high value-added products and components, leveraging our existing intellectual property, while augmenting and expanding our engineering expertise. 
CTP adds to the company's proprietary capabilities in aerostructures and expands our footprint into an entirely new market, aircraft interiors, as well as provide the opportunity for very important aftermarket sales. 
CTP's current President and major shareholder, Robert Duncan, has agreed to stay on for a while to assist with the integration and ensure a successful transition. We're happy with the organization, and pleased at how quickly Robert and his team have adapted to being part of the Ducommun family, and things are moving in a positive direction. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $66.3 million, and continue to see strong missile and defense deliveries such as the Raytheon MK 48 and MK 54 missile systems. We anticipate good growth going forward across this sector, and are pleased with the Defense Department's current spending priorities. 
Having a budget finally in place provides transparency and greater predictability to forward demand, and perhaps not coincidentally, our military and space cycle grew to nearly $319 million during the quarter. This is our highest it has been in 5 years. So we're extremely pleased. 
In our Commercial Aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose nearly $14 million year-over-year to $72.5 million. It's its highest level ever. We again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and A320 family. We also posted gains with Gulfstream and are making steady progress ramping up production for many platforms at our recently expanded Parsons facility, along with Ducommun's Coxsackie, New York facility. 
We expect to see a great deal of operating leverage this year as these locations increase their output for the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and certain Airbus models, including the A320 and A330 as well as Gulfstream G500, G600 and G650. 
Given our advanced manufacturing methods and the titanium components produced, both performances serve as the centerpiece for our next-generation capabilities. In addition, we now have new leaders at both sites. And stay tuned for the many improvements this year and in 2019.
Our Commercial Aerospace backlog at the end of Q1 hit another record, nearly $470 million, bolstered by some large orders in structural components on the Boeing 737 MAX. In addition, the correlated booking does not yet reflected certain entry related wins that we hope to announce in the very near future. That said, the share magnitude of our backlog speaks volumes about our customer relationships, teamwork and core capabilities. We continue to see solid sequential growth across our Commercial Aerospace business, driven by platforms that encompass nearly all of our customer and product segments. 
It's clearly an exciting time to be a key supplier in the aerospace industry. So we remain focused on the fundamentals, as I have been talking about, hiring top talent, demanding excellence in every area of Ducommun, streamlining the company, positioning it for higher production volumes and improved operating performance in the quarters ahead. I'm optimistic about the outlook for 2018 and beyond, and look forward to greater returns for our dedicated shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,560351379,1461238,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,",1149,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. 
We are using the modified retrospective method of adoption since the past financial results have not been adjusted for comparison purposes. Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
So turning to the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $150.5 million versus $136.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $14.1 million of higher sales with the company's Commercial Aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large fixed-wing platform, such as the Boeing 737. 
Ducommun's backlog rose to nearly $820 million at the end of the quarter, its highest level ever, up nearly $94 million sequentially from Q4 and over $200 million from a year ago, as Steve just mentioned.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 17.8% in the first quarter versus 18.3% in the prior year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to higher other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing volume. 
SG&A was $19.3 million in the first quarter versus $20.8 million in 2017, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring activities, and that was partially offset by higher professional service fees.
The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue, versus operating income of $4.3 million or 3.1% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $5.6 million or 4.1% of sales, compared to 4.3% or 3.1% of revenue, up nearly 33% as Steve mentioned quarter-over-quarter. 
Our Q1 restructuring initiatives included approximately $1.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment; $0.5 million within our Electronic Systems segment; and $0.1 million at the corporate level which, taken together, add to the $2.2 million in the quarter. These charges were taken as the company continues to consolidate its footprint and reduce headcount such that by year-end we expect to have 17% less manufacturing square footage and approximately 6% fewer staff. 
We're on track to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019, and currently anticipate taking $5 million in restructure charges during the second quarter as we continue through all our restructuring initiatives. 
As noted previously, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation, and noncash items including the write-off of machinery and equipment. As Steve mentioned, we expect the total restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the life of the entire program, which runs through the end of 2018.  
Interest expense was $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $1.7 million last year due to a higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of the LDS, as previously discussed. We anticipate, with the purchase of CTP, interest expense will be approximately $3 million next quarter. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects the higher revenue, lower SG&A, partially offset by the restructuring charges and higher interest expense I just mentioned. 
Adjusted net income for Q1 was $2.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% this year before any restructuring charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter -- of 2018 was $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $11.9 million or 8.7% for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $82.4 million in the first quarter versus $78.7 million in the prior year. These results reflect $5.6 million of higher sales to military and space customers, slightly offset by modest declines in our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $5.7 million or 7% of revenue versus $7.1 million or 9% of revenue in the prior year.  As Steve mentioned, the 2000 (sic) first quarter was negatively impacted by some product mix but we expect margins to bounce back to more normal levels in Q2. The electronics adjusted operating margin was 8.9% for the 2018 first quarter.
Turning to the Structural Systems segment. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $68 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $57.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $13.2 million of higher sales across our Commercial Aerospace applications, particularly on large jet single aisle platforms, which more than offset $2.0 million decline in our Military and Space markets just reflecting shipment timing. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.8 million or 4.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volumes, even given the restructuring charges of 1.6. 
The structure's adjusted operating margin was 5.8% for the first quarter and up 100 basis points, as Steve mentioned, from the prior quarter. As Steve discussed, we anticipate margins will trend higher as the year progresses based upon our ongoing streamlining activities and initiatives to improve asset utilization. Margins will also continue to benefit from the ramp-up of new programs at our Parsons facility and associated operating leverage. 
CG&A, corporate general administrative expenses for the first quarter was $4.9 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 4% of revenue last year. The decline in CG&A expense was primarily due to lower compensation and benefit cost as a result of our restructuring activities and was partially offset by higher professional service fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we generated $10.3 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 versus $13.2 million in 2017. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter, and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $3.2 million during the quarter, and we anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we've largely completed the investment related to our Parsons facility expansion.
Overall, we're pleased with our restructuring progress, new business wins and the acquisitions recently consummated. We believe the company is on solid footing to post higher growth and improve financial results in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

267761,560351379,1462681,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2018 first quarter conference call.I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.First, I'",1086,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2018 first quarter conference call.
I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments at the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
First, I'm very pleased to give an update on the many changes taking place at Ducommun, as we drive to position the business for higher growth and stronger operating results going forward. We continue to rationalize our footprint this quarter, resulting in $2.2 million of restructuring charges, on top of the $8.8 million taken last year.
Our most recent actions involved the write-down or consolidation of additional assets, along with severance cost, similar to Q4, as we work to reduce about 17% of our total manufacturing floor space, along with staff reductions above 6% by the end of 2018. As previously discussed, we are on track to take restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the entire life of the program. And we will meet the committed savings of roughly $14 million annually, beginning in 2019.
We do not take these actions lightly. And I also want to share that the team has done a very effective job implementing the changes, which will strengthen the company today and the many years ahead. At the same time, we haven't let our actions impact our customer performance or our internal organization as we strive to provide the very best customer service, quality and on-time product delivery.
As proof of our actions, Ducommun's backlog surged again this quarter to roughly $820 million. That's up nearly 13% or $94 million sequentially from Q4 and more than $200 million over this time a year ago. This is truly exciting and speaks to our capabilities and trust that customers have put in us to provide high-value innovative solutions as the aerospace defense markets continue to grow.
We are also winning new orders across a multitude of products and platforms, including engine components as well as benefiting from the Lightning Diversion Systems acquisitions, leaving us extremely well positioned for faster growth in the years to come.
I'm also pleased to see the continued sequential improvement in our Structural segment margins. As Doug will review in a moment, structures adjusted operating margin rose to 5.8% this quarter from 4.8% in Q4, an increase of 100 basis points.  We expect to see further margin expansion going forward.
As I mentioned last year, the margins for structures were unacceptable and through cost reductions, leadership changes, a favorable mix and higher volumes, we are now seeing the results.
Overall for the company, total adjusted operating income rose over $1.4 million or 33% from Q1 of 2017. And we also generated $10.3 million of cash during the quarter, which is great news for investors. We also recently completed, in April, a second bolt-on acquisition following the purchase of LDS last year. This latest transaction of Certified Thermoplastics, also known as CTP, bolsters our capability in extruded assemblies of resins, compounds and alloys for a wide range of commercial aerospace, defense, medical and industrial applications.
As I mentioned in the past, one of my goals for Ducommun is to strengthen our profile in high value-added products and components, leveraging our existing intellectual property, while augmenting and expanding our engineering expertise.
CTP adds to the company's proprietary capabilities in aerostructures and expands our footprint into an entirely new market, aircraft interiors, as well as provide the opportunity for very important aftermarket sales.
CTP's current President and major shareholder, Robert Duncan, has agreed to stay on for a while to assist with the integration and ensure a successful transition. We're happy with the organization, and pleased at how quickly Robert and his team have adapted to being part of the Ducommun family, and things are moving in a positive direction.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $66.3 million, and continue to see strong missile and defense deliveries such as the Raytheon MK 48 and MK 54 missile systems. We anticipate good growth going forward across this sector, and are pleased with the Defense Department's current spending priorities.
Having a budget finally in place provides transparency and greater predictability to forward demand, and perhaps not coincidentally, our military and space cycle grew to nearly $319 million during the quarter. This is our highest it has been in 5 years. So we're extremely pleased.
In our Commercial Aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose nearly $14 million year-over-year to $72.5 million. It's its highest level ever. We again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, particularly on the Boeing 737 platforms and A320 family. We also posted gains with Gulfstream and are making steady progress ramping up production for many platforms at our recently expanded Parsons facility, along with Ducommun's Coxsackie, New York facility.
We expect to see a great deal of operating leverage this year as these locations increase their output for the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and certain Airbus models, including the A320 and A330 as well as Gulfstream G500, G600 and G650.
Given our advanced manufacturing methods and the titanium components produced, both performances serve as the centerpiece for our next-generation capabilities. In addition, we now have new leaders at both sites. And stay tuned for the many improvements this year and in 2019.
Our Commercial Aerospace backlog at the end of Q1 hit another record, nearly $470 million, bolstered by some large orders in structural components on the Boeing 737 MAX. In addition, the correlated booking does not yet reflected certain entry related wins that we hope to announce in the very near future. That said, the share magnitude of our backlog speaks volumes about our customer relationships, teamwork and core capabilities. We continue to see solid sequential growth across our Commercial Aerospace business, driven by platforms that encompass nearly all of our customer and product segments.
It's clearly an exciting time to be a key supplier in the aerospace industry. So we remain focused on the fundamentals, as I have been talking about, hiring top talent, demanding excellence in every area of Ducommun, streamlining the company, positioning it for higher production volumes and improved operating performance in the quarters ahead. I'm optimistic about the outlook for 2018 and beyond, and look forward to greater returns for our dedicated shareholders.
With that, I'm going to have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,560351379,1462681,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,",1152,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As was mentioned during the safe harbor introductory statements, all of our comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results.
We are using the modified retrospective method of adoption since the past financial results have not been adjusted for comparison purposes. Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
So turning to the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $150.5 million versus $136.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $14.1 million of higher sales with the company's Commercial Aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large fixed-wing platform, such as the Boeing 737.
Ducommun's backlog rose to nearly $820 million at the end of the quarter, its highest level ever, up nearly $94 million sequentially from Q4 and over $200 million from a year ago, as Steve just mentioned.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 17.8% in the first quarter versus 18.3% in the prior year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to higher other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing volume.
SG&A was $19.3 million in the first quarter versus $20.8 million in 2017, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring activities, and that was partially offset by higher professional service fees.
The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue, versus operating income of $4.3 million or 3.1% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $5.6 million or 4.1% of sales, compared to 4.3% or 3.1% of revenue, up nearly 33% as Steve mentioned quarter-over-quarter.
Our Q1 restructuring initiatives included approximately $1.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment; $0.5 million within our Electronic Systems segment; and $0.1 million at the corporate level which, taken together, add to the $2.2 million in the quarter. These charges were taken as the company continues to consolidate its footprint and reduce headcount such that by year-end we expect to have 17% less manufacturing square footage and approximately 6% fewer staff.
We're on track to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019, and currently anticipate taking $5 million in restructure charges during the second quarter as we continue through all our restructuring initiatives.
As noted previously, these charges will be a mix of cash outlays, typically for severance and facility consolidation, and noncash items including the write-off of machinery and equipment. As Steve mentioned, we expect the total restructuring charges of approximately $20 million to $22 million over the life of the entire program, which runs through the end of 2018.
Interest expense was $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $1.7 million last year due to a higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisition of the LDS, as previously discussed. We anticipate, with the purchase of CTP, interest expense will be approximately $3 million next quarter.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income reflects the higher revenue, lower SG&A, partially offset by the restructuring charges and higher interest expense I just mentioned.
Adjusted net income for Q1 was $2.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% this year before any restructuring charges.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter -- of 2018 was $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $11.9 million or 8.7% for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $82.4 million in the first quarter versus $78.7 million in the prior year. These results reflect $5.6 million of higher sales to military and space customers, slightly offset by modest declines in our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $5.7 million or 7% of revenue versus $7.1 million or 9% of revenue in the prior year.  As Steve mentioned, the 2000 (sic) [ 2018 ] first quarter was negatively impacted by some product mix but we expect margins to bounce back to more normal levels in Q2. The electronics adjusted operating margin was 8.9% for the 2018 first quarter.
Turning to the Structural Systems segment. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $68 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $57.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $13.2 million of higher sales across our Commercial Aerospace applications, particularly on large jet single aisle platforms, which more than offset $2.0 million decline in our Military and Space markets just reflecting shipment timing. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.8 million or 4.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volumes, even given the restructuring charges of 1.6.
The structure's adjusted operating margin was 5.8% for the first quarter and up 100 basis points, as Steve mentioned, from the prior quarter. As Steve discussed, we anticipate margins will trend higher as the year progresses based upon our ongoing streamlining activities and initiatives to improve asset utilization. Margins will also continue to benefit from the ramp-up of new programs at our Parsons facility and associated operating leverage.
CG&A, corporate general administrative expenses for the first quarter was $4.9 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 4% of revenue last year. The decline in CG&A expense was primarily due to lower compensation and benefit cost as a result of our restructuring activities and was partially offset by higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we generated $10.3 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 versus $13.2 million in 2017. We also paid down $6.6 million of debt in the quarter, and expect to pay down $25 million to $30 million in 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $3.2 million during the quarter, and we anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018, much less than the $27.6 million in 2017, as we've largely completed the investment related to our Parsons facility expansion.
Overall, we're pleased with our restructuring progress, new business wins and the acquisitions recently consummated. We believe the company is on solid footing to post higher growth and improve financial results in the quarters to come.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company. After which with Doug will view our financial results in detail. 
Q2 performance is certainly a very good step forward for the company. The significant progress clearly show the impact from many initiatives put in place since my arrival in January 2017 to enhance top line growth, expand margins and generally produce more consistent, positive financial results. 
Revenue for the quarter rose nearly 10% year-over-year to $154.8 million as we better it from strong demand across nearly every aspect of our business. It's great to see the benefits of our efforts as growth on key platforms and recent wins drive top line performance.
In addition, the strong focus on operational excellence, advanced technology and our 2 acquisitions are strengthening Ducommun's position as the unique provider of a broader array of electronic and structural applications with Aerospace and Defense industry. 
Ducommun grew margins nicely this quarter and as expected. The company's gross margin rose 210 basis points to 20.7% from 18.6% last year, reflecting higher volumes and improved mix, and our adjusted operating margin climbed 100 basis points to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2017. 
Notably, and I'm pleased to tell you our structure's adjusted operating margin, which has been a key focus for us since I arrived, rose sequentially 440 basis points, 10.2% this quarter from 5.8% in Q1, and 540 basis points from 4.8% in Q4. 
I'm sure you'll agree that the progress is very encouraging, and was helped by favorable product mix and increased volume. 
We're also took another $5.4 million of restructuring charges this quarter, on top of the $11 million previously books. In connection with our various streamlining sharers that cut across all facets of our organization.
We remain on track to eliminate roughly 16% of our forward space by year-end and reduce that by 6%, which will result in savings previously announced of about $14 million annual cost going forward.
We've already completed many of the efficiency improvements within our structures group, including excess capacity in California. And most of the remaining restructuring will target our electronic segment. 
During the quarter, we announced a closure of our Phoenix Arizona planned, and we're moving that capability to our Huntsville Arkansas facility by fiscal year-end. 
I also want to take this time to recognize our Phoenix team for their professionalism. 
We ended the quarter, once again, with strong backlog of $823 million, leaving the company well positioned for growth and further performance improvement heading into 2019. 
In addition, we generated $15.9 million in cash from operations during the period, resulting in $26.2 million of cash flow year-to-date. 
At the same time, our acquisitions of LDS and CTP are fully integrated, contributing financially and broadening Ducommun's technology portfolio.
Regarding our acquisitions, I would also want to emphasize to investors that Fortune 100 executive level talent is leading this important process and driving acquisition decisions. 
Overall, our team is keenly focused on taking the company to the next level in terms of operating excellence. I'm very positive about what we've had accomplished and where we stand on transformation of the company.
Now let me provide you some color on end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our Military and Space sector, we've posted second quarter revenue of $70.3 million, up slightly from last year reflecting higher shipments for the F-16 and F-18 programs, as well as increased deliveries for certain missile and defense programs. 
Please keep in mind that we are also always reviewing and rationalizing poor performing programs.
We anticipate continued growth across our key platforms going forward, and expect strong [indiscernible] support for defense spending on Capitol Hill as budget priorities were formulated for fiscal 2019.
Our Military and Space backlog grew as well to roughly $323 million during the quarter, up modestly from Q1.
Then our Commercial Aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose approximately $29 million year-over-year to $71.8 million. We once again saw significant growth across large fixed wing aircraft operations, driven by high build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and Airbus A320 family. 
As I mentioned earlier, these increased levels of production, combined with our restructuring management and better operational performance are generating benefit shown in margin expansion, typically within our structures group. We expect further operating leverage in the future as we continue our restructuring program. Although, quarter-over-quarter results can vary due to overall product mix. 
Backlog within Commercial Aerospace remains solid at $416 million, down slightly from Q1 to record levels. But we've seen a pickup in orders for the Gulfstream G500 and G600 and 650 platforms, which is a good indicator for production trends on this business going forward.
Our structures business particularly within Commercial Aerospace is not only benefiting from the steps we've taken to increase asset utilization return on capital, but also from our investments as you know in core technologies and processes. 
For example, both our titanium operations in Parsons Kansas and [indiscernible] New York are building strong capabilities and operations efficiency for the future. This is a to point out as we're not only cost-cutting but also investing for stronger long-term value for both Ducommun customers and shareholders. 
In summary, I'm pleased the company is moving forward, and have developed a solid track record of results. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB accounting standards codification, or ASC topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on",984,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB accounting standards codification, or ASC topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results.
Please see the company's filings in today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy ASC 605. 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $154.8 million versus $140.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $16.1 million of higher sales to the company's Commercial Aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large fixed wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned.
Ducommun's backlog rose $823 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $820 million in Q1. 
And moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 20.7% in the second quarter versus 18.6% in the prior year's comparable period. This increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix as noted.
SG&A was $21.2 million for the second quarter versus $19.6 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs, and an increase in professional service fees, which included about $300,000 of acquisition costs for CTP in the second quarter.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue, versus operating income of $6.6 million or 4.7% of revenue in the prior-year period. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $8.8 million versus 5. -- excuse me, about 5.7% of sales, up 33% year-over-year. 
Our Q2 restructuring activities included approximately $3.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $0.7 million within our electronic systems, and $1.1 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equal to $5.4 million. 
As mentioned previously, by year end, we expect to be operating with about 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff as we work to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019.
Additional restructuring will take place during the rest of this year, and we expect to incur restructuring charges of about $5 million to $6 million in the second half of 2018, bringing the total program to $20 million to $22 million since we began Q4 of '17. 
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 million last year, primarily due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisitions of LDS and CTP along with higher interest rates. 
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017. 
Adjusted net income was $4.2 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the current year second quarter. And our tax rate was 13%. 
Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges going forward.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. 
Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $81.8 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $5.4 million of higher sales to our Commercial Aerospace customers, offset by some slight declines in shipments within our Industrial and military end markets. 
Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue versus $8.9 million or 10.9% of revenue in the prior-year period. 
Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the Electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the second quarter of 2018. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $70.3 million in the second quarter of 2018, versus $59.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $10.7 million of higher sales across our Commercial Aerospace applications, particularly, on the large jet single aisle platforms. 
Structural systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5 million or 7.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. 
Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, structure's adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the 2018 second quarter. 
As Steve discussed, while we're pleased with the improved performance that reflects our restructuring programs as well as the increased build rates, margins can vary quarter-to-quarter due to product mix and platform timing. We continue to focus on producing consistently better margins across our entire business enterprise. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A expense for the second quarter was $8.1 million or 5.2% of total company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.1% of revenue last year. 
The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to the $1.1 million restructured charge previously mentioned, increased compensation and benefits cost as well as higher professional service fees. 
Coming to liquidity and capital resources, we generated $15.9 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2018 versus $3 million in 2017. 
We also paid down $9.3 million of debt during the quarter and expect to pay off $25 million to $30 million in debt for 2018, absent any additional acquisitions. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.2 million during the second quarter. And we still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new programs wins. 
Once again, I'd like to reiterate that we are pleased by improving performance this year, which reflects the execution of a well thought out restructuring strategy, and the implementation of streamline initiatives across the company. Through careful planning and a passion to serve our customers, we are optimistic about continued higher returns in the quarter to come.

Those are getting exited out of the portfolio. So we've been fortunate with the increase in demand on the single aisle, particularly, that any of those revenues share gains that we've given back to the customers for the single out volume increases so that's probably the two biggest pieces that help us see the margin.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
Q2 performance is certainly a very good step forward for the company. The significant progress clearly shows the impact from many initiatives put in place since my arrival in January 2017 to enhance top line growth, expand margins and generally produce more consistent, positive financial results.
Revenue for the quarter rose nearly 10% year-over-year to $154.8 million as we benefited from strong demand across nearly every aspect of our business. It's great to see the benefits of our efforts as growth on key platforms and recent wins drive top line performance.
In addition, the strong focus on operational excellence, advanced technology and our 2 acquisitions are strengthening Ducommun's position as the unique provider of a broader array of electronic and structural applications for the aerospace and defense industry.
Ducommun grew margins nicely this quarter and as expected. The company's gross margin rose 210 basis points to 20.7% from 18.6% last year, reflecting higher volumes and improved mix. And our adjusted operating margin climbed 100 basis points to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2017.
Notably, and I'm pleased to tell you, our structure's adjusted operating margin, which has been a key focus for us since I arrived, rose sequentially 440 basis points, 10.2% this quarter from 5.8% in Q1 and 540 basis points from 4.8% in Q4.
I'm sure you'll agree that the progress is very encouraging and was helped by favorable product mix and increased volume.
We also took another $5.4 million of restructuring charges this quarter, on top of the $11 million previously booked, in connection with our various streamlining initiatives that cut across all facets of our organization.
We remain on track to eliminate roughly 16% of our forward space by year-end and reduce that by 6%, which will result in savings previously announced of about $14 million annual cost going forward.
We've already completed many of the efficiency improvements within our structures group, including excess capacity in California. And most of the remaining restructuring will target our electronic segment.
During the quarter, we announced the closure of our Phoenix,, Arizona plant, and we're moving that capability to our Huntsville, Arkansas facility by fiscal year-end.
I also want to take this time to recognize our Phoenix team for their professionalism. 
We ended the quarter, once again, with strong backlog of $823 million, leaving the company well positioned for growth and further performance improvement heading into 2019. 
In addition, we generated $15.9 million in cash from operations during the period, resulting in $26.2 million of cash flow year-to-date.
At the same time, our acquisitions of LDS and CTP are fully integrated, contributing financially and broadening Ducommun's technology portfolio.
Regarding our acquisitions, I'd also want to emphasize to investors that Fortune 100 executive-level talent is leading this important process and driving acquisition decisions. 
Overall, our team is keenly focused on taking the company to the next level in terms of operating excellence. I'm very positive about what we've had accomplished and where we stand on transformation of the company.
Now let me provide you some color on our end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we've posted second quarter revenue of $70.3 million, up slightly from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16 and F-18 programs as well as increased deliveries for certain missile and defense programs.
Please keep in mind that we are always -- also always reviewing and rationalizing poor-performing programs.
We anticipate continued growth across our key platforms going forward and expect strong [ by-products ] and support for defense spending on Capitol Hill as budget priorities are formulated from fiscal 2019.
Our military and space backlog grew as well to roughly $323 million during the quarter, up modestly from Q1.
Then our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose approximately 29% year-over-year to $71.8 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing aircraft applications, driven by high build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and Airbus A320 family.
As I mentioned earlier, these increased levels of production, combined with our restructuring measures and better operational performance, are generating benefit shown in margin expansion, typically within our structures group. We expect further operating leverage in the future as we continue our restructuring program, although quarter-over-quarter results can vary due to overall product mix.
Backlog within commercial aerospace remains solid at $460 million, down slightly from Q1's record levels. But we've seen a pickup in orders for the Gulfstream G500 and 600 and 650 platforms, which is a good indicator for production trends on this business going forward.
Our structures business, particularly within commercial aerospace, is not only benefiting from the steps we've taken to increase asset utilization return on capital but also from our investments, as you know, in core technologies and processes.
For example, both our titanium operations, in Parsons, Kansas and Coxsackie, New York, are building strong capabilities and operation's efficiency for the future. This is important to point out as we are not only cost-cutting but also investing for stronger, long-term value for both Ducommun customers and shareholders.
In summary, I'm pleased the company is moving forward and it has developed a solid track record of results.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,574206410,1523265,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2018",2018-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies",984,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results.
Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $154.8 million versus $140.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $16.1 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large, fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned.
Ducommun's backlog rose to $823 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $820 million in Q1.
And moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 20.7% in the second quarter versus 18.6% in the prior year's comparable period. This increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix as noted.
SG&A was $21.2 million for the second quarter versus $19.6 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in professional service fees, which included about $300,000 of acquisition cost for CTP in the second quarter.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue versus operating income of $6.6 million or 4.7% of revenue in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $8.8 million versus 5. -- excuse me, was about 5.7% of sales, up 33% year-over-year.
Our Q2 restructuring activities included approximately $3.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $0.7 million within Electronic Systems and $1.1 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled to $5.4 million.
As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with about 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff as we work to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019.
Additional restructuring will take place during the rest of this year, and we expect to incur restructuring charges of about $5 million to $6 million in the second half of 2018, bringing the total program to $20 million to $22 million since we began in Q4 of '17.
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 million last year, primarily due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisitions of LDS and CTP along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017.
Adjusted net income was $4.2 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the current year second quarter. And our tax rate was 13%.
Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges going forward.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results.
Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $81.8 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.4 million of higher sales to our commercial aerospace customers, offset by some slight declines in shipments within our industrial and military end markets.
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue versus $8.9 million or 10.9% of revenue in the prior year period.
Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the second quarter of 2018.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $70.3 million in the second quarter of 2018, versus $59.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $10.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly, on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms.
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5 million or 7.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 3.6% of revenue last year.
Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the 2018 second quarter.
As Steve discussed, while we're pleased with the improved performance that reflects our restructuring program as well as the increased build rates, margins can vary quarter-to-quarter due to product mix and platform timing. We continue to focus on producing consistently better margins across our entire business enterprise.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. CG&A expense for the second quarter was $8.1 million or 5.2% of total company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.1% of revenue last year.
The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to the $1.1 million restructured charge previously mentioned, increased compensation and benefits costs as well as higher professional service fees.
Coming to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.9 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2018 versus $3 million in 2017.
We also paid down $9.3 million of debt during the quarter and expect to pay off $25 million to $30 million in debt for 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.2 million during the second quarter. And we still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins.
Once again, I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased [ with ] our improving performance this year, which reflects the execution of a well-thought-out restructuring strategy and the implementation of streamlining initiatives across the company. Through careful planning and a passion to serve our customers, we're optimistic about continued higher returns in the quarters to come.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
Q2 performance is certainly a very good step forward for the company. The significant progress clearly shows the impact from many initiatives put in place since my arrival in January 2017 to enhance top line growth, expand margins and generally produce more consistent, positive financial results.
Revenue for the quarter rose nearly 10% year-over-year to $154.8 million as we benefited from strong demand across nearly every aspect of our business. It's great to see the benefits of our efforts as growth on key platforms and recent wins drive top line performance.
In addition, the strong focus on operational excellence, advanced technology and our 2 acquisitions are strengthening Ducommun's position as the unique provider of a broad array of electronic and structural applications for the aerospace and defense industry.
Ducommun grew margins nicely this quarter and as expected. The company's gross margin rose 210 basis points to 20.7% from 18.6% last year, reflecting higher volumes and improved mix. And our adjusted operating margin climbed 100 basis points to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2017.
Notably, and I'm pleased to tell you, our structure's adjusted operating margin, which has been a key focus for us since I arrived, rose sequentially 440 basis points, 10.2% this quarter from 5.8% in Q1 and 540 basis points from 4.8% in Q4.
I'm sure you'll agree that the progress is very encouraging and was helped by favorable product mix and increased volume.
We also took another $5.4 million of restructuring charges this quarter, on top of the $11 million previously booked, in connection with our various streamlining initiatives that cut across all facets of our organization.
We remain on track to eliminate roughly 16% of our forward space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, which will result in savings previously announced of about $14 million in annual cost going forward.
We've already completed many of the efficiency improvements within our structures group, including excess capacity in California. And most of the remaining restructuring will target our electronic segment.
During the quarter, we announced the closure of our Phoenix,, Arizona plant, and we're moving that capability to our Huntsville, Arkansas facility by fiscal year-end.
I also want to take this time to recognize our Phoenix team for their professionalism. 
We ended the quarter, once again, with strong backlog of $823 million, leaving the company well positioned for growth and further performance improvement heading into 2019. 
In addition, we generated $15.9 million in cash from operations during the period, resulting in $26.2 million of cash flow year-to-date.
At the same time, our acquisitions of LDS and CTP are fully integrated, contributing financially and broadening Ducommun's technology portfolio.
Regarding our acquisitions, I also want to emphasize to investors that Fortune 100 executive-level talent is leading this important process and driving acquisition decisions. 
Overall, our team is keenly focused on taking the company to the next level in terms of operating excellence. I'm very positive about what we've had accomplished and where we stand in our transformation of the company.
Now let me provide you some color on our end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we've posted second quarter revenue of $70.3 million, up slightly from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16 and F-18 programs as well as increased deliveries for certain missile and defense programs.
Please keep in mind that we are always -- also always reviewing and rationalizing poor-performing programs.
We anticipate continued growth across our key platforms going forward and expect strong by-products and support for defense spending on Capitol Hill as budget priorities are formulated for fiscal 2019.
Our military and space backlog grew as well to roughly $323 million during the quarter, up modestly from Q1.
Then our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose approximately 29% year-over-year to $71.8 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing aircraft applications, driven by high build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and Airbus A320 family.
As I mentioned earlier, these increased levels of production, combined with our restructuring measures and better operational performance, are generating benefit shown in margin expansion, typically within our structures group. We expect further operating leverage in the future as we continue our restructuring program, although quarter-over-quarter results can vary due to overall product mix.
Backlog within commercial aerospace remains solid at $460 million, down slightly from Q1's record levels. But we've seen a pickup in orders for the Gulfstream G500 and 600 and 650 platforms, which is a good indicator for production trends on this business going forward.
Our structures business, particularly within commercial aerospace, is not only benefiting from the steps we've taken to increase asset utilization return on capital but also from our investments, as you know, in core technologies and processes.
For example, both our titanium operations, in Parsons, Kansas and Coxsackie, New York, are building strong capabilities and operation's efficiency for the future. This is important to point out as we are not only cost-cutting but also investing for stronger, long-term value for both Ducommun customers and shareholders.
In summary, I'm pleased the company is moving forward and it has developed a solid track record of results.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results.
Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $154.8 million versus $140.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $16.1 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large, fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned.
Ducommun's backlog rose to $823 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $820 million in Q1.
And moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 20.7% in the second quarter versus 18.6% in the prior year's comparable period. This increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix as noted.
SG&A was $21.2 million for the second quarter versus $19.6 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in professional service fees, which included about $300,000 of acquisition cost for CTP in the second quarter.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue versus operating income of $6.6 million or 4.7% of revenue in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $8.8 million versus 5. -- excuse me, was about 5.7% of sales, up 33% year-over-year.
Our Q2 restructuring activities included approximately $3.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $0.7 million within Electronic Systems and $1.1 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled to $5.4 million.
As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with about 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff as we work to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019.
Additional restructuring will take place during the rest of this year, and we expect to incur restructuring charges of about $5 million to $6 million in the second half of 2018, bringing the total program to $20 million to $22 million since we began in Q4 of '17.
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 million last year, primarily due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisitions of LDS and CTP along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017.
Adjusted net income was $4.2 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the current year second quarter. And our tax rate was 13%.
Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges going forward.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results.
Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $81.8 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.4 million of higher sales to our commercial aerospace customers, offset by some slight declines in shipments within our industrial and military end markets.
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue versus $8.9 million or 10.9% of revenue in the prior year period.
Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the second quarter of 2018.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $70.3 million in the second quarter of 2018, versus $59.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $10.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly, on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms.
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5 million or 7.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 3.6% of revenue last year.
Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the 2018 second quarter.
As Steve discussed, while we're pleased with the improved performance that reflects our restructuring program as well as the increased build rates, margins can vary quarter-to-quarter due to product mix and platform timing. We continue to focus on producing consistently better margins across our entire business enterprise.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. CG&A expense for the second quarter was $8.1 million or 5.2% of total company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.1% of revenue last year.
The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to the $1.1 million restructure charge previously mentioned, increased compensation and benefits costs as well as higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.9 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2018 versus $3 million in 2017.
We also paid down $9.3 million of debt during the quarter and expect to pay off $25 million to $30 million in debt for 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.2 million during the second quarter. And we still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins.
Once again, I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with our improving performance this year, which reflects the execution of a well-thought-out restructuring strategy and the implementation of streamlining initiatives across the company. Through careful planning and a passion to serve our customers, we're optimistic about continued higher returns in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.
Q2 performance is certainly a very good step forward for the company. The significant progress clearly shows the impact from many initiatives put in place since my arrival in January 2017 to enhance top line growth, expand margins and generally produce more consistent, positive financial results.
Revenue for the quarter rose nearly 10% year-over-year to $154.8 million as we benefited from strong demand across nearly every aspect of our business. It's great to see the benefits of our efforts as growth on key platforms and recent wins drive top line performance.
In addition, the strong focus on operational excellence, advanced technology and our 2 acquisitions are strengthening Ducommun's position as the unique provider of a broad array of electronic and structural applications for the aerospace and defense industry.
Ducommun grew margins nicely this quarter and as expected. The company's gross margin rose 210 basis points to 20.7% from 18.6% last year, reflecting higher volumes and improved mix. And our adjusted operating margin climbed 100 basis points to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2017.
Notably, and I'm pleased to tell you, our structure's adjusted operating margin, which has been a key focus for us since I arrived, rose sequentially 440 basis points, 10.2% this quarter from 5.8% in Q1 and 540 basis points from 4.8% in Q4.
I'm sure you'll agree that the progress is very encouraging and was helped by favorable product mix and increased volume.
We also took another $5.4 million of restructuring charges this quarter, on top of the $11 million previously booked, in connection with our various streamlining initiatives that cut across all facets of our organization.
We remain on track to eliminate roughly 16% of our forward space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, which will result in savings previously announced of about $14 million in annual cost going forward.
We've already completed many of the efficiency improvements within our structures group, including excess capacity in California. And most of the remaining restructuring will target our electronic segment.
During the quarter, we announced the closure of our Phoenix,, Arizona plant, and we're moving that capability to our Huntsville, Arkansas facility by fiscal year-end.
I also want to take this time to recognize our Phoenix team for their professionalism. 
We ended the quarter, once again, with strong backlog of $823 million, leaving the company well positioned for growth and further performance improvement heading into 2019. 
In addition, we generated $15.9 million in cash from operations during the period, resulting in $26.2 million of cash flow year-to-date.
At the same time, our acquisitions of LDS and CTP are fully integrated, contributing financially and broadening Ducommun's technology portfolio.
Regarding our acquisitions, I also want to emphasize to investors that Fortune 100 executive-level talent is leading this important process and driving acquisition decisions. 
Overall, our team is keenly focused on taking the company to the next level in terms of operating excellence. I'm very positive about what we've had accomplished and where we stand in our transformation of the company.
Now let me provide you some color on our end markets, products and programs.
Beginning with our military and space sector, we've posted second quarter revenue of $70.3 million, up slightly from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16 and F-18 programs as well as increased deliveries for certain missile and defense programs.
Please keep in mind that we are always -- also always reviewing and rationalizing poor-performing programs.
We anticipate continued growth across our key platforms going forward and expect strong by-products and support for defense spending on Capitol Hill as budget priorities are formulated for fiscal 2019.
Our military and space backlog grew as well to roughly $323 million during the quarter, up modestly from Q1.
Then our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose approximately 29% year-over-year to $71.8 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing aircraft applications, driven by high build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and Airbus A320 family.
As I mentioned earlier, these increased levels of production, combined with our restructuring measures and better operational performance, are generating benefit shown in margin expansion, typically within our structures group. We expect further operating leverage in the future as we continue our restructuring program, although quarter-over-quarter results can vary due to overall product mix.
Backlog within commercial aerospace remains solid at $460 million, down slightly from Q1's record levels. But we've seen a pickup in orders for the Gulfstream G500 and 600 and 650 platforms, which is a good indicator for production trends on this business going forward.
Our structures business, particularly within commercial aerospace, is not only benefiting from the steps we've taken to increase asset utilization return on capital but also from our investments, as you know, in core technologies and processes.
For example, both our titanium operations, in Parsons, Kansas and Coxsackie, New York, are building strong capabilities and operation's efficiency for the future. This is important to point out as we are not only cost-cutting but also investing for stronger, long-term value for both Ducommun customers and shareholders.
In summary, I'm pleased the company is moving forward and it has developed a solid track record of results.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,574206410,1536534,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2018",2018-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies",982,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results.
Please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $154.8 million versus $140.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $16.1 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for large, fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned.
Ducommun's backlog rose to $823 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $820 million in Q1.
And moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 20.7% in the second quarter versus 18.6% in the prior year's comparable period. This increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix as noted.
SG&A was $21.2 million for the second quarter versus $19.6 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in professional service fees, which included about $300,000 of acquisition cost for CTP in the second quarter.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue versus operating income of $6.6 million or 4.7% of revenue in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $8.8 million versus 5. -- excuse me, was about 5.7% of sales, up 33% year-over-year.
Our Q2 restructuring activities included approximately $3.6 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $0.7 million within Electronic Systems and $1.1 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled to $5.4 million.
As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with about 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff as we work to eliminate approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019.
Additional restructuring will take place during the rest of this year, and we expect to incur restructuring charges of about $5 million to $6 million in the second half of 2018, bringing the total program to $20 million to $22 million since we began in Q4 of '17.
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 million last year, primarily due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facility for the acquisitions of LDS and CTP along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017.
Adjusted net income was $4.2 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the current year second quarter. And our tax rate was 13%.
Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges going forward.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results.
Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus $81.8 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.4 million of higher sales to our commercial aerospace customers, offset by some slight declines in shipments within our industrial and military end markets.
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue versus $8.9 million or 10.9% of revenue in the prior year period.
Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the second quarter of 2018.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $70.3 million in the second quarter of 2018, versus $59.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $10.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly, on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms.
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5 million or 7.1% of revenue compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 3.6% of revenue last year.
Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin was 10.2% for the 2018 second quarter.
As Steve discussed, while we're pleased with the improved performance that reflects our restructuring program as well as the increased build rates, margins can vary quarter-to-quarter due to product mix and platform timing. We continue to focus on producing consistently better margins across our entire business enterprise.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. CG&A expense for the second quarter was $8.1 million or 5.2% of total company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.1% of revenue last year.
The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to the $1.1 million restructure charge previously mentioned, increased compensation and benefits costs as well as higher professional service fees.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.9 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2018 versus $3 million in 2017.
We also paid down $9.3 million of debt during the quarter and expect to pay off $25 million to $30 million in debt for 2018, absent any additional acquisitions.
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.2 million during the second quarter. And we still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins.
Once again, I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with our improving performance this year, which reflects the execution of a well-thought-out restructuring strategy and the implementation of streamlining initiatives across the company. Through careful planning and a passion to serve our customers, we're optimistic about continued higher returns in the quarters to come.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent development of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
As for the second quarter in 2018, the third quarter again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of many actions we've taken over the past 18 months to improve Ducommun's growth trajectory and overall financial results. Effective restructuring strategy, record backlogs, new program wins and a leaner, more efficient organization is now starting to be realized in our financial performance. 
Revenue rose 15.3% year-over-year to $159.8 million. The double-digit growth reflects the continued strength across a number of programs, both commercial and defense-related, which Ducommun is benefiting from significant shifts set amount per platform and rising bill rates. The company as a provider of structural electronic components for many large narrow-body aircraft, and our share gains of this market is growing quarter-by-quarter. At the same time, we recently announced a $200 million long-term contract produced in the sale components using our new proprietary VersaCore Composite technology for a leading engine OEM. While we cannot name the customer for competitive reasons, the contract, which runs through 2029, is an excellent example of the company leveraging its manufacturing expertise, proprietary materials along with process technology and composites. Ducommun will complete this sale product design in 2019 and then begin full production in 2020. For background, the VersaCore Composite technology enables the manufacture of lightweight aircraft structures at much lower cost without compromising durability. 
We also, again, posted stronger gross margins this quarter of 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% last year. And our adjusted op margins rose 90 basis points to 6.2% from 5.3% in 2017. 
Our structures adjusted operating margin, which has been a major focus, climbed to 9.1% from 6% last year, an increase of 300 basis points or 50%. And this is due to many initiatives implemented to drastically improve our operating efficiency and capacity utilization. 
In addition, we booked $3.4 million of restructuring charges this past quarter, which Doug will review further in the moment. We remain on track to eliminate roughly 60% of our floorspace by year-end and reduced staff by 6%, resulting in annual savings of approximately $14 million starting in 2019.  We ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $780 million, still near record levels and reflecting strong orders of both commercial and defense-related platforms. We generated $7.2 million in cash from operations, which equates to roughly $33.4 million of cash flow year-to-date. Given the strength of our balance sheet, accelerating top line growth and improving margins, Ducommun is on track as we turn the corner on 2018.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $71.5 million, up over 10% from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 programs other military aircraft. In fact, sales to fixed wings defense platforms rose 35% year-over-year. As the rate performance and shows the enduring value of these planes and the integral content Ducommun provides such as radar acts and cockpit electronics. We anticipate continued strong revenue going forward based on the outlook for military spending this year and next. Our military and space backlog was just under $300 million at the end of the quarter, remaining near-record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year, $76.3 million. Once again, we saw significant growth across our large fixed wing aircraft applications, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are clearly benefiting from having a greater presence on these aircrafts and increasing demand for narrow-body platforms, in general. Our content per chipset is over 15% higher on the Boeing 737 Max than it was on the 737 NG while with Airbus, Ducommun's total sales are up 34% year-over-year, and our A320 business has more than doubled in the last 12 months. As mentioned in the past, Airbus became a new customer in 2016. We are now seeing the benefits of significant runway ahead. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at $442 million, down slightly from Q2 in recognition of order timing. We're confident that our position across such platforms will remain strong, driving continued higher revenue heading into 2019. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention 2 other important matters. First, we recently announced that Shirley Drazba joined Ducommun Board as an independent director. I'm delighted to have Shirley as part of our Ducommun team, and her appointment expands the number of directors to 8, several of whom are independent. In addition, Shirley will be a member of the company's new innovation committee, which is designed to oversee our ongoing forward activities in developing additional technologies for aerospace and defense customers. She also brings years of product innovation experience from leading positions at IDEX and Honeywell. And we're very happy to have a person of her expertise and background at Ducommun. 
I'd also like to remind our listeners that Ducommun will host its first ever Investor Day in New York this Friday morning, November 9. We've already heard from over 50 analysts, institutional investors, financial advisers, who plan to attend. We look forward to a productive day of presentations and meetings. Besides myself and Doug, we'll also have on attendance Dave Walnut, our Vice President of Electronics Engineered Products; Jerry Redondo, Senior Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Structures; and Suman Mookerji, Vice President of Strategy and M&A. We hope you can attend this important meeting. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB accounting standards computation or ASC topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings with the SEC in today's press release for further description of this computation versus the prior policy ASC 605. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million versus $138.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. This performance primary reflects $16.3 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $6.8 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. The increase in both these markets were due to higher shipments for fixed wing platforms such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Lockheed Martin F-16, F-35 and Boeing F-18, as Steve just mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog was about $780 million at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $823 million in Q2 just due to order timing. However, it remains at near-record levels. Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, lower manufacturing overhead cost and favorable product mix. 
SG&A was $21 million in the third quarter versus $18.7 million in 2017 with the increase primary reflecting higher compensation of benefit costs and professional service fees. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue versus operating income of $7.3 million or 5.3% of revenue in the prior year period. On adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $9.6 million or 6.2% of sales, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Our restructuring activities included approximately 1.6 of charges within the Structural Systems segment, $1.2 million with Electronic Systems and $0.6 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled to $3.4 million. As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff, eliminating approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total program to $21 million to $23 million since starting in Q4 of 2017. 
Interest expense was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $2.2 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facilities for recent acquisitions. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was $6.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the current quarter. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and as we head into 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 10.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. 
Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $79 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $6.7 million increase in sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $2 million higher shipments within the military and space market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 10.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the 2018 third quarter. 
The Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $59.7 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $9.6 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on the large jet single out platforms as well as $4.9 million of increased revenue within the military and space markets due to increased shipments on helicopter platforms. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.5 million or 5.9% of revenue last year.
Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, the structures adjusted margin was 9.1% for the third quarter compared to 6% last year, a 50% increase. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses for the third quarter, $6.2 million or 3.9% of total company revenue compared to $4.5 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, restructuring charges of $0.6 million and higher professional service fees of $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $7.2 million of cash for operations in the third quarter of 2018 versus $11.1 million in 2017. However, on a year-to-date basis, we've generated $33.4 million in cash from operations compared to $27.4 million in the prior year comparable period. We also paid down $2 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million. And we expect to pay off approximately $25 million for the full year. In terms of CapEx, we spent $5.3 million during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we spent $12.8 million compared to $24.6 million in the prior year. We still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins such as the ones Steve previously mentioned. We're pleased with our overall improved operating performance this year.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. A",978,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
As with the second quarter in 2018, the third quarter again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of many actions we've taken over the past 18 months to improve Ducommun's growth trajectory and overall financial results. Effective restructuring strategy, record backlogs, new program wins and a leaner, more efficient organization is now starting to be realized in our financial performance. 
Revenue rose 15.3% year-over-year to $159.8 million. The double-digit growth reflects the continued strength across a number of programs, both commercial and defense-related, which Ducommun is benefiting from a significant shipset amount per platform and rising bill rates. The company is also known as a lead provider of advanced structural and electronic components for many large, narrow-body aircraft, and our share gains to this market is growing quarter-by-quarter. 
At the same time, we recently announced a $200 million long-term contract producing nacelle components using our new proprietary VersaCore Composite technology for a leading engine OEM. While we cannot name the customer for competitive reasons, the contract, which runs through 2029, is an excellent example of the company leveraging its manufacturing expertise, proprietary materials along with process technology and composites. Ducommun will complete the nacelle product design in 2019 and then begin full production in 2020. For background, the VersaCore Composite technology enables the manufacture of lightweight aircraft structures at much lower cost without compromising durability. 
We also again posted stronger gross margins this quarter of 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% last year, and our adjusted op margins rose 90 basis points to 6.2% from 5.3% in 2017. Our structures adjusted operating margin, which has been a major focus, climbed to 9.1% from 6% last year, an increase of 300 basis points or 50%. And this is due to many initiatives implemented to drastically improve our operating efficiency and capacity utilization. 
In addition, we booked $3.4 million of restructuring charges this past quarter, which Doug will review further in a moment. We remain on track to eliminate roughly 60% of our floor space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, resulting in annual savings of approximately $14 million starting in 2019. We ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $780 million, still near record levels and reflecting strong orders of both commercial and defense-related platforms. We generated $7.2 million in cash from operations, which equates to roughly $33.4 million of cash flow year-to-date. Given the strength of our balance sheet, accelerating top line growth and improving margins, Ducommun is on track as we turn the corner on 2018.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $71.5 million, up over 10% from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 programs along with other military aircraft. In fact, sales to fixed-wing defense platforms rose 35% year-over-year. It's a great performance and shows the enduring value of these planes and the integral content Ducommun provides, such as radar racks and cockpit electronics. We anticipate continued strong revenue going forward based on the outlook for military spending this year and next. Our military and space backlog was just under $300 million at the end of the quarter, remaining near-record levels. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $76.3 million and once again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are clearly benefiting from having a greater presence on these aircrafts and increasing demand for narrow-body platforms in general. Our content per shipset is over 15% higher on the Boeing 737 Max than it was on the 737 NG. While with Airbus, Ducommun's total sales are up 34% year-over-year, and our A320 business has more than doubled in the last 12 months. As mentioned in the past, Airbus became a new customer in 2016, and we're now seeing the benefits of significant runway ahead. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at $442 million, down slightly from Q2 in recognition of order timing. We're confident that our position across such platforms will remain strong, driving continued higher revenue heading into 2019.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention 2 other important matters: First, we recently announced that Shirley Drazba joined Ducommun board as an independent director. I'm delighted to have Shirley as part of our Ducommun team, and her appointment expands the number of directors to 8, 7 of whom are independent. In addition, Shirley will be a member of the company's new Innovation Committee, which is designed to oversee our ongoing forward activities in developing additional technologies for aerospace and defense customers. She also brings years of product innovation experience from leading positions at IDEX and Honeywell, and we're very happy to have a person of her expertise and background at Ducommun.
I'd also like to remind our listeners that Ducommun will host its first ever Investor Day in New York this Friday morning, November 9. We've already heard from over 50 analysts, institutional investors, financial advisers who plan to attend. We look forward to a productive day of presentations and meetings. Besides myself and Doug, we'll also have in attendance, Dave Wilmot, our Vice President of Electronics and Engineered Products; Jerry Redondo, Senior Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Structures; and Suman Mookerji, Vice President of Strategy and M&A. We hope you can attend this important meeting. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings with the SEC in today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million versus $138.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. This performance primary reflects $16.3 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $6.8 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. The increase in both of these markets were due to higher shipments for fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Lockheed Martin F-16, F-35, and Boeing F-18, as Steve just mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog was about $780 million at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $823 million in Q2 just due to order timing. However, it remains at near-record levels. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, lower manufacturing overhead cost and favorable product mix. 
SG&A was $21 million in the third quarter versus $18.7 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and professional service fees. 
The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue versus operating income of $7.3 million or 5.3% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $9.6 million or 6.2% of sales, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Our restructuring activities included approximately $1.6 million of charges within the Structural Systems segment, $1.2 million within Electronic Systems and $0.6 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled $3.4 million. As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff, eliminating approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total program to $21 million to $23 million since starting in Q4 of 2017. 
Interest expense was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $2.2 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facilities for recent acquisitions.
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was $6.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the current quarter. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and as we head into 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 10.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $79 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $6.7 million increase in sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $2 million higher shipments within the military and space market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 10.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the 2018 third quarter. 
The Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $59.7 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $9.6 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms as well as $4.9 million of increased revenue within the military and space markets due to increased shipments on helicopter platforms. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.5 million or 5.9% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, the structures adjusted margin was 9.1% for the third quarter compared to 6% last year, a 50% increase. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $6.2 million or 3.9% of total company revenue, compared to $4.5 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, restructuring charges of $0.6 million and higher professional service fees of $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $7.2 million of cash for operations in the third quarter of 2018 versus $11.1 million in 2017. However, on a year-to-date basis, we've generated $33.4 million in cash from operations compared to $27.4 million in the prior year comparable period. We also paid down $2 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million, and we expect to pay off approximately $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $5.3 million during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we spent $12.8 million compared to $24.6 million in the prior year. We still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins, such as the ones Steve previously mentioned. 
We're pleased with our overall improved operating performance this year. Our restructuring plan is on track to be completed this year, and our results reflect our continued focus on operational excellence as well as strong top line growth, and we're optimistic of our continued higher returns in the quarters to come.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. A",978,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
As with the second quarter in 2018, the third quarter again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of many actions we've taken over the past 18 months to improve Ducommun's growth trajectory and overall financial results. Effective restructuring strategy, record backlogs, new program wins and a leaner, more efficient organization is now starting to be realized in our financial performance. 
Revenue rose 15.3% year-over-year to $159.8 million. The double-digit growth reflects the continued strength across a number of programs, both commercial and defense-related, which Ducommun is benefiting from a significant shipset amount per platform and rising bill rates. The company is also known as a lead provider of advanced structural and electronic components for many large, narrow-body aircraft, and our share gains to this market is growing quarter-by-quarter. 
At the same time, we recently announced a $200 million long-term contract producing nacelle components using our new proprietary VersaCore Composite technology for a leading engine OEM. While we cannot name the customer for competitive reasons, the contract, which runs through 2029, is an excellent example of the company leveraging its manufacturing expertise, proprietary materials along with process technology and composites. Ducommun will complete the nacelle product design in 2019 and then begin full production in 2020. For background, the VersaCore Composite technology enables the manufacture of lightweight aircraft structures at much lower cost without compromising durability. 
We also again posted stronger gross margins this quarter of 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% last year, and our adjusted op margins rose 90 basis points to 6.2% from 5.3% in 2017. Our structures adjusted operating margin, which has been a major focus, climbed to 9.1% from 6% last year, an increase of 300 basis points or 50%. And this is due to many initiatives implemented to drastically improve our operating efficiency and capacity utilization. 
In addition, we booked $3.4 million of restructuring charges this past quarter, which Doug will review further in a moment. We remain on track to eliminate roughly 60% of our floor space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, resulting in annual savings of approximately $14 million starting in 2019. We ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $780 million, still near record levels and reflecting strong orders of both commercial and defense-related platforms. We generated $7.2 million in cash from operations, which equates to roughly $33.4 million of cash flow year-to-date. Given the strength of our balance sheet, accelerating top line growth and improving margins, Ducommun is on track as we turn the corner on 2018.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $71.5 million, up over 10% from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 programs along with other military aircraft. In fact, sales to fixed-wing defense platforms rose 35% year-over-year. It's a great performance and shows the enduring value of these planes and the integral content Ducommun provides, such as radar racks and cockpit electronics. We anticipate continued strong revenue going forward based on the outlook for military spending this year and next. Our military and space backlog was just under $300 million at the end of the quarter, remaining near-record levels. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $76.3 million and once again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are clearly benefiting from having a greater presence on these aircrafts and increasing demand for narrow-body platforms in general. Our content per shipset is over 15% higher on the Boeing 737 Max than it was on the 737 NG. While with Airbus, Ducommun's total sales are up 34% year-over-year, and our A320 business has more than doubled in the last 12 months. As mentioned in the past, Airbus became a new customer in 2016, and we're now seeing the benefits of significant runway ahead. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at $442 million, down slightly from Q2 in recognition of order timing. We're confident that our position across such platforms will remain strong, driving continued higher revenue heading into 2019.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention 2 other important matters: First, we recently announced that Shirley Drazba joined Ducommun board as an independent director. I'm delighted to have Shirley as part of our Ducommun team, and her appointment expands the number of directors to 8, 7 of whom are independent. In addition, Shirley will be a member of the company's new Innovation Committee, which is designed to oversee our ongoing forward activities in developing additional technologies for aerospace and defense customers. She also brings years of product innovation experience from leading positions at IDEX and Honeywell, and we're very happy to have a person of her expertise and background at Ducommun.
I'd also like to remind our listeners that Ducommun will host its first ever Investor Day in New York this Friday morning, November 9. We've already heard from over 50 analysts, institutional investors, financial advisers who plan to attend. We look forward to a productive day of presentations and meetings. Besides myself and Doug, we'll also have in attendance, Dave Wilmot, our Vice President of Electronics and Engineered Products; Jerry Redondo, Senior Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Structures; and Suman Mookerji, Vice President of Strategy and M&A. We hope you can attend this important meeting. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings with the SEC in today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million versus $138.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. This performance primary reflects $16.3 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $6.8 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. The increase in both of these markets were due to higher shipments for fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Lockheed Martin F-16, F-35, and Boeing F-18, as Steve just mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog was about $780 million at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $823 million in Q2 just due to order timing. However, it remains at near-record levels. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, lower manufacturing overhead cost and favorable product mix. 
SG&A was $21 million in the third quarter versus $18.7 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and professional service fees. 
The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue versus operating income of $7.3 million or 5.3% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $9.6 million or 6.2% of sales, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Our restructuring activities included approximately $1.6 million of charges within the Structural Systems segment, $1.2 million within Electronic Systems and $0.6 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled $3.4 million. As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff, eliminating approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total program to $21 million to $23 million since starting in Q4 of 2017. 
Interest expense was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $2.2 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facilities for recent acquisitions.
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was $6.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the current quarter. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and as we head into 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 10.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $79 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $6.7 million increase in sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $2 million higher shipments within the military and space market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 10.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the 2018 third quarter. 
The Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $59.7 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $9.6 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms as well as $4.9 million of increased revenue within the military and space markets due to increased shipments on helicopter platforms. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.5 million or 5.9% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, the structures adjusted margin was 9.1% for the third quarter compared to 6% last year, a 50% increase. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $6.2 million or 3.9% of total company revenue, compared to $4.5 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, restructuring charges of $0.6 million and higher professional service fees of $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $7.2 million of cash for operations in the third quarter of 2018 versus $11.1 million in 2017. However, on a year-to-date basis, we've generated $33.4 million in cash from operations compared to $27.4 million in the prior year comparable period. We also paid down $2 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million, and we expect to pay off approximately $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $5.3 million during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we spent $12.8 million compared to $24.6 million in the prior year. We still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins, such as the ones Steve previously mentioned. 
We're pleased with our overall improved operating performance this year. Our restructuring plan is on track to be completed this year, and our results reflect our continued focus on operational excellence as well as strong top line growth, and we're optimistic of our continued higher returns in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. A",978,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
As with the second quarter in 2018, the third quarter again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of many actions we've taken over the past 18 months to improve Ducommun's growth trajectory and overall financial results. Effective restructuring strategy, record backlogs, new program wins and a leaner, more efficient organization is now starting to be realized in our financial performance. 
Revenue rose 15.3% year-over-year to $159.8 million. The double-digit growth reflects the continued strength across a number of programs, both commercial and defense-related, which Ducommun is benefiting from a significant shipset amount per platform and rising bill rates. The company is also known as a lead provider of advanced structural and electronic components for many large, narrow-body aircraft, and our share gains to this market is growing quarter-by-quarter. 
At the same time, we recently announced a $200 million long-term contract producing nacelle components using our new proprietary VersaCore Composite technology for a leading engine OEM. While we cannot name the customer for competitive reasons, the contract, which runs through 2029, is an excellent example of the company leveraging its manufacturing expertise, proprietary materials along with process technology and composites. Ducommun will complete the nacelle product design in 2019 and then begin full production in 2020. For background, the VersaCore Composite technology enables the manufacture of lightweight aircraft structures at much lower cost without compromising durability. 
We also again posted stronger gross margins this quarter of 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% last year, and our adjusted op margins rose 90 basis points to 6.2% from 5.3% in 2017. Our structures adjusted operating margin, which has been a major focus, climbed to 9.1% from 6% last year, an increase of 300 basis points or 50%. And this is due to many initiatives implemented to drastically improve our operating efficiency and capacity utilization. 
In addition, we booked $3.4 million of restructuring charges this past quarter, which Doug will review further in a moment. We remain on track to eliminate roughly 60% of our floor space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, resulting in annual savings of approximately $14 million starting in 2019. We ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $780 million, still near record levels and reflecting strong orders of both commercial and defense-related platforms. We generated $7.2 million in cash from operations, which equates to roughly $33.4 million of cash flow year-to-date. Given the strength of our balance sheet, accelerating top line growth and improving margins, Ducommun is on track as we turn the corner on 2018.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $71.5 million, up over 10% from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 programs along with other military aircraft. In fact, sales to fixed-wing defense platforms rose 35% year-over-year. It's a great performance and shows the enduring value of these planes and the integral content Ducommun provides, such as radar racks and cockpit electronics. We anticipate continued strong revenue going forward based on the outlook for military spending this year and next. Our military and space backlog was just under $300 million at the end of the quarter, remaining near-record levels. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $76.3 million we once again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are clearly benefiting from having a greater presence on these aircrafts and increasing demand for narrow-body platforms in general. Our content per shipset is over 15% higher on the Boeing 737 Max than it was on the 737 NG. While with Airbus, Ducommun's total sales are up 34% year-over-year, and our A320 business has more than doubled in the last 12 months. As mentioned in the past, Airbus became a new customer in 2016, and we're now seeing the benefits of significant runway ahead. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at $442 million, down slightly from Q2 in recognition of order timing. We're confident that our position across such platforms will remain strong, driving continued higher revenue heading into 2019.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention 2 other important matters: First, we recently announced that Shirley Drazba joined Ducommun board as an independent director. I'm delighted to have Shirley as part of our Ducommun team, and her appointment expands the number of directors to 8, 7 of whom are independent. In addition, Shirley will be a member of the company's new Innovation Committee, which is designed to oversee our ongoing forward activities in developing additional technologies for aerospace and defense customers. She also brings years of product innovation experience from leading positions at IDEX and Honeywell, and we're very happy to have a person of her expertise and background at Ducommun.
I'd also like to remind our listeners that Ducommun will host its first ever Investor Day in New York this Friday morning, November 9. We've already heard from over 50 analysts, institutional investors, financial advisers who plan to attend. We look forward to a productive day of presentations and meetings. Besides myself and Doug, we'll also have in attendance, Dave Wilmot, our Vice President of Electronics and Engineered Products; Jerry Redondo, Senior Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Structures; and Suman Mookerji, Vice President of Strategy and M&A. We hope you can attend this important meeting.

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on cu",1011,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings with the SEC in today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million versus $138.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. This performance primary reflects $16.3 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $6.8 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. The increase in both of these markets were due to higher shipments for fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Lockheed Martin F-16, F-35, and Boeing F-18, as Steve just mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog was about $780 million at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $823 million in Q2 just due to order timing. However, it remains at near-record levels. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, lower manufacturing overhead cost and favorable product mix. 
SG&A was $21 million in the third quarter versus $18.7 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and professional service fees. 
The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue versus operating income of $7.3 million or 5.3% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $9.6 million or 6.2% of sales, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Our restructuring activities included approximately $1.6 million of charges within the Structural Systems segment, $1.2 million within Electronic Systems and $0.6 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled $3.4 million. As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff, eliminating approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total program to $21 million to $23 million since starting in Q4 of 2017. 
Interest expense was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $2.2 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facilities for recent acquisitions.
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was $6.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the current quarter. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and as we head into 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 10.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $79 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $6.7 million increase in sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $2 million higher shipments within the military and space market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 10.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the 2018 third quarter. 
The Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $59.7 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $9.6 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms as well as $4.9 million of increased revenue within the military and space markets due to increased shipments on helicopter platforms. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.5 million or 5.9% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, the structures adjusted margin was 9.1% for the third quarter compared to 6% last year, a 50% increase. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $6.2 million or 3.9% of total company revenue, compared to $4.5 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, restructuring charges of $0.6 million and higher professional service fees of $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $7.2 million of cash for operations in the third quarter of 2018 versus $11.1 million in 2017. However, on a year-to-date basis, we've generated $33.4 million in cash from operations compared to $27.4 million in the prior year comparable period. We also paid down $2 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million, and we expect to pay off approximately $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $5.3 million during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we spent $12.8 million compared to $24.6 million in the prior year. We still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins, such as the ones Steve previously mentioned. 
We're pleased with our overall improved operating performance this year. Our restructuring plan is on track to be completed this year, and our results reflect our continued focus on operational excellence as well as strong top line growth, and we're optimistic of our continued higher returns in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. A",978,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
As with the second quarter in 2018, the third quarter again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of many actions we've taken over the past 18 months to improve Ducommun's growth trajectory and overall financial results. Effective restructuring strategy, record backlogs, new program wins and a leaner, more efficient organization is now starting to be realized in our financial performance. 
Revenue rose 15.3% year-over-year to $159.8 million. The double-digit growth reflects the continued strength across a number of programs, both commercial and defense-related, which Ducommun is benefiting from a significant shipset amount per platform and rising bill rates. The company is also known as a lead provider of advanced structural and electronic components for many large, narrow-body aircraft, and our share gains to this market is growing quarter-by-quarter. 
At the same time, we recently announced a $200 million long-term contract producing nacelle components using our new proprietary VersaCore Composite technology for a leading engine OEM. While we cannot name the customer for competitive reasons, the contract, which runs through 2029, is an excellent example of the company leveraging its manufacturing expertise, proprietary materials along with process technology and composites. Ducommun will complete the nacelle product design in 2019 and then begin full production in 2020. For background, the VersaCore Composite technology enables the manufacture of lightweight aircraft structures at much lower cost without compromising durability. 
We also again posted stronger gross margins this quarter of 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% last year, and our adjusted op margins rose 90 basis points to 6.2% from 5.3% in 2017. Our structures adjusted operating margin, which has been a major focus, climbed to 9.1% from 6% last year, an increase of 300 basis points or 50%. And this is due to many initiatives implemented to drastically improve our operating efficiency and capacity utilization. 
In addition, we booked $3.4 million of restructuring charges this past quarter, which Doug will review further in a moment. We remain on track to eliminate roughly 60% of our floor space by year-end and reduce staff by 6%, resulting in annual savings of approximately $14 million starting in 2019. We ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $780 million, still near record levels and reflecting strong orders of both commercial and defense-related platforms. We generated $7.2 million in cash from operations, which equates to roughly $33.4 million of cash flow year-to-date. Given the strength of our balance sheet, accelerating top line growth and improving margins, Ducommun is on track as we turn the corner on 2018.
Now let me provide you some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $71.5 million, up over 10% from last year, reflecting higher shipments for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 programs along with other military aircraft. In fact, sales to fixed-wing defense platforms rose 35% year-over-year. It's a great performance and shows the enduring value of these planes and the integral content Ducommun provides, such as radar racks and cockpit electronics. We anticipate continued strong revenue going forward based on the outlook for military spending this year and next. Our military and space backlog was just under $300 million at the end of the quarter, remaining near-record levels. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $76.3 million we once again saw significant growth across our large fixed-wing aircraft applications, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are clearly benefiting from having a greater presence on these aircrafts and increasing demand for narrow-body platforms in general. Our content per shipset is over 15% higher on the Boeing 737 Max than it was on the 737 NG. While with Airbus, Ducommun's total sales are up 34% year-over-year, and our A320 business has more than doubled in the last 12 months. As mentioned in the past, Airbus became a new customer in 2016, and we're now seeing the benefits of significant runway ahead. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at $442 million, down slightly from Q2 in recognition of order timing. We're confident that our position across such platforms will remain strong, driving continued higher revenue heading into 2019.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention 2 other important matters: First, we recently announced that Shirley Drazba joined Ducommun board as an independent director. I'm delighted to have Shirley as part of our Ducommun team, and her appointment expands the number of directors to 8, 7 of whom are independent. In addition, Shirley will be a member of the company's new Innovation Committee, which is designed to oversee our ongoing forward activities in developing additional technologies for aerospace and defense customers. She also brings years of product innovation experience from leading positions at IDEX and Honeywell, and we're very happy to have a person of her expertise and background at Ducommun.
I'd also like to remind our listeners that Ducommun will host its first ever Investor Day in New York this Friday morning, November 9. We've already heard from over 50 analysts, institutional investors, financial advisers who plan to attend. We look forward to a productive day of presentations and meetings. Besides myself and Doug, we'll also have in attendance, Dave Wilmot, our Vice President of Electronics and Engineered Products; Jerry Redondo, Senior Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Structures; and Suman Mookerji, Vice President of Strategy and M&A. We hope you can attend this important meeting. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC Topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings with the SEC in today's press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million versus $138.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. This performance primary reflects $16.3 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $6.8 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. The increase in both of these markets were due to higher shipments for fixed-wing platforms, such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Lockheed Martin F-16, F-35, and Boeing F-18, as Steve just mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog was about $780 million at the end of the quarter, down slightly from $823 million in Q2 just due to order timing. However, it remains at near-record levels. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.8% after purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606 versus 18.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, lower manufacturing overhead cost and favorable product mix. 
SG&A was $21 million in the third quarter versus $18.7 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs and professional service fees. 
The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue versus operating income of $7.3 million or 5.3% of revenue in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, operating income for 2018 was $9.6 million or 6.2% of sales, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Our restructuring activities included approximately $1.6 million of charges within the Structural Systems segment, $1.2 million within Electronic Systems and $0.6 million at the corporate level, which in aggregate equaled $3.4 million. As mentioned previously, by year-end, we expect to be operating with 16% less manufacturing square footage and 6% fewer staff, eliminating approximately $14 million in annualized expenses by 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total program to $21 million to $23 million since starting in Q4 of 2017. 
Interest expense was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $2.2 million last year due to higher utilization of our revolving credit facilities for recent acquisitions.
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was $6.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the current quarter. Our expected tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18% before any restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and as we head into 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 10.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $79 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $6.7 million increase in sales to our commercial aerospace customers and $2 million higher shipments within the military and space market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 10.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges, the impact of ASC 606, the electronics adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the 2018 third quarter. 
The Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus $59.7 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $9.6 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly on the large-jet, single-aisle platforms as well as $4.9 million of increased revenue within the military and space markets due to increased shipments on helicopter platforms. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to operating income of $3.5 million or 5.9% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of ASC 606, the structures adjusted margin was 9.1% for the third quarter compared to 6% last year, a 50% increase. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $6.2 million or 3.9% of total company revenue, compared to $4.5 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The higher CG&A expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, restructuring charges of $0.6 million and higher professional service fees of $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $7.2 million of cash for operations in the third quarter of 2018 versus $11.1 million in 2017. However, on a year-to-date basis, we've generated $33.4 million in cash from operations compared to $27.4 million in the prior year comparable period. We also paid down $2 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million, and we expect to pay off approximately $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $5.3 million during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we spent $12.8 million compared to $24.6 million in the prior year. We still anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2018 to support new program wins, such as the ones Steve previously mentioned. 
We're pleased with our overall improved operating performance this year.
