First, today, we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. 
Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year, and as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement travel revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas. 
Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers and successfully delivered our largest-ever new product launch. 
Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of [ $1.04, ] up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. 
Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. 
Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving 2 goals: First, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments. This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better position amidst of the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitment and our strategy is working. We made progress towards improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. 
Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized growth gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. This cost saving also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. 
Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of accounts receivable sales programs. While these actions have a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.
Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. 
I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths. Fuji Xerox is a leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and solutions and services. The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. 
Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnership in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. 
Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that comes with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains. The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities. By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers. For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed it this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. 
Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective.  We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which include our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. 
Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. 
At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program. To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7 to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount that to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.
Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive the greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader, with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness. We are projecting to deliver substantial cost saving for the combined company, totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions. Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the new 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital toward strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing components of this combination for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as twofold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company, with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. 
Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the 2 companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. 
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. 
Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost-saving and margin-expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. 
Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow return to shareholders. As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to pronounce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from the deep talent at both companies. The new company board would include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go-to-market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago, I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal was so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customers' demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. 
Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost-saving and margin-expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost saving expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident our company's ability to deliver these savings. 
I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide.  Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost saving, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be frontloaded with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. 
Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile with the greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan. As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership positions and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. 
On Slide 24, with 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and material technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly growing markets. Together, we will be well positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox."
103599,550260877,1377031,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination. As Jeff explained, the transact",747,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination. As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company, with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress towards improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. 
We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox's separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. This will impact the cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dissynergies associated with the transaction. Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS-accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. 
Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and to $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes of the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down the mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. 
As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generated capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.
The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credi profiled and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broad access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital returns to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain that current Xerox $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

So Xerox participated in about $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration of go-to-markets because the go-to-markets for the most part will take exactly as there. what I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies. One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now, we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well. That's the graphic card, data, labels, folding carton. That's still very much an analog market. That's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on nonpaper substrate, printing objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenues."

With regard to integration and access, one of the exciting areas, if you were to look at inkjet as an example, right now, we have separate strategies for Fuji Xerox and inkjet, Fuji film on inkjet, Xerox on inkjet. And you definitely know very well Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly inkjet capabilities as well and we'll be able to leverage those. When we talk about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all 3 companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about like Palo Alto Research Center will there's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, and then we have people on our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to. Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot. So for the next few months, we expect to close this transaction sometime in the second half, we can only do a lot of planning. And then hopefully, we'll hit the ground running upon the close."

We then double their share count, and that $5.5 billion by doubling the share count [indiscernible] 75% of Fuji Xerox and applying the $7.3 billion value.

And one of the things we will get the normal 4-, 5-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-branded expansion strategy, the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in. We also have about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multibrand resale partner there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices as with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they have been focused on multibrand resellers. And that's an area they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing this 2 companies together is comparing the best practices.

And Paul, on the second part of your question, actually, it's a very fair question and one that most people would think about. In this case, we actually have benefits of bringing 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though we're separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, so we actually make the same products. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like the common controller, so we won't have separate front-end. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see our territories [ to a year ] later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at the areas, the thing that really excites me because I've never run a manufacturing facility, I've run companies that have very been very intensive and supply chain and manufacturing, when we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price and that's very important. But if you go back to the last 3 years of Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and swept to the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations to sweat the assets and get right absorption, which is a really benefit of bringing doubt together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our r&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services deals to increase over win rates, best practicing shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer."

First, today, we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. 
Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year and, as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement to our revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas.
Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers, and successfully delivered our largest ever new product launch. 
Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of $1.04, up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. 
Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. 
Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving 2 goals: first, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments.
This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better positioned amidst the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We made progress toward improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. 
Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds, while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. These cost savings also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. 
Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of account receivables sales programs. While these actions had a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.
Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. 
I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths.
Fuji Xerox is a leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and solutions and services. 
The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. 
Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnerships in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. 
Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains.
The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions, and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities.
By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers.
For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. 
Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective. We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which include our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. 
Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. 
At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program.
To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7 to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount back to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.
Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive the greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness.
We are projecting to deliver substantial cost savings for the combined company totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions.
Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital towards strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing components of this combination for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as two-fold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth, while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. 
Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the 2 companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. 
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. 
Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost savings and margin expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. 
Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow return to shareholders.
As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to announce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from a deep talent at both companies. The new company board will include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox Board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand's strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go to market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal was so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customers' demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. 
Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost saving and margin expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion in annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident of our company's ability to deliver these savings. 
I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide. Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization, such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be front loaded, with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. 
Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile, with a greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan.
As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership positions and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. 
On Slide 24. With 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics, will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and materials technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly growing markets. Together, we will be well-positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox."

I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination.As Jeff explained, the transac",745,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination.
As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. 
We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. 
We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. These will impact cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dis-synergies associated with the transaction. 
Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. 
Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down a mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. 
As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generation capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.
The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credit profiled and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broader access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital returns to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain the current Xerox $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

So Shannon, this is -- the most exciting part of this is, as you said, it's the go-to-market and it's the innovation aspects. The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integrations, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox is participating in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration of go-to-markets because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies. One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now, we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on non-paper substrates, printing on objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenues."

So we just don't know, and we only know what we read at this point. With regard to integration and access, one of the exciting areas, if you were to look at inkjet as an example, right now, we have separate strategies for Fuji Xerox on inkjet, Fujifilm on inkjet, Xerox on inkjet. And you definitely know very well, Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly ink capabilities as well, and we'll be able to leverage those. When we talked about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all 3 companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about, like in Palo Alto Research Center, whether it's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning; and then we have people on our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to. Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot. So for the next few months, and we expect to close this transaction sometime in the second half, we can only do a lot of planning. And then hopefully, we'll hit the ground running upon the close."

So if you were to look at Xerox today, and let's just use the round figure about $8 billion market cap, and we deduct the dividend of $2.5 billion, let's value Xerox from that standpoint at $5.5 billion, we then double the share count; and that $5.5 billion, by doubling the share count, buys us 75% of Fuji Xerox, implying the $7.3 billion value. Now knowing the company and having worked with them as long as we have, we certainly view the intrinsic value is much more than $7.3 billion. So -- but it's really -- there are 3 factors: we normally get the equity income, we're doubling the shares and interest on the dividend."

So -- but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something we will get 4- or 5-quarter benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal 4- or 5-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in. We only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices.

And Paul, on the second part of your question, actually, it's a very fair question and one that most people would think about. In this case, we actually have benefits of bringing the 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though they were separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, so we actually make the same products. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like a common controller so we won't have separate front-ends. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see it in our territories [ until a year ] later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at areas, the thing that really excites me because -- well, I've never run a manufacturing facility. I've run companies that have very -- been very intense in supply chain and manufacturing. When we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price, and that's very important. But if you go back to the last 3 years at Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and sweat the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations, to sweat the assets, to get right absorption, which is a real benefit of bringing that together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our R&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services deals to increase our win rates, best practice in shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer."

If it was Xerox introducing the product, it was with great involvement from Fuji Xerox. So from that standpoint, I think it'll be relatively seamless compared to most integrations."

First, today we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. 
Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year and, as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement to our revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas.
Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers, and successfully delivered our largest ever new product launch. 
Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of $1.04, up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. 
Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. 
Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving 2 goals: first, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments.
This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better positioned amidst the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We made progress toward improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. 
Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds, while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. These cost savings also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. 
Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of account receivable sales programs. While these actions had a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.
Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. 
I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths.
Fuji Xerox is a leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and Solutions & Services. 
The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. 
Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnerships in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. 
Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains.
The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions, and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities.
By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers.
For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. 
Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective. We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which includes our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. 
Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. 
At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program.
To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount that to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.
Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness.
We are projecting to deliver substantial cost savings for the combined company totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions.
Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital towards strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing component of this combination for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as two-fold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth, while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. 
Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the 2 companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. 
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already-established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. 
Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost savings and margin expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. 
Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly-enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow returned to shareholders.
As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to announce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm, having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from a deep talent at both companies. The new company board will include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox Board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand's strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go to market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago, I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal is so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customer demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. 
Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost saving and margin expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion in annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies, as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident of our company's ability to deliver these savings. 
I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide. Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization, such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be front loaded, with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. 
Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile, with a greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan.
As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership position and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. 
On Slide 24. With 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics, will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and materials technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly-growing markets. Together, we will be well positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox."

I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination.
As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. 
We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. 
We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox's separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. These will impact cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dis-synergies associated with the transaction. 
Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. 
Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down a mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. 
As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generation capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.
The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credit profile and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broad access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital return to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain the current Xerox's $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

To conclude, today is a significant moment in the next chapter for our company and shareholders as well as the industry. The strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance we announced not only showed clear progress on our stand-alone strategic goals, but also provides positive momentum for the future and a solid foundation for the combination with Fuji Xerox.
We are energized by the opportunities inherent in taking our Fuji Xerox joint venture to the next level, combining 2 industry leaders in unlocking significant value while unleashing innovation for future revenue streams. The proposed transaction will create substantial value to Xerox shareholders through a combination of an immediate special cash dividend and the opportunity to realize value from the future growth of a significantly stronger combined company.
We are excited about the progress we have made at Xerox and the resulting performance improvement. While we work to finalize this transaction, we at Xerox remain committed to continuing our progress and further strengthening the company as we move into 2018. 
With that, I will hand it over to Jennifer."

So Shannon, this is -- the most exciting part of this is, as you said, it's the go-to-market and it's the innovation aspect. The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integration, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox participated in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration of go-to-market because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies. One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on non-paper substrates, printing on objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenue."

With regard to integration and access, one of the exciting areas, if you were to look at inkjet as an example, right now, we have separate strategies for Fuji Xerox on inkjet, Fujifilm on inkjet, Xerox on inkjet. And you definitely know very well, Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly ink capabilities as well, and we'll be able to leverage those. When we've talked about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all 3 companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about, like in Palo Alto Research Center, whether it's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning; and then we have people in our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to. Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot. So for the next few months, and we expect to close this transaction sometime in the second half, we can only do a lot of planning. And then hopefully, we'll hit the ground running upon the close."

So if you were to look at Xerox today, and let's just use a round figure about $8 billion market cap, and we deduct the dividend of $2.5 billion, let's value Xerox from that standpoint at $5.5 billion, we then double the share count; and that $5.5 billion, by doubling the share count, buys us 75% of Fuji Xerox, implying the $7.3 billion value. Now knowing the company and having worked with them as long as we have, we certainly view the intrinsic value as much more than $7.3 billion.

When we get to Q1, what you'll see is we were down about 5.7% at constant currency Q1 2017",286,"Yes. So Q4 was the first impact that you had seen.

Q2 2017, we're down 14.6% at constant currency. And then Q3, we were down again double digit. So -- but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something where you'll get 4-quarter or 5-quarter of benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal 4-quarter or 5-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in. We only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices. As I mentioned before, their market shares in Asia are much higher than our market share. We're going to adopt their best practices as well."

And as far as our adjusted operating profit margin, our 13% to 14% in the full year is due to seasonality that we expect to be slightly below the low end of that range, but are fully confident in being within the full year range of 13% to 14%. As far as adjusted EPS, historically, we gave -- well, we gave guidance for next year of $3.50 to $3.70, $3.60 being the midpoint.

And Paul, on the second part of your question, actually, it's a very fair question and one that most people would think about. In this case, we actually have benefit of bringing the 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though they were separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, but we actually make the same product. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like a common controller so we won't have separate front-ends. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see it in our territories til a year later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at areas, the thing that really excites me because -- while I've never run a manufacturing facility, I've run companies that had very -- been very intense in supply chain and manufacturing. When we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price, and that's very important. But if you go back to the last 3 years at Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and sweat the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations, to sweat the assets, to get the right absorption, which is a real benefit of bringing that together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our R&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services' deals to increase our win rates, best practice in shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer."

Our people know each incredibly well, and they've been doing this together for a long, long time.

If it was Xerox introducing the product, it was with great involvement from Fuji Xerox. So from that standpoint, I think it'll be relatively seamless compared to most integrations."

First, today we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. 
Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year and, as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement to our revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas.
Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers, and successfully delivered our largest ever new product launch. 
Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of $1.04, up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. 
Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. 
Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving 2 goals: first, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments.
This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better positioned amidst the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We made progress toward improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. 
Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds, while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. These cost savings also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. 
Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of account receivable sales programs. While these actions had a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.
Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. 
I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths.
Fuji Xerox is a leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and Solutions & Services. 
The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. 
Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnerships in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. 
Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains.
The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions, and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities.
By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers.
For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. 
Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective. We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which includes our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. 
Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. 
At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program.
To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount that to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.
Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness.
We are projecting to deliver substantial cost savings for the combined company totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions.
Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital towards strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing component of this combination for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as two-fold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth, while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. 
Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the 2 companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. 
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already-established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. 
Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost savings and margin expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. 
Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly-enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow returned to shareholders.
As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to announce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm, having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from a deep talent at both companies. The new company board will include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox Board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand's strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go to market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago, I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal is so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customer demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. 
Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost saving and margin expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion in annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies, as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident of our company's ability to deliver these savings. 
I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide. Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization, such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be front loaded, with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. 
Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile, with a greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan.
As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership position and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. 
On Slide 24. With 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics, will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and materials technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly-growing markets. Together, we will be well positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox."

I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination.As Jeff explained, the transac",745,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination.
As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. 
We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. 
We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox's separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. These will impact cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dis-synergies associated with the transaction. 
Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. 
Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down a mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. 
As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generation capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.
The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credit profile and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broad access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital return to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain the current Xerox's $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We are energized by the opportunities inherent in taking our Fuji Xerox joint venture to the next level, combining 2 industry leaders in unlocking significant value while unleashing innovation for future revenue streams. The proposed transaction will create substantial value to Xerox shareholders through a combination of an immediate special cash dividend and the opportunity to realize value from the future growth of a significantly stronger combined company.

So Shannon, this is -- the most exciting part of this is, as you said, it's the go-to-market and it's the innovation aspect. The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integration, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox participated in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration of go-to-market because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies. One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on non-paper substrates, printing on objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenue."

And you definitely know very well, Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly ink capabilities as well, and we'll be able to leverage those. When we've talked about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all 3 companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about, like in Palo Alto Research Center, whether it's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning; and then we have people in our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to. Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot.

Now knowing the company and having worked with them as long as we have, we certainly view the intrinsic value as much more than $7.3 billion.

Most of that $1.25 billion will flow right to the bottom line, okay? So the vast majority of the -- so I'd say on the $1.7 billion, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 80% will flow through the bottom line."

So if you remember at the last earnings call, we said we had some confidence, but we didn't want to get out too far ahead of ourselves. But based upon what we knew about our September equipment results, we had some confidence. The fact that, and I think the evidence is at constant currency, we grew our equipment sales revenue 1.5%, which was the first time since second quarter 2013 that the company has grown their equipment sale revenue line. So it's being very well-received. Our channel partners are growing to the tune of about 65 last year. And we're pleased with the trajectory and where things are moving."

Q2 2017, we're down 14.6% at constant currency. And then Q3, we were down again double digit. So -- but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something where you'll get 4-quarter or 5-quarter of benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal 4-quarter or 5-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in. We only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices. As I mentioned before, their market shares in Asia are much higher than our market share. We're going to adopt their best practices as well."

And as far as our adjusted operating profit margin, our 13% to 14% in the full year is due to seasonality that we expect to be slightly below the low end of that range, but are fully confident in being within the full year range of 13% to 14%. As far as adjusted EPS, historically, we gave -- well, we gave guidance for next year of $3.50 to $3.70, $3.60 being the midpoint.

In this case, we actually have benefit of bringing the 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though they were separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, but we actually make the same product. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like a common controller so we won't have separate front-ends. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see it in our territories until a year later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at areas, the thing that really excites me because -- while I've never run a manufacturing facility, I've run companies that had very -- been very intense in supply chain and manufacturing. When we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price, and that's very important. But if you go back to the last 3 years at Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and sweat the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations, to sweat the assets, to get the right absorption, which is a real benefit of bringing that together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our R&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services' deals to increase our win rates, best practice in shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer."

Our people know each incredibly well, and they've been doing this together for a long, long time. So instead of it truly being 2 separate companies that have never worked together, this is a case where if we introduce a product that came from Fuji Xerox in the past, it was with great involvement from the Xerox people and vice versa. If it was Xerox introducing the product, it was with great involvement from Fuji Xerox. So from that standpoint, I think it'll be relatively seamless compared to most integrations."

Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we",2539,"Good morning, and welcome to Xerox' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. 
Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we have set to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
I joined the company because I saw an opportunity to rebuild Xerox into a leading tech company. I've spent considerable time talking with customers, partners and employees. There is one common theme: they want us to succeed. We are an important and often critical component of our customers' and partners' work processes and their success. They recognize the quality and ease of use of our products and many have strong, personal relationships with our company. Channel partners work with us because of the breadth of our portfolio and because of the support we provide, such as the marketing and training tools and resources that help them grow their business. 
Our customers and partners expect Xerox to bring breakthrough solutions to the market more quickly to help them keep pace with continuously changing technology landscape, and we need to be easier to do business with. 
Xerox employees care deeply about our company. One of the first things I did as CEO was reach out to employees and ask them to share with me what they think of Xerox. What do we do well? And where do we need to improve? Their responses reaffirmed my assumption that the team has the knowledge and enthusiasm to transform this company, and they want change. They want to be part of a company that is growing, a company with a new way of working, a company they can be proud of. 
We have a portfolio of leading edge, feature-rich products and solutions that support the needs of our customers. In the office, we have ConnectKey technology that is powered by an embedded, secure, cloud-enabled workflow management software platform with artificial intelligence and real-time analytics that enables the same app-based flexibility on our products that app stores do on mobile phones. Software-based flexibility is a new paradigm for hardware, and we are leading our industry was ConnectKey. With the Xerox App Gallery, users can download apps to a ConnectKey device and make their work easier. There are apps with broad appeal, like those that scanned to a cloud-based repository and apps that are industry-specific, like the health care MFP app, which enables a HIPPA-compliant paper-to-digital content workflow. 
At the high end of the business, our focus is on helping our graphic communication customers be more profitable. In May, we launched the Iridesse Production Press. What is special about Iridesse is its ability to use clear and metallic silver and gold dry inks for print embellishments, a lucrative market for the commercial printers. By layering the inks, it can create images that are iridescent in one pass through the machine, eliminating multiple presses and processes, saving our customers both time and money. Demand for Iridesse has exceeded our plan.
Beyond products are our software and services. 
We are the leader in Managed Print Services. Industry analyst firm IDC noted it in their most recent report that we have been on the forefront of the industry when it comes to enabling workflow optimization. We are growing this business, expanding offerings for the channel, but growth remains in the low single digits. This tells me that we have more work to be done. 
Our software businesses are some of our best-kept secrets. They are small, but they have tremendous growth potential. For example, our DocuShare offering, think Dropbox, think box, is cloud-enabled and helps companies manage their digital content, one of the biggest challenges we all face. We will soon launch a series of solutions for our DocuShare flex cloud repository that will connect and allow the integration with applications such as Salesforce, Intuit and DigiSign. Such integrations will simplify business processes and enable automated workflow apps. XMPie is a second software business, and it provides customers with technology to transform their print business into omnichannel print and digital communication businesses. Just last week, we won an Intertech award for XMPie's circle PersonalEffect Edition. This automation software connects every stage of marketing campaign production.  
We need to take our software and services businesses to the next level. 
One of the first areas I recognize that we must take better advantage of is our innovation and high-tech portfolio. I conducted reviews in PARC and our operations in Webster, New York and was impressed by what I saw. We have valuable and differentiated offerings that are underutilized as well as some new technologies, work that's underway in our labs that has the potential to disrupt industries. And as we develop and deploy these technologies, we must think differently about business models. It is our role to be the system integrator and provider of the entire offering, or for some of these technologies, are we better off following the model of Intel in the PC industry and focus on high-value technology elements and sell them broadly across an industry? 
What I saw in our labs tells me that Xerox has the potential to go beyond our current core markets and achieve scale by providing a critical technology element for several high growth emerging areas where we do not participate today. While we may choose not to develop the product, we have the technology that will go into others' products. It could be inks and imaging systems for digital packaging. It could be printsets and materials for 3D printing. It could be low cost pollution or hazardous gas sensors to keep us and the environment safe. The exact path of these opportunities is hard to predict, but the opportunities are real. 
Another opportunity is in optimizing our business. To do that, we need to look at things differently. Xerox has been running cost takeout programs for years, but they have not been effective. The benefits are not flowing to the bottom line and as we saw this quarter, margin was down 130 basis points.
The processes and the systems we use are complex, as is our operating model. For example, there is a lack of clarity on decision authority and who is accountable for outcomes in our current mated organizational construct. Often, the result is management by committee and a painful decision-making process. We have over 1,000 IT systems that takes resources to manage all these systems and disparate data from various systems hampers the decision-making process. 
From order-entry to product install, to repair and billing, we need to redefine our supply chain, not only to meet customer requirements, but also increase our competitiveness. 
We will anchor the transformation of our business on improving how we serve our customers and partners, better differentiating our products, services, systems and resources based on the way they wanted to be served. 
The majority of our revenues are recurring, which drives the dynamic of a relatively stable cash flow over time. This cash flow gives us the room to invest in the business and more directly return cash to shareholders. 
We have not effectively deployed our capital. M&A has been minimal, and we've not done share repurchases in the recent past. It's important that we have a maniacal focus on maximizing cash flow, ensuring its strength well into the future.
From this assessment of the business, we can pivot to our priorities.
First, we have an opportunity to drive improvement in our type line by addressing how we go to market to. We need to take a strategic approach to customer engagement, to meet their evolving needs, both in how they choose to buy and the level of service necessary for their business. We are going to make sure that we have the right mix of direct, indirect and online or e-commerce channels to support our various clients. And we are going to work with our channel partners, whether they are agents, concessionaires, document technology partners, solution providers or velocity partners to create frictionless processes and quick response times. 
To make this happen, we need to optimize our operations, which is our second priority. This is more than just process optimization. We need to optimize the way we are organized, our product portfolio, our supply chain, our financial model. Xerox carries a legacy of a much larger business with processes, systems and resources beyond what are required or affordable today. We need to change the way we operate. 
In our supply chain, we need to think differently and holistically to eliminate costs while ensuring we get the right offering to the right customer at the right time. We will drive for greater efficiencies, reduced complexity and faster time-to-market to enable an integrated customer experience. 
As we improve our operations, we know that to be a tech company, we must re-energize our innovation engine and to revamp our innovation business model, to invest in our own capabilities as well as M&A to enable commercialization of technologies we create. We also need to pursue more partnerships to accelerate our competencies while still maintaining our core differentiation and IP for value capture. And finally, we will have a priority of always focusing on our cash flow and capital returns to generate shareholder value. 
I spoke earlier of how cash flow is a critical measure. We are looking at everything, all the pillars of working capital, to drive cash flow growth. 
And in terms of capital deployment, we are revitalizing our M&A engine, and we will deliver our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And today, we announced that Xerox Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and that the company will opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in 2018. This positive step forward is a strong endorsement of the company and represents an immediate action to deliver value to our investors. 
I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions I hear.
First, we are not conducting an auction process for the company. An auction is time-consuming and costly. If a potential buyer comes forward, it is the responsibility of the board to consider any proposal that could generate additional shareholder value. The team and I are committed to doing what's best for Xerox, and we are focused on strengthening the company. 
We've been asked if all the recent news, headlines and changes have negatively impacted our business. That's not something that is easily measurable, but I can tell you we are not here to give excuses. What we've realized is that our customers and partners want us to succeed. We have work to do to further simplify our operation, but we have a solid base to start from. And that is going to be our focus. We are not looking back. 
That's also why I'm not going to talk about Strategic Transformation program. We are taking a new comprehensive end-to-end approach to optimize our operation, drive sustainable cost-saving more directly to the bottom line and improve how we serve our clients and partners. 
The final 2 questions are related to Fuji Xerox. As you know, in June, I sent a letter to Fujifilm Chairman Komori in response to their lawsuit seeking to save the proposed merger of Fuji Xerox and Xerox. We are confident in our right to terminate the transaction and will defend ourselves through the legal process. The lawsuit was the first communication I received from Fujifilm or Fuji Xerox, and it was a surprising tactic from a company that is also our supplier. 
The letter to Fujifilm stated that we currently do not intend to renew our TA agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires in 2021. I want to clarify what that means. 
First, Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, and the TA establishes the technology and brand licensing relationships between the 2 companies. Not renewing the TA does not dissolve the joint venture. We have a 25% ownership position in Fuji Xerox that is governed by a separate joint enterprise contract. 
As I have said, we will do what is best for Xerox. This is true of the work that we are doing to improve our supply chain to be more competitive. This means we need to source products, parts and supplies from the best and most competitive suppliers. Fuji Xerox is one of our suppliers today providing 59% of our cost production, and we will continue to work with them in areas where they are competitive. We manufacture a portion of the remaining 41% ourselves and have high-quality suppliers for the rest. But we are rethinking the way we choose our suppliers. The company in the past has not seriously pursued other suppliers. But recently, we were successful in partnering with a supplier for a new product. 
Just because a supplier has had business with Xerox in the past does not guarantee future business. They will have to earn our business. With all of our suppliers, we execute comprehensive contracts for each product. And these contracts assure continuity of parts and supplies over the product's life. 
As for Fuji specifically, we have not seen any disruption in our supply chain. I am confident in the continuity of supply of Xerox' equipment parts and supply, and we have time to work changes in our supply chain to be more competitive and to better serve our customers and partners. 
At this point, we turn to the financial results.
Our second quarter results were mixed. Equipment revenue and cash flow were good, while margin was pressured. Total revenue declined 4% at constant currency. Within that, equipment revenue was better, up 0.9% or down 0.6% at constant currency. Both sale revenue was a disappointment, down 5%. There were a couple of one off factors that Bill will cover, but we need to deliver multiple quarters of better equipment performance to drive post sales revenue improvement. 
Profitability in the quarter was lower than expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter but declined 130 basis points year-over-year, as cost savings were not enough to offset the impacts of revenue declines and other factors. 
As a result, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06, reflecting the impact of the overall lower operating profit. 
Through the first half of the year, we generated $451 million of operating cash flow, which was above our expectation, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, with the restart of our share repurchase program, we plan to opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in shares in 2018. We are committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Return of cash flow to investors is an important and appropriate element of our capital allocation policy given our strong cash flow profile. And we are pleased to restart the program, especially at a time when we believe our shares are not trading at their underlying value. 
I would like to hand the presentation over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to review our financial performance in more detail."

Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency, while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds and diminishing benefit from",1959,"Thanks, John. I'll start with the review of the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency, while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds and diminishing benefit from the approximate 4% top line currency impact in Q1. 
As a John highlighted, we are not seeing the degree of turnaround in revenue that we believe should follow our recent significant product launches, and while equipment revenue market share improved 1 point year-over-year in Q1, the latest available share data, we need our market share to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and improve trends in post sale. I'll cover in more detail what we are seeing in revenue by geography and product area on the next slide.
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline came from the combination of insufficient productivity to offset revenue declines as well as a few quarter-specific headwinds. 
Gross margin of 39.9% was down 70 basis points in the quarter, driven in part by a less-profitable mix of revenues. From a stream perspective, we had a higher percentage of equipment versus post sale. And within equipment, we weighted toward lower-end product sales. Additionally, last year's results included positive impacts in post sale from a contract buyout and higher licensing revenue. 
Within SG&A, as forecasted last quarter, we were impacted by $13 million of accelerated depreciation related to a decision to consolidated facilities in Rochester. The combined Q1 and Q2 impact was $22 million. Going forward, it will save us about $13 million annually. 
We also had a $7 million impact from the write-off of an IT project, within delivery, that would seem to no longer have a sufficient return on invested capital due to changes we are making in the business. Absent these 2 factors, SG&A would have shown a reduction year-over-year of $22 million. 
Lastly, both R&D and equity income were essentially flat year-over-year, so did not impact margin.
Turning to the below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $14 million were $20 million better year-over-year, driven by a gain of $16 million associated with the sale of a noncore business asset. Adjusted tax rate of 26.7% was within our full year range of 24% to 27% and roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06 from the second quarter of 2017, driven by the lower operating profit.
On a GAAP basis, we had $0.42 of earnings per share, which was down $0.21 in the quarter, driven by $0.17 of transaction costs. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox; nonservice retirement-related costs; and amortization of intangible assets as well as the $58 million in transaction costs. 
Revenue continues to be a mixed picture. Overall, total revenue was down 4% in constant currency, which is modestly better than Q1 and full year 2017, driven by equipment revenue. One factor impacting revenue is higher declines in our OEM business, reflected under other revenue, which was down $31 million in the quarter and represented nearly half of actual currency revenue decline. As noted previously, the OEM business has a very concentrated set of customers, and we recently have been impacted by the change in strategy by our largest customer. We expect this headwind to be with us for the remainder of the year with an approximate negative 1 point impact on total revenue.
Turning to the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 1.8% versus down 2.8% in quarter 1 with continued growth in Global Imaging Systems, reflecting SMB business, as well as an improvement in U.S. enterprise and channels driven by equipment. 
International declined 3.9% versus 5.5% in quarter 1 at constant currency with the continued pattern of declines in Europe being partially offset by growth in developing markets. 
Our highest area of decline was in other, driven by the OEM business, as just highlighted. 
Looking at the revenue streams. Equipment sales revenue, or ESR, in the quarter was relatively flat at constant currency, reflecting improvement of the prior year weak equipment sales. From a product area perspective, we saw the following: entry equipment revenue grew 10.6% in constant currency with double-digit growth in both entry color and black and white products. This was a good recovery off the 11% decline last quarter and reflected good demand for new products. 
Mid-range equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 7.4% in constant currency and had a third quarter in a row of double-digit color install growth. We have started to see share gains after having lost share in mid-range prior to last year's product launch. It is important we maintain this positive momentum so we can rebuild our machines in field. 
Lastly, high end continues to be weaker, down 9.9% at constant currency, which was consistent with quarter 1. Although we saw a good reception for our recently launched Iridesse platform, we only had a partial quarter of benefit, and it was not enough to offset declines in other product segments, including iGen. 
Post sale declined 5% in constant currency, which was about 1 point worse than trend driven by the continuing dynamics of lower page volumes, reflecting equipment sales declines in prior quarters as well as an approximate negative 0.5 point impact from the lower licensing and prior year contract buyout I referenced earlier. Within post sale, we did see some improvement in supplies revenue, which comprised 13% of total revenue and grew outside of the OEM business. 
I'll wrap up revenue by highlighting the Managed Document Services grew this quarter, up 2.3%, driven specifically by growth in the SMB-focused Partner Print Services as well as from higher equipment sales.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. As stated, operating margins in the second quarter was 11.9%, an increase of 150 basis points from Q1, however, down 130 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.80, a decline of $0.06 year-over-year. 
As highlighted earlier, there were a few unique onetime items we are calling out as we think it is helpful to talk separately to the more operational performance and then to the truly unique items. 
We believe our operational performance drove an adjusted operating margin of 12.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. This reflects a decline year-over-year of 50 basis points to margin and $0.049 to EPS, driven by the impact of revenue declines, which includes ongoing price declines of an approximate 5% on equipment and low single digits on post sale, as well as a less favorable margin mix of revenues, as described earlier. These factors were only partially offset by the positive impact of cost-savings and currency. 
In terms of unique onetime items in the quarter, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: $13 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the consolidation of real estate in Rochester, this had a 52 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.036 impact to EPS. As of June 30, this accelerated depreciation has been fully recognized.
In addition, there was a $7 million IT project write-off which had a 28 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.019 impact to EPS. 
Partially offsetting these impacts was a noncore asset sale of $16 million. This came through other expenses net so had no impact on margin, but was a boost to EPS of $0.044. 
For the second half of the year, we are not giving specific guidance on margin as we continue to build out the plan to support the priorities John highlighted. That said, it is correct to take away from our discussion that the focus on improving profitability is very high, and we expect higher margins from this business over time.
Operating cash flow was a source of $235 million in the quarter, and we are at $451 million through the first half. While free cash flow was a source of $203 million in Q2 and $401 million for the half. Cash flow is priority 1 to the business, and I'd like to take a minute to cover our results through 6 months. 
Working capital has been a use of $93 million [ through ] 6 months driven by timing of payments and includes $38 million of transaction and related payments. A great emphasis is being placed on improving all the cash conversion cycle pillars to drive even greater cash efficiency. 
Finance receivables have been a source of $149 million through 6 months, which compares to $167 million for the same period last year. Typically, finance receivables are a higher source in the first half given the seasonality of revenues, but this is an area where we would trade in being less of a source for higher equipment sales.
Pension contributions are $75 million through 6 months, while restructuring payments are $91 million. Our guidance was for $200 million for the full year for each of these areas. Pension contributions are running under that amount, so there could be an opportunity to do better there, while restructuring payments will likely not be an opportunity given the greater focus on productivity. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $32 million and is at $50 million through 6 months. This is an area where we are placing greater scrutiny and could be an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. 
In summary, the first half cash flow performance puts us well on track to maintain our full year expectations for both operating cash flow and free cash flow. 
If we turn to the next slide, I will finish by speaking to our capital structure. The second quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $265 million through the repayment of the May 2018 senior notes. We break down debt between financing and core by first calculating the finance debt by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our financing assets, finance receivables and other equipment on operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business. In Q2, this calculation resulted in an assumed financing debt of $3.5 billion and core debt of $1.7 billion. 
As the debt letters shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which by design do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well-positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
Before turning it back to John, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about guidance. As you just heard from John, we are confident in our business as demonstrated by our reiteration of our cash flow guidance and the resumption of our share repurchase program. We will be driving improvement in all financial measures, and with 75% of our business recurring in nature, we expect results will follow recent trends. However, we want to be sure we are making decisions for longer-term sustainability and, hence, won't be giving specific near-term guidance, think balance of the year, outside of cash flow. We will be providing additional details on financial expectations for the business during an Analyst Day in late 2018 or early 2019. 
I'll now turn it back to John for some concluding comments."

If you think of -- if I look at the initial perspective on the business, I see tremendous opportunity and we'll focus on the priorities we've discussed. But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it on an operational way. Let me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end, from the manufacturing what the costs are to the development of it, to what's the value to the client and how do you maintain it and how you ship it. And something as simple as, if you can manufacture and ship a box under GBP 45, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having 2 people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently. Today, as an example, we have 1,400 IP applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution?

To reiterate a few of my comments, on prepared comments. We are very confident in the business. We think that the share repurchase is a clear indication of that confidence in the business and that we believe that our current stock price does not reflect its true value of the company. We are driving for improvement on all measures, not just the cash flow measure. And as you know, 75% of our revenues are recurring in nature, and thus you wouldn't expect our results to differ significantly from recent trends overall. And specifically, I understand we're early in the new leadership here at Xerox, and we are specifically looking at all things. And we're making decisions for the longer term on sustainability. But our overall commitment is to do what's best for Xerox and that won't be measured by the next 3 to 6 months of an adjusted EPS number. With that said, we do believe that the cash flow guidance does provide some guide rails as far as overall expectations on where we'd be for the rest of the year. A few things to think about when you look back last year's results, you obviously Q4 will be a tougher compare versus Q3. There were some onetime items, you can go back to specifically looking what we reported last year in Q3 and Q4, which is calling out like a headwind in Q3 would be -- there was a Grenoble technology sale that created about a $0.09 headwind. There was a lower tax rate during Q3 of last year, to just tax reserve adjustment that took place. But overall, when you look at the just seasonality of the business still true, no matter what, Q3 tends to have lower operating margins than Q4. And then I guess [indiscernible]. Finally, on share repurchase, you can model through the impact, but we don't expect much of an impact in Q1. It could be up to $0.05 or so potentially, depending if you go to the higher end of the range of the up to $500 million in Q4. Those are sort of things, at a higher level to give some context on year-over-year thinking."

Yes, regarding if you're looking at signings in the quarter being down, and the signings down 20.6%, just breaking that down a little bit more detail. New business signings, which are really the signings are important, but new business signings were actually up 2% during the quarter. Renewals, somewhat can be lumpy in nature, depending on what is the opportunity and what's available. And actually the amount that came up for renewal during the quarter had a fair amount of impact. There was just less coming up in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. But renewals were down, and part of that was also due to the win rate percentage was clearly lower than our targeted 90% plus win rate and lower than our prior year win rate. We were at about year 75%. But really that was driven by 2 larger enterprise deals and so likes lumpiness, and there's also just large deals can drive that percentage from quarter-to-quarter. And clearly, you look at it, yes, we are striving to do well in all parts of the market. But clearly, we are also very pleased with what's happening in the SMB side of the signings area, where we don't get as quite as much detailed information, because we are dealing with partners a lot, but the end results, when you look at what's happening in the MPS, we feel good about that."

But how do you take other products, whether it's a new technologies that you are -- that you have in your innovation. Those are some of the best kept secrets out there in the industry. So as recently as a few days ago, I spoke to a very high-level executive of a financial organization and just took them through some of the offerings we have over and above what we offer today, the MBF, the service there. And we are going to do an Innovation Day with their team. This is in a competitive environment, so it's a non-Xerox account. And they want to see you, because most of our clients are asking us, tell us what we don't know. You have these great products, but what else do you have? And that's where I got excited when asked, hey, John, what's different when I got here? That's one of the area that's different, that our innovation assets are much better than I even assumed when I was looking at it. But how do we get it to market faster? And that's part of getting it to market faster is not just what we have today, but a lot more. How do we capitalize on that? We have tremendous assets like DocuShare, whether it's XMPie.

There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming on board that there has been even more. John's comments maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that. We are comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided recently and that we are reiterating that provided recently in January. As far as working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, day sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we are working to improve all of those significantly even though we had originally planned that just that the need to actually -- those will make it even better, I guess is what I would view it from a cash flows perspective that you look at where we are at year-to-date on cash flows, we are already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest that improvements in working capital, additional improvements, will only help us -- give us upside. It's really my perspective on that. From an MPS perspective, don't like to start going through the month. As we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months within a quarter. With that said, overall, MPS was up 2.3%. MPS revenues, 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MPS. The channels are the SMB part of the business continues to be strong, growing double digit, [indiscernible] at 14.4%. And MPS revenues and enterprise, still continue contributing yes, more competitive, more mature market, was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MPS, and we expect to continue to be that. The 2 larger deals we lost during the quarter, we are not happy about, but overall, for the longer term, we're still expecting to be strong in MPS."

Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we have set to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
I joined the company because I saw an opportunity to rebuild Xerox into a leading tech company. I've spent considerable time talking with customers, partners and employees. There is one common theme: they want us to succeed. We are an important and often critical component of our customers' and partners' work processes and their success. They recognize the quality and ease of use of our products and many have strong, personal relationships with our company. Channel partners work with us because of the breadth of our portfolio and because of the support we provide, such as the marketing and training tools and resources that help them grow their business. Our customers and partners expect Xerox to bring breakthrough solutions to the market more quickly to help them keep pace with continuously changing technology landscape, and we need to be easier to do business with. Xerox employees care deeply about our company. One of the first things I did as CEO was reach out to employees and ask them to share with me what they think of Xerox. What do we do well? And where do we need to improve? Their responses reaffirmed my assumption that the team has the knowledge and enthusiasm to transform this company, and they want change. They want to be part of a company that is growing, a company with a new way of working, a company they can be proud of. 
We have a portfolio of leading-edge, feature-rich products and solutions that support the needs of our customers. In the office, we have ConnectKey technology that is powered by an embedded, secure, cloud-enabled workflow management software platform with artificial intelligence and real-time analytics that enables the same app-based flexibility on our products that app stores do on mobile phones. Software-based flexibility is the new paradigm for hardware, and we are leading our industry with ConnectKey. With the Xerox App Gallery, users can download apps to a ConnectKey device and make their work easier. There are apps with broad appeal, like those that scan to a cloud-based repository and apps that are industry-specific, like the health care MFP app, which enables the HIPPA-compliant paper-to-digital content workflow. 
At the high end of the business, our focus is on helping our graphic communication customers be more profitable. In May, we launched the Iridesse Production Press. What is special about Iridesse is its ability to use clear and metallic silver and gold dry inks for print embellishments, a lucrative market for commercial printers. By layering the inks, it can create images that are iridescent in one pass through the machine, eliminating multiple presses and processes, saving our customers both time and money. Demand for Iridesse has exceeded our plan.
Beyond products are our software and services. We are a leader in managed print services. Industry analyst firms, IDC, noted in their most recent report that we have been at the forefront of the industry when it comes to enabling workflow optimization. We are growing this business, expanding offerings for the channel, but growth remains in the low single digits. This tells me that we have more work to be done. 
Our software business are some of our best-kept secrets. They are small, but they have tremendous growth potential. For example, our DocuShare offering, think Dropbox, think Box, is a cloud-enabled and helps companies manage their digital content, one of the biggest challenges we all face. We will soon launch a series of solutions for our DocuShare Flex cloud repository that will connect and allow the integration with applications, such as Salesforce, Intuit and DigiSign. Such integrations will simplify business processes and enable automated workflow apps. XMPie is a second software business, and it provides customers with technology to transform their print business into omnichannel print and digital communication businesses. Just last week, we won an InterTec award for XMPie's Circle PersonalEffect Edition. This automation software connects every stage of marketing campaign production. We need to take our software and services businesses to the next level. 
One of the first areas I recognize that we must take better advantage of is our innovation in high-tech portfolio. I conducted reviews in PARC in our operations in Webster, New York and was impressed by what I saw. We have valuable and differentiated offerings that are underutilized as well as some new technologies, work that's underway in our labs that has the potential to disrupt industries. And as we develop and deploy these technologies, we must think differently about business models. Is our role to be the system integrator and provider of the entire offering? Or for some of these technologies, are we better off following the model of Intel in the PC industry and focus on high-value technology elements and sell them broadly across an industry? What I saw in our labs tells me that Xerox has the potential to go beyond our current core markets and achieve scale by providing a critical technology element for several high-growth emerging areas where we do not participate today. While we may choose not to develop the product, we have technology that will go into others' products: it could be inks and imaging systems for digital packaging, it could be printheads and materials for 3D printing, it could be low-cost pollution or hazardous gas sensors to keep us and the environment safe. The exact path of these opportunities is hard to predict, but the opportunities are real. 
Another opportunity is in optimizing our business. To do that, we need to look at things differently. Xerox has been running cost takeout programs for years, but they have not been effective. The benefits are not flowing to the bottom line. And as we saw this quarter, margin was down 130 basis points. The processes and the systems we use are complex, as is our operating model. For example, there's a lack of clarity on decision authority and who is accountable for outcomes in our current matrix organizational construct. Often, the result is management by committee and a painful decision-making process. We have over 1,000 IT systems. It takes resources to manage all these systems and disparate data from various systems hampers the decision-making process. From order entry to product install, to repair and billing, we need to redefine our supply chain not only to meet customer requirements, but also increase our competitiveness. We will anchor the transformation of our business on improving how we serve our customers and partners, better differentiating our products, services, systems and resources based on the way they want to be served. 
The majority of our revenues are recurring, which drives the dynamic of a relatively stable cash flow over time. This cash flow gives us the room to invest in the business and more directly return cash to shareholders. We have not effectively deployed our capital. M&A has been minimal, and we've not done share repurchases in the recent past. It's important that we have a maniacal focus on maximizing cash flow, ensuring its strength well into the future.
From this assessment of the business, we can pivot to our priorities. First, we have an opportunity to drive improvement in our top line by addressing how we go to market. We need to take a strategic approach to customer engagement, to meet their evolving needs, both in how they choose to buy and the level of service necessary for their business. We're going to make sure that we have the right mix of direct, indirect and online or e-commerce channels to support our various clients. And we're going to work with our channel partners, whether they are agents, concessionaires, document technology partners, solution providers or velocity partners to create frictionless processes and quick response times. To make this happen, we need to optimize our operations, which is our second priority. This is more than just process optimization. We need to optimize the way we are organized, our product portfolio, our supply chain, our financial model. 
Xerox carries the legacy of a much larger business with processes, systems and resources beyond what are required or affordable today. We need to change the way we operate. In our supply chain, we need to think differently and holistically to eliminate costs while ensuring we get the right offering to the right customer at the right time. We will drive for greater efficiencies, reduced complexity and faster time-to-market to enable an integrated customer experience. 
As we improve our operations, we know that to be a tech company, we must reenergize our innovation engine and to revamp our innovation business model, to invest in our own capabilities as well as M&A to enable commercialization of technologies we create. We also need to pursue more partnerships to accelerate our competencies while still maintaining our core differentiation in IP for value capture. And finally, we will have a priority of always focusing on our cash flow and capital returns to generate shareholder value. 
I spoke earlier how cash flow is a critical measure. We are looking at everything, all the pillars of working capital to drive cash flow growth. And in terms of capital deployment, we are revitalizing our M&A engine, and we'll deliver our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders. And today, we announced that Xerox Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and that the company will opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in 2018. This positive step forward is a strong endorsement of the company and represents an immediate action to deliver value to our investors. 
I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions I hear. First, we are not conducting an auction process for the company. An auction is time-consuming and costly. If a potential buyer comes forward, it is the responsibility of the board to consider any proposal that could generate additional shareholder value. The team and I are committed to doing what's best for Xerox, and we are focused on strengthening the company. We've been asked if all the recent news, headlines and changes have negatively impacted our business. That's not something that is easily measurable, but I can tell you we're not here to give excuses. What we've realized is that our customers and partners want us to succeed. We have work to do to further simplify our operation, but we have a solid base to start from. And that is going to be our focus. We're not looking back. That's also why I'm not going to talk about Strategic Transformation program. We are taking a new comprehensive end-to-end approach to optimize our operations, drive sustainable cost saving more directly to the bottom line and improve how we serve our clients and partners. 
The final 2 questions are related to Fuji Xerox. As you know, in June, I sent a letter to Fujifilm Chairman, Komori, in response to their lawsuit seeking to save the proposed merger of Fuji Xerox and Xerox. We are confident in our right to terminate the transaction and we'll defend ourselves through the legal process. The lawsuit was the first communication I received from Fujifilm or Fuji Xerox, and it was a surprising tactic from a company that is also our supplier. 
The letter to Fujifilm stated that we currently do not intend to renew our TA agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires in 2021. I want to clarify what that means. First, Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, and the TA establishes the technology and brand licensing relationships between the 2 companies. Not renewing the TA does not dissolve the joint venture. We have a 25% ownership position in Fuji Xerox that is governed by a separate joint enterprise contract. 
As I have said, we will do what is best for Xerox. This is true of the work that we are doing to improve our supply chain to be more competitive. This means we need to source products, parts and supplies from the best and most competitive suppliers. Fuji Xerox is one of our suppliers today providing 59% of our cost production, and we will continue to work with them in areas where they are competitive. We manufacture a portion of the remaining 41% ourselves and have high-quality suppliers for the rest. But we are rethinking the way we choose our suppliers. The company in the past has not seriously pursued other suppliers. But recently, we were successful in partnering with a supplier for a new product. Just because a supplier has had business with Xerox in the past does not guarantee future business. They will have to earn our business. With all of our suppliers, we execute comprehensive contracts for each product. And these contracts assure continuity of parts and supplies over the product's life. As for Fuji specifically, we have not seen any disruption in our supply chain. I am confident in the continuity of supply of Xerox equipment parts and supplies, and we have time to work changes in our supply chain to be more competitive and to better serve our customers and partners. 
At this point, we turn to the financial results. Our second quarter results were mixed. Equipment revenue and cash flow were good while margin was pressured. Total revenue declined 4% at constant currency. Within that, equipment revenue was better, up 0.9% or down 0.6% at constant currency. Post sale revenue was a disappointment, down 5%. There were a couple of one-off factors that Bill will cover, but we need to deliver multiple quarters of better equipment performance to drive post sales revenue improvement. 
Profitability in the quarter was lower than expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter, but declined 130 basis points year-over-year as cost savings were not enough to offset the impacts of revenue declines and other factors. As a result, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06, reflecting the impact of the overall lower operating profit. 
Through the first half of the year, we generated $451 million of operating cash flow, which was above our expectation, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, with the restart of our share repurchase program, we plan to opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in shares in 2018. We are committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Return of cash flow to investors is an important and appropriate element of our capital allocation policy given our strong cash flow profile. And we are pleased to restart the program, especially at a time when we believe our shares are not trading at their underlying value. 
I'd like to hand the presentation over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to review our financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with the review of the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds, a diminishing benefit from the approximate 4% top line currency impact in Q1. 
As John highlighted, we are not seeing the degree of turnaround in revenue that we believe should follow our recent significant product launches. And while equipment revenue market share improved 1 point year-over-year in Q1, the latest available share data, we need our market share to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and improve trends in post sale. I'll cover in more detail what we're seeing in revenue by geography and product area on the next slide.
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline came from the combination of insufficient productivity to offset revenue declines as well as a few quarter-specific headwinds. Gross margin of 39.9% was down 70 basis points in the quarter, driven in part by a less profitable mix of revenues. From a stream perspective, we had a higher percentage of equipment versus post sale. And within equipment, we weighted toward lower-end product sales. Additionally, last year's results included positive impacts in post sale from a contract buyout and higher licensing revenue. 
Within SG&A, as forecasted last quarter, we were impacted by $13 million of accelerated depreciation related to a decision to consolidate facilities in Rochester. The combined Q1 and Q2 impact was $22 million. Going forward, it will save us about $13 million annually. We also had a $7 million impact from the write-off of an IT project, within delivery, that would seem to no longer have a sufficient return on invested capital due to changes we are making in the business. Absent these 2 factors, SG&A would have shown a reduction year-over-year of $22 million. Lastly, both R&D and equity income were essentially flat year-over-year, so did not impact margin.
Turning to the below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $14 million were $20 million better year-over-year, driven by a gain of $16 million associated with the sale of a noncore business asset. Adjusted tax rate of 26.7% was within our full year range of 24% to 27% and roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06 from the second quarter of 2017, driven by the lower operating profit.
On a GAAP basis, we had $0.42 of earnings per share, which was down $0.21 in the quarter, driven by $0.17 of transaction costs. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox; non-service retirement-related costs; and amortization of intangible assets; as well as the $58 million in transaction costs. 
Revenue continues to be a mixed picture. Overall, total revenue was down 4% in constant currency, which is modestly better than Q1 and full year 2017, driven by equipment revenue. One factor impacting revenue is higher declines in our OEM business, reflected under other revenue, which was down $31 million in the quarter and represented nearly half of actual currency revenue decline. As noted previously, the OEM business has a very concentrated set of customers, and we recently have been impacted by the change in strategy by our largest customer. We expect this headwind to be with us for the remainder of the year with an approximate negative 1 point impact on total revenue.
Turning to the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 1.8% versus down 2.8% in quarter 1 with continued growth in Global Imaging Systems reflecting SMB business as well as an improvement in U.S. enterprise and channels driven by equipment. International declined 3.9% versus 5.5% in quarter 1 at constant currency with the continued pattern of declines in Europe being partially offset by growth in developing markets. Our highest area of decline was in other, driven by the OEM business, as just highlighted. 
Looking at the revenue streams. Equipment sales revenue, or ESR, in the quarter was relatively flat at constant currency, reflecting improvement of the prior year weak equipment sales. From a product area perspective, we saw the following: entry equipment revenue grew 10.6% in constant currency with double-digit growth in both entry color and black and white products. This was a good recovery off the 11% decline last quarter and reflected good demand for new products. Mid-range equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 7.4% in constant currency and had a third quarter in a row of double-digit color install growth. We have started to see share gains after having lost share in mid-range prior to last year's product launch. It is important we maintain this positive momentum so we can rebuild our machines in field. Lastly, high end continues to be weaker, down 9.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with quarter 1. Although we saw a good reception for our recently launched Iridesse platform, we only had a partial quarter of benefit, and it was not enough to offset declines in other product segments, including iGen. 
Post sale declined 5% in constant currency, which was about 1 point worse than trend driven by the continuing dynamics of lower page volumes, reflecting equipment sales declines in prior quarters as well as an approximate negative 0.5 point impact from the lower licensing and prior year contract buyout I referenced earlier. Within post sale, we did see some improvement in supplies revenue, which comprised 13% of total revenue and grew outside of the OEM business. I'll wrap up revenue by highlighting that Managed Document Services grew this quarter, up 2.3%, driven specifically by growth in the SMB-focused Partner Print Services as well as from higher equipment sales.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. As stated, operating margin in the second quarter was 11.9%, an increase of 150 basis points from Q1, however, down 130 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.80, a decline of $0.06 year-over-year. As highlighted earlier, there were a few unique onetime items we're calling out as we think it is helpful to talk separately to the more operational performance and then to the truly unique items. We believe our operational performance drove an adjusted operating margin of 12.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. This reflects a decline year-over-year of 50 basis points to margin and $0.049 to EPS, driven by the impact of revenue declines, which includes ongoing price declines of an approximate 5% on equipment and low single digits on post sale as well as a less favorable margin mix of revenues described earlier. These factors were only partially offset by the positive impact of cost savings and currency. 
In terms of unique onetime items in the quarter, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include $13 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the consolidation of real estate in Rochester. This had a 52 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.036 impact to EPS. As of June 30, this accelerated depreciation has been fully recognized. In addition, there was a $7 million IT project write-off, which had a 28 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.019 impact to EPS. 
Partially offsetting these impacts was a noncore asset sale of $16 million. This came through other expenses net so had no impact on margin, but was a boost to EPS of $0.044. 
For the second half of the year, we're not giving specific guidance on margin as we continue to build out the plan to support the priorities John highlighted. That said, it is correct to take away from our discussion that the focus on improving profitability is very high, and we expect higher margins from this business over time. Operating cash flow was a source of $235 million in the quarter, and we are at $451 million through the first half while free cash flow was a source of $203 million in Q2 and $401 million for the half. 
Cash flow is priority 1 to the business, and I'd like to take a minute to cover our results through 6 months. Working capital has been a use of $93 million through 6 months driven by timing of payments and includes $38 million of transaction and related payments. A great emphasis is being placed on improving all the cash conversion cycle pillars to drive even greater cash efficiency. 
Finance receivables have been a source of $149 million through 6 months, which compares to $167 million for the same period last year. Typically, finance receivables are higher source in the first half given the seasonality of revenues, but this is an area where we would trade in being less of a source for higher equipment sales.  Pension contributions are $75 million through 6 months while restructuring payments are $91 million. Our guidance was for $200 million for the full year for each of these areas. Pension contributions are running under that amount so there could be an opportunity to do better there while restructuring payments will likely not be an opportunity given the greater focus on productivity. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $32 million and is at $50 million through 6 months. This is an area where we are placing greater scrutiny and could be an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. 
In summary, the first half cash flow performance puts us well on track to maintain our full year expectations for both operating cash flow and free cash flow. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll finish by speaking to our capital structure. The second quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $265 million through the repayment of the May 2018 senior notes. We break down debt between financing and core by first calculating the finance debt by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our financing assets, finance receivables and other equipment on operating leases with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business. In Q2, this calculation resulted in an assumed financing debt of $3.5 billion and core debt of $1.7 billion. As the debt letters shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million unfunded pension liabilities, which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
Before turning it back to John, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about guidance. As you just heard from John, we are confident in our business as demonstrated by a reiteration of our cash flow guidance and the resumption of our share repurchase program. We will be driving improvement in all financial measures. And with 75% of our business recurring in nature, we expect results will follow recent trends. However, we want to be sure we are making decisions for longer-term sustainability and hence, won't be giving specific near-term guidance, think balance of the year, outside of cash flow. We will be providing additional details on financial expectations for the business during an Analyst Day in late 2018 or early 2019. 
I'll now turn it back to John for some concluding comments."

If you think of -- if I look at the initial perspective on the business, I see tremendous opportunity and with focus on the priorities we've discussed. But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it in a operational way. Let me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end, from the manufacturing, what the costs are, to the development of it, to what's the value to the client, to how do you maintain it and how you ship it. And something as simple as if you can manufacture and ship a box under GBP 45, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having 2 people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently. Today, as an example, we have 1,400 IP applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution? And our job is to identify all these issues in our processes so we can drive a clear accountability for decision-making and financial performance."

To reiterate a few of my comments on the prepared comments. We are very confident in the business. Yes, we think that the share repurchase is a clear indication of that confidence in the business and that we believe that our current stock price does not reflect its true value of the company. We're driving for improvement on all measures, not just the cash flow measure. And as you know, 75% of our revenues are recurring in nature. And thus, you wouldn't expect our results to differ significantly from recent trends overall. And specifically, I know you understand that we're early in the new leadership here at Xerox, and we're specifically looking at all things. And we're making decisions for the longer term on sustainability. But our overall commitment is to do what's best for Xerox and that won't be measured by the next 3 to 6 months of an adjusted EPS number. With that said, we do believe that the cash flow guidance does provide some guide rails as far as overall expectations on where we'd be for the rest of the year. A few things to think about when you look back last year's results, obviously, Q4 will be a tougher compare versus Q3. There was some onetime items you can go back to, specifically looking what we reported last year in Q3 and Q4, which is calling out like a headwind in Q3 would be -- though there was a Grenoble technology sale that created about a $0.09 headwind, there was a lower tax rate during Q3 of last year, to just a tax reserve adjustments that took place. But overall, then you look at just seasonality of the business is still true no matter what. Q3 tends to have lower operating margins than Q4. And then I guess I'm trying to think through these things. Finally, on share repurchase. People can model through the impact, but we don't expect much of an impact in Q1. There could be up to $0.05 or so potentially, depending if you go to the higher end of the range, it'd be up to $500 million in Q4. And those are sort of things at a higher level to give some context on year-over-year thinking."

New business signings, which are really the -- not all signings are important, but it's critical to say that new business signings were actually up 2% during the quarter. Renewals are somewhat can be lumpy in nature, depending on what is the opportunity and what's available. And actually, the amount that came up for renewals during the quarter had a fair amount of impact. There was just less coming up in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. But renewals were down. And part of that was also due to the win rate. Percentage was clearly lower than our targeted 90% plus win rate and lower than our prior year win rate. We were at about year 75%. But really that was driven by 2 larger enterprise deals. And so like I said, there's lumpiness and there's also just large deals can drive that percentage from quarter-to-quarter. And clearly, you look at it, yes, we're striving to do well in all parts of the market. But clearly, we're also very pleased with what's happening in the SMB side of the signings area where we don't get as quite as much detailed information because we're dealing with partners a lot. But the end results when you look at what's happening in the MDS, we feel good about that."

But how do you take other products, whether it's a new technology that you are -- that you have in your innovation, those are some of the best-kept secrets out there in the industry. So as recently as a few days ago, I spoke to a very high-level executive in a financial organization and just took them through some of the offerings we have over and above what we offer today, the MDS, the services. And we're going to do an Innovation Day with their team. And this is in a competitive environment. So it's a non-Xerox account. And they want to see. Because most of our clients are asking us, tell us what we don't know. You have these great products. But what else do you have? And that's where I got excited when asked, ""Hey, John. What's different when I got here?"" That's one of the areas that's different, that our innovation assets are much better than I even assumed when I was looking at it. But how do we get it to market faster? And that's part of getting it to market faster. It's not just what we have today, but a lot more. How do we capitalize on that? We have tremendous assets like DocuShare, whether it's XMPie. These are game changers for clients. How do we assure ourselves that we use our go-to-market-like channels to help us get that to clients faster."

There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming on board that there has been even more. It's -- John said in his comments, maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that. We're comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided originally that we're reiterating, that we provided recently in January. As far as the working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, day sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we're working to improve all of those significantly. Even though we had originally planned that -- it's just that the need to actually -- those will make it even better, I guess, I would view it from a cash flows perspective that if you look at where we're at year-to-date on cash flows, we're already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest, that improvements in working capital, additional improvements will only help us and give us upside. It's really my perspective on that. From an MDS perspective, don't like -- they start going to the months. As we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months within a quarter. With that said, overall, MDS was up 2.3%. MDS revenues, 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MDS. The channels or the SMB part of the business continues to be strong. It's growing double digit again and up 14.4% in MDS revenues. And enterprise, still continue to be -- it's more competitive, more mature market was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MDS. And we expect to continue to be that. The 2 larger deals we lost during the quarter, we're not happy about. But overall, to the longer term, we're still expecting to be strong in MDS."

Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we have set to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
I joined the company because I saw an opportunity to rebuild Xerox into a leading tech company. I've spent considerable time talking with customers, partners and employees. There is one common theme: they want us to succeed. We are an important and often critical component of our customers' and partners' work processes and their success. They recognize the quality and ease of use of our products and many have strong, personal relationships with our company. Channel partners work with us because of the breadth of our portfolio and because of the support we provide, such as the marketing and training tools and resources that help them grow their business. Our customers and partners expect Xerox to bring breakthrough solutions to the market more quickly, to help them keep pace with continuously changing technology landscape, and we need to be easier to do business with. Xerox employees care deeply about our company. One of the first things I did as CEO was reach out to employees and ask them to share with me what they think of Xerox. What do we do well? And where do we need to improve? Their responses reaffirmed my assumption that the team has the knowledge and enthusiasm to transform this company, and they want change. They want to be part of a company that is growing, a company with a new way of working, a company they can be proud of. 
We have a portfolio of leading-edge, feature-rich products and solutions that support the needs of our customers. In the office, we have ConnectKey technology that is powered by an embedded, secure, cloud-enabled workflow management software platform with artificial intelligence and real-time analytics that enables the same app-based flexibility on our products that app stores do on mobile phones. Software-based flexibility is the new paradigm for hardware, and we are leading our industry with ConnectKey. With the Xerox App Gallery, users can download apps to a ConnectKey device and make their work easier. There are apps with broad appeal, like those that scan to a cloud-based repository and apps that are industry-specific, like the health care MFP app, which enables the HIPAA-compliant paper-to-digital content workflow. 
At the high end of the business, our focus is on helping our graphic communication customers be more profitable. In May, we launched the Iridesse Production Press. What is special about Iridesse is its ability to use clear and metallic silver and gold dry inks for print embellishments, a lucrative market for commercial printers. By layering the inks, it can create images that are iridescent in one pass through the machine, eliminating multiple presses and processes, saving our customers both time and money. Demand for Iridesse has exceeded our plan.
Beyond products are our software and services. We are a leader in managed print services. Industry analyst firms, IDC, noted in their most recent report that we have been at the forefront of the industry when it comes to enabling workflow optimization. We are growing this business, expanding offerings for the channel, but growth remains in the low single digits. This tells me that we have more work to be done. 
Our software businesses are some of our best-kept secrets. They are small, but they have tremendous growth potential. For example, our DocuShare offering -- think Dropbox, think Box, is a cloud-enabled and helps companies manage their digital content, one of the biggest challenges we all face. We will soon launch a series of solutions for our DocuShare Flex cloud repository that will connect and allow the integration with applications, such as Salesforce, Intuit and DigiSign. Such integrations will simplify business processes and enable automated workflow apps.
XMPie is a second software business, and it provides customers with technology to transform their print business into omnichannel print and digital communication businesses. Just last week, we won an InterTec award for XMPie's Circle PersonalEffect Edition. This automation software connects every stage of marketing campaign production. We need to take our software and services businesses to the next level. 
One of the first areas I recognized that we must take better advantage of is our innovation and high-tech portfolio. I conducted reviews in PARC in our operations in Webster, New York and was impressed by what I saw. We have valuable and differentiated offerings that are underutilized as well as some new technologies, work that's underway in our labs that has the potential to disrupt industries. And as we develop and deploy these technologies, we must think differently about business models. Is our role to be the system integrator and provider of the entire offering? Or for some of these technologies, are we better off following the model of Intel in the PC industry and focus on high-value technology elements and sell them broadly across an industry? What I saw in our labs tells me that Xerox has the potential to go beyond our current core markets and achieve scale by providing a critical technology element for several high-growth emerging areas where we do not participate today. While we may choose not to develop the product, we have technology that will go into others' products: it could be inks and imaging systems for digital packaging; it could be printheads and materials for 3D printing; it could be low-cost pollution or hazardous gas sensors to keep us and the environment safe. The exact path of these opportunities is hard to predict, but the opportunities are real. 
Another opportunity is in optimizing our business. To do that, we need to look at things differently. Xerox has been running cost takeout programs for years, but they have not been effective. The benefits are not flowing to the bottom line. And as we saw this quarter, margin was down 130 basis points. The processes and the systems we use are complex, as is our operating model. For example, there's a lack of clarity on decision authority and who is accountable for outcomes in our current matrix organizational construct. Often, the result is management by committee and a painful decision-making process. We have over 1,000 IT systems. It takes resources to manage all these systems and disparate data from various systems hampers the decision-making process. From order entry to product install, to repair and billing, we need to redefine our supply chain not only to meet customer requirements, but also increase our competitiveness. We will anchor the transformation of our business on improving how we serve our customers and partners, better differentiating our products, services, systems and resources based on the way they want to be served. 
The majority of our revenues are recurring, which drives the dynamic of a relatively stable cash flow over time. This cash flow gives us the room to invest in the business and more directly return cash to shareholders. We have not effectively deployed our capital. M&A has been minimal, and we've not done share repurchases in the recent past. It's important that we have a maniacal focus on maximizing cash flow, ensuring its strength well into the future.
From this assessment of the business, we can pivot to our priorities. First, we have an opportunity to drive improvement in our top line by addressing how we go to market. We need to take a strategic approach to customer engagement, to meet their evolving needs, both in how they choose to buy and the level of service necessary for their business. We're going to make sure that we have the right mix of direct, indirect and online or e-commerce channels to support our various clients. And we're going to work with our channel partners, whether they are agents, concessionaires, document technology partners, solution providers or velocity partners to create frictionless processes and quick response times. To make this happen, we need to optimize our operations, which is our second priority. This is more than just process optimization. We need to optimize the way we are organized: our product portfolio; our supply chain; our financial model. 
Xerox carries the legacy of a much larger business with processes, systems and resources beyond what are required or affordable today. We need to change the way we operate. In our supply chain, we need to think differently and holistically to eliminate costs while ensuring we get the right offering to the right customer at the right time. We will drive for greater efficiencies, reduced complexity and faster time-to-market to enable an [indiscernible], integrated customer experience. 
As we improve our operations, we know that to be a tech company, we must reenergize our innovation engine and to revamp our innovation business model, to invest in our own capabilities as well as M&A to enable commercialization of technologies we create. We also need to pursue more partnerships to accelerate our competencies while still maintaining our core differentiation in IT for value capture. And finally, we will have a priority of always focusing on our cash flow and capital returns to generate shareholder value. 
I spoke earlier how cash flow is a critical measure. We are looking at everything, all the pillars of working capital to drive cash flow growth. And in terms of capital deployment, we are revitalizing our M&A engine, and we'll deliver our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders. And today, we announced that Xerox Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and that the company will opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in 2018. This positive step forward is a strong endorsement of the company and represents an immediate action to deliver value to our investors. 
I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions I hear. First, we are not conducting an auction process for the company. An auction is time-consuming and costly. If a potential buyer comes forward, it is the responsibility of the board to consider any proposal that could generate additional shareholder value. The team and I are committed to doing what's best for Xerox, and we are focused on strengthening the company. We've been asked if all the recent news, headlines and changes have negatively impacted our business. That's not something that is easily measurable, but I can tell you we're not here to give excuses. What we've realized is that our customers and partners want us to succeed. We have work to do to further simplify our operation, but we have a solid base to start from. And that is going to be our focus. We're not looking back. That's also why I'm not going to talk about Strategic Transformation program. We are taking a new comprehensive end-to-end approach to optimize our operations, drive sustainable cost saving more directly to the bottom line and improve how we serve our clients and partners. 
The final 2 questions are related to Fuji Xerox. As you know, in June, I sent a letter to Fujifilm Chairman Komori, in response to their lawsuit seeking to save the proposed merger of Fuji Xerox and Xerox. We are confident in our right to terminate the transaction and we'll defend ourselves through the legal process. The lawsuit was the first communication I received from Fujifilm or Fuji Xerox, and it was a surprising tactic from a company that is also our supplier. 
The letter to Fujifilm stated that we currently do not intend to renew our TA agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires in 2021. I want to clarify what that means. First, Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, and the TA establishes the technology and brand licensing relationships between the 2 companies. Not renewing the TA does not dissolve the joint venture. We have a 25% ownership position in Fuji Xerox that is governed by a separate joint enterprise contract. 
As I have said, we will do what is best for Xerox. This is true of the work that we are doing to improve our supply chain to be more competitive. This means we need to source products, parts and supplies from the best and most competitive suppliers. Fuji Xerox is one of our suppliers, today providing 59% of our cost production, and we will continue to work with them in areas where they are competitive. We manufacture a portion of the remaining 41% ourselves and have high-quality suppliers for the rest. But we are rethinking the way we choose our suppliers. The company in the past has not seriously pursued other suppliers. But recently, we were successful in partnering with a supplier for a new product. Just because a supplier has had business with Xerox in the past does not guarantee future business. They will have to earn our business. With all of our suppliers, we execute comprehensive contracts for each product. And these contracts assure continuity of parts and supplies over the product's life. As for Fuji specifically, we have not seen any disruption in our supply chain. I am confident in the continuity of supply of Xerox equipment parts and supplies, and we have time to work changes in our supply chain to be more competitive and to better serve our customers and partners. 
At this point, we turn to the financial results. Our second quarter results were mixed. Equipment revenue and cash flow were good while margin was pressured. Total revenue declined 4% at constant currency. Within that, equipment revenue was better, up 0.9% or down 0.6% at constant currency. Post sale revenue was a disappointment, down 5%. There were a couple of one-off factors that Bill will cover, but we need to deliver multiple quarters of better equipment performance to drive post sales revenue improvement. 
Profitability in the quarter was lower than expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter, but declined 130 basis points year-over-year as cost savings were not enough to offset the impacts of revenue declines and other factors. As a result, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06, reflecting the impact of the overall lower operating profit. 
Through the first half of the year, we generated $451 million of operating cash flow, which was above our expectation, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, with the restart of our share repurchase program, we plan to opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in shares in 2018. We are committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Return of cash flow to investors is an important and appropriate element of our capital allocation policy given our strong cash flow profile. And we are pleased to restart the program, especially at a time when we believe our shares are not trading at their underlying value. 
I'd like to hand the presentation over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to review our financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with the review of the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds, a diminishing benefit from the approximate 4% top line currency impact in Q1. 
As John highlighted, we are not seeing the degree of turnaround in revenue that we believe should follow our recent significant product launches. And while equipment revenue market share improved 1 point year-over-year in Q1, the latest available share data, we need our market share to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and improve trends in post sale. I'll cover in more detail what we're seeing in revenue by geography and product area on the next slide.
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline came from the combination of insufficient productivity to offset revenue declines as well as a few quarter-specific headwinds. Gross margin of 39.9% was down 70 basis points in the quarter, driven in part by a less profitable mix of revenues. From a stream perspective, we had a higher percentage of equipment versus post sale. And within equipment, we weighted toward lower-end product sales. Additionally, last year's results included positive impacts in post sale from a contract buyout and higher licensing revenue. 
Within SG&A, as forecasted last quarter, we were impacted by $13 million of accelerated depreciation related to a decision to consolidate facilities in Rochester. The combined Q1 and Q2 impact was $22 million. Going forward, it will save us about $13 million annually. We also had a $7 million impact from the write-off of an IT project, within delivery, that would seem to no longer have a sufficient return on invested capital due to changes we are making in the business. Absent these 2 factors, SG&A would have shown a reduction year-over-year of $22 million. Lastly, both R&D and equity income were essentially flat year-over-year, so did not impact margin.
Turning to the below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $14 million were $20 million better year-over-year, driven by a gain of $16 million associated with the sale of a noncore business asset. Adjusted tax rate of 26.7% was within our full year range of 24% to 27% and roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06 from the second quarter of 2017, driven by the lower operating profit.
On a GAAP basis, we had $0.42 of earnings per share, which was down $0.21 in the quarter, driven by $0.17 of transaction costs. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox; non-service retirement-related costs; and amortization of intangible assets; as well as the $58 million in transaction costs. 
Revenue continues to be a mixed picture. Overall, total revenue was down 4% in constant currency, which is modestly better than Q1 and full year 2017, driven by equipment revenue. One factor impacting revenue is higher declines in our OEM business, reflected under other revenue, which was down $31 million in the quarter and represented nearly half of actual currency revenue decline. As noted previously, the OEM business has a very concentrated set of customers, and we recently have been impacted by the change in strategy by our largest customer. We expect this headwind to be with us for the remainder of the year with an approximate negative 1 point impact on total revenue.
Turning to the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 1.8% versus down 2.8% in quarter 1 with continued growth in Global Imaging Systems reflecting SMB business as well as an improvement in U.S. enterprise and channels driven by equipment. International declined 3.9% versus 5.5% in quarter 1 at constant currency with the continued pattern of declines in Europe being partially offset by growth in developing markets. Our highest area of decline was in other, driven by the OEM business, as just highlighted. 
Looking at the revenue streams. Equipment sales revenue, or ESR, in the quarter was relatively flat at constant currency, reflecting improvement off the prior year weak equipment sales. From a product area perspective, we saw the following: entry equipment revenue grew 10.6% in constant currency with double-digit growth in both entry color and black and white products. This was a good recovery off the 11% decline last quarter and reflected good demand for new products. Mid-range equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 7.4% in constant currency and had a third quarter in a row of double-digit color install growth. We have started to see share gains after having lost share in mid-range prior to last year's product launch. It is important we maintain this positive momentum so we can rebuild our machines in field. Lastly, high end continues to be weaker, down 9.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with quarter 1. Although we saw a good reception for our recently launched Iridesse platform, we only had a partial quarter of benefit, and it was not enough to offset declines in other product segments, including iGen. 
Post sale declined 5% in constant currency, which was about 1 point worse than trend driven by the continuing dynamics of lower page volumes, reflecting equipment sales declines in prior quarters as well as an approximate negative 0.5 point impact from the lower licensing and prior year contract buyout I referenced earlier. Within post sale, we did see some improvement in supplies revenue, which comprised 13% of total revenue and grew outside of the OEM business. I'll wrap up revenue by highlighting that Managed Document Services grew this quarter, up 2.3%, driven specifically by growth in the SMB-focused Partner Print Services as well as from higher equipment sales.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. As stated, operating margin in the second quarter was 11.9%, an increase of 150 basis points from Q1, however, down 130 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.80, a decline of $0.06 year-over-year. As highlighted earlier, there were a few unique onetime items we're calling out as we think it is helpful to talk separately to the more operational performance and then to the truly unique items. We believe our operational performance drove an adjusted operating margin of 12.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. This reflects a decline year-over-year of 50 basis points to margin and $0.049 to EPS, driven by the impact of revenue declines, which includes ongoing price declines of an approximate 5% on equipment and low single digits on post sale as well as a less favorable margin mix of revenues as described earlier. These factors were only partially offset by the positive impact of cost savings and currency. 
In terms of unique onetime items in the quarter, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: $13 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the consolidation of real estate in Rochester. This had a 52 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.036 impact to EPS. As of June 30, this accelerated depreciation has been fully recognized. In addition, there was a $7 million IT project write-off, which had a 28 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.019 impact to EPS. 
Partially offsetting these impacts was a noncore asset sale of $16 million. This came through other expenses net so had no impact on margin, but was a boost to EPS of $0.044. 
For the second half of the year, we're not giving specific guidance on margin as we continue to build out the plan to support the priorities John highlighted. That said, it is correct to take away from our discussion that the focus on improving profitability is very high, and we expect higher margins from this business over time. Operating cash flow was a source of $235 million in the quarter, and we are at $451 million through the first half while free cash flow was a source of $203 million in Q2 and $401 million for the half. 
Cash flow is priority 1 to the business, and I'd like to take a minute to cover our results through 6 months. Working capital has been a use of $93 million through 6 months driven by timing of payments and includes $38 million of transaction and related payments. A great emphasis is being placed on improving all the cash conversion cycle pillars to drive even greater cash efficiency. 
Finance receivables have been a source of $149 million through 6 months, which compares to $167 million for the same period last year. Typically, finance receivables are a higher source in the first half given the seasonality of revenues, but this is an area where we would trade it, being less of a source for higher equipment sales. Pension contributions are $75 million through 6 months while restructuring payments are $91 million. Our guidance was for $200 million for the full year for each of these areas. Pension contributions are running under that amount so there could be an opportunity to do better there while restructuring payments will likely not be an opportunity given the greater focus on productivity. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $32 million and is at $50 million through 6 months. This is an area where we are placing greater scrutiny and could be an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. 
In summary, the first half cash flow performance puts us well on track to maintain our full year expectations for both operating cash flow and free cash flow. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll finish by speaking to our capital structure. The second quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $265 million through the repayment of the May 2018 senior notes. We break down debt between financing and core by first calculating the finance debt by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our financing assets, finance receivables and other equipment on operating leases with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business. In Q2, this calculation resulted in an assumed financing debt of $3.5 billion and core debt of $1.7 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million unfunded pension liabilities which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
Before turning it back to John, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about guidance. As you just heard from John, we are confident in our business as demonstrated by a reiteration of our cash flow guidance and the resumption of our share repurchase program. We will be driving improvement in all financial measures. And with 75% of our business recurring in nature, we expect results will follow recent trends. However, we want to be sure we are making decisions for longer-term sustainability and hence, won't be giving specific near-term guidance -- think balance of the year, outside of cash flow. We will be providing additional details on financial expectations for the business during an Analyst Day in late 2018 or early 2019. 
I'll now turn it back to John for some concluding comments."

If you think of -- if I look at the initial perspective on the business, I see tremendous opportunity and with focus on the priorities we discussed. But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it in an operational way. Let me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end, from the manufacturing, what the costs are, to the development of it, to what's the value to the client, to how do you maintain it and how you ship it. And something as simple as if you can manufacture and ship a box under 45 pounds, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having 2 people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently. Today, as an example, we have 1,400 IT applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution? And our job is to identify all these issues in our processes so we can drive a clear end-to-end accountability for decision-making and financial performance."

To reiterate a few of my comments on the prepared comments. We are very confident in the business. We think that the share repurchase is a clear indication of that confidence in the business and that we believe that our current stock price does not reflect its true value of the company. We're driving for improvement on all measures, not just the cash flow measure. And as you know, 75% of our revenues are recurring in nature. And thus, you wouldn't expect our results to differ significantly from recent trends overall. And specifically, I know you understand that we're early in the new leadership here at Xerox, and we're specifically looking at all things. And we're making decisions for the longer term on sustainability. But our overall commitment is to do what's best for Xerox and that won't be measured by the next 3 to 6 months of an adjusted EPS number. With that said, we do believe that the cash flow guidance does provide some guide rails as far as overall expectations on where we'd be for the rest of the year. A few things to think about when you look back last year's results, obviously, Q4 will be a tougher compare versus Q3. There was some onetime items you can go back to, specifically looking at what we reported last year in Q3 and Q4, which is calling out like a headwind in Q3 would be -- there was a Grenoble technology sale that created about a $0.09 headwind, there was a lower tax rate during Q3 of last year, to do some tax reserve adjustments that took place. But overall, then you look at just seasonality of the business is still true no matter what. Q3 tends to have lower operating margins than Q4. And then I guess I'm trying to think through these things. Finally, on share repurchase. People can model through the impact, but we don't expect much of an impact in Q1. There could be up to $0.05 or so potentially, depending if you go to the higher end of the range, it'd be up to $500 million in Q4. And those are sort of things at a higher level to give some context on year-over-year thinking."

But we're focused starting today on doing everything that we've said in our business, which is how do we help drive revenue, how do we optimize our operations, how do we reenergize the innovation engine and our continuous focus on capital returns and on cash flows. So that starts today. In fact, it started 8 weeks ago, but -- and we're continuing to focus on that."

And yes, signings down 20.6%, just breaking that down a little bit more detail. New business signings, which are really the -- all signings are important, but it's critical to say that new business signings were actually up 2% during the quarter. Renewals are somewhat can be lumpy in nature, depending on what is the opportunity and what's available. And actually, the amount that came up for renewal during the quarter had a fair amount of impact. There was just less coming up in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. But renewals were down. And part of that was also due to the win rate. Percentage was clearly lower than our targeted 90% plus win rate and lower than our prior year win rate. We were at about year 75%. But really that was driven by 2 larger enterprise deals. And so like I said, there's lumpiness and there's also just large deals can drive that percentage from quarter-to-quarter. And clearly, you look at it, yes, we're striving to do well in all parts of the market. But clearly, we're also very pleased with what's happening in the SMB side of the signings area where we don't get as quite as much detailed information because we're dealing with partners a lot. But the end result is when you look at what's happening in MDS, we feel good about that."

That seems actually counter to your prepared comments of the great relationships you have and the need and the value that Xerox is providing because a renewal rate of 75% is not overly encouraging.

But how do you take other products, whether it's a new technology that you are -- that you have in your innovation, those are some of the best-kept secrets out there in the industry. So as recently as a few days ago, I spoke to a very high-level executive in a financial organization and just took them through some of the offerings we have over and above what we offer today, the MDS, the services. And we're going to do an Innovation Day with their team. And this is in a competitive environment. So it's a non-Xerox account. And they want to see. Because most of our clients are asking us, tell us what we don't know. You have these great products. But what else do you have? And that's where I got excited when asked, ""Hey, John. What's different when I got here?"" That's one of the areas that's different, is that our innovation assets are much better than I even assumed when I was looking at it. But how do we get it to market faster? And that's part of getting it to market faster. It's not just what we have today, but a lot more. How do we capitalize on that? We have tremendous assets like DocuShare, whether it's XMPie. These are game changers for clients. How do we assure ourselves that we use our go-to-market and our channels to help us get that to clients faster."

There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming on board that there has been even more. It's -- John said in his comments, maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that. We're comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided originally that we're reiterating, that we provided originally in January. As far as the working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, day sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we're working to improve all of those significantly. Even though we had originally planned that -- it's just that the need to actually -- those will make it even better, I guess, I would view it from a cash flows perspective that if you look at where we're at year-to-date on cash flows, we're already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest, that improvements in working capital, additional improvements will only help us and give us upside. It's really my perspective on that. From an MDS perspective, don't like to start going to the months. As we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months within a quarter. With that said, overall, MDS was up 2.3%. MDS revenues, 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MDS. The channels or the SMB part of the business continues to be strong. It's growing double digits -- digits again and up 14.4% in MDS revenues. And enterprise, still continues to be -- it's more competitive, more mature market. It was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MDS. And we expect to continue to be that. The 2 larger deals we lost during the quarter, we're not happy about. But overall, over the longer term, we're still expecting to be strong in MDS."

Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we have set to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
I joined the company because I saw an opportunity to rebuild Xerox into a leading tech company. I've spent considerable time talking with customers, partners and employees. There is one common theme: they want us to succeed. We are an important and often critical component of our customers' and partners' work processes and their success. They recognize the quality and ease of use of our products and many have strong, personal relationships with our company. Channel partners work with us because of the breadth of our portfolio and because of the support we provide, such as the marketing and training tools and resources that help them grow their business. Our customers and partners expect Xerox to bring breakthrough solutions to the market more quickly, to help them keep pace with continuously changing technology landscape, and we need to be easier to do business with. Xerox employees care deeply about our company. One of the first things I did as CEO was reach out to employees and ask them to share with me what they think of Xerox. What do we do well? And where do we need to improve? Their responses reaffirmed my assumption that the team has the knowledge and enthusiasm to transform this company, and they want change. They want to be part of a company that is growing, a company with a new way of working, a company they can be proud of. 
We have a portfolio of leading-edge, feature-rich products and solutions that support the needs of our customers. In the office, we have ConnectKey technology that is powered by an embedded, secure, cloud-enabled workflow management software platform with artificial intelligence and real-time analytics that enables the same app-based flexibility on our products that app stores do on mobile phones. Software-based flexibility is the new paradigm for hardware, and we are leading our industry with ConnectKey. With the Xerox App Gallery, users can download apps to a ConnectKey device and make their work easier. There are apps with broad appeal, like those that scan to a cloud-based repository and apps that are industry-specific, like the health care MFP app, which enables the HIPAA-compliant paper-to-digital content workflow. 
At the high end of the business, our focus is on helping our graphic communication customers be more profitable. In May, we launched the Iridesse Production Press. What is special about Iridesse is its ability to use clear and metallic silver and gold dry inks for print embellishments, a lucrative market for commercial printers. By layering the inks, it can create images that are iridescent in one pass through the machine, eliminating multiple presses and processes, saving our customers both time and money. Demand for Iridesse has exceeded our plan.
Beyond products are our software and services. We are a leader in managed print services. Industry analyst firms, IDC, noted in their most recent report that we have been at the forefront of the industry when it comes to enabling workflow optimization. We are growing this business, expanding offerings for the channel, but growth remains in the low single digits. This tells me that we have more work to be done. 
Our software businesses are some of our best-kept secrets. They are small, but they have tremendous growth potential. For example, our DocuShare offering -- think Dropbox, think Box, is a cloud-enabled and helps companies manage their digital content, one of the biggest challenges we all face. We will soon launch a series of solutions for our DocuShare Flex cloud repository that will connect and allow the integration with applications, such as Salesforce, Intuit and DigiSign. Such integrations will simplify business processes and enable automated workflow apps.
XMPie is a second software business, and it provides customers with technology to transform their print business into omnichannel print and digital communication businesses. Just last week, we won an InterTech award for XMPie's Circle PersonalEffect Edition. This automation software connects every stage of marketing campaign production. We need to take our software and services businesses to the next level. 
One of the first areas I recognized that we must take better advantage of is our innovation and high-tech portfolio. I conducted reviews in PARC in our operations in Webster, New York and was impressed by what I saw. We have valuable and differentiated offerings that are underutilized as well as some new technologies, work that's underway in our labs that has the potential to disrupt industries. And as we develop and deploy these technologies, we must think differently about business models. Is our role to be the system integrator and provider of the entire offering? Or for some of these technologies, are we better off following the model of Intel in the PC industry and focus on high-value technology elements and sell them broadly across an industry? What I saw in our labs tells me that Xerox has the potential to go beyond our current core markets and achieve scale by providing a critical technology element for several high-growth emerging areas where we do not participate today. While we may choose not to develop the product, we have technology that will go into others' products: it could be inks and imaging systems for digital packaging; it could be printheads and materials for 3D printing; it could be low-cost pollution or hazardous gas sensors to keep us and the environment safe. The exact path of these opportunities is hard to predict, but the opportunities are real. 
Another opportunity is in optimizing our business. To do that, we need to look at things differently. Xerox has been running cost takeout programs for years, but they have not been effective. The benefits are not flowing to the bottom line. And as we saw this quarter, margin was down 130 basis points. The processes and the systems we use are complex, as is our operating model. For example, there's a lack of clarity on decision authority and who is accountable for outcomes in our current matrix organizational construct. Often, the result is management by committee and a painful decision-making process. We have over 1,000 IT systems. It takes resources to manage all these systems and disparate data from various systems hampers the decision-making process. From order entry to product install, to repair and billing, we need to redefine our supply chain not only to meet customer requirements, but also increase our competitiveness. We will anchor the transformation of our business on improving how we serve our customers and partners, better differentiating our products, services, systems and resources based on the way they want to be served. 
The majority of our revenues are recurring, which drives the dynamic of a relatively stable cash flow over time. This cash flow gives us the room to invest in the business and more directly return cash to shareholders. We have not effectively deployed our capital. M&A has been minimal, and we've not done share repurchases in the recent past. It's important that we have a maniacal focus on maximizing cash flow, ensuring its strength well into the future.
From this assessment of the business, we can pivot to our priorities. First, we have an opportunity to drive improvement in our top line by addressing how we go to market. We need to take a strategic approach to customer engagement, to meet their evolving needs, both in how they choose to buy and the level of service necessary for their business. We're going to make sure that we have the right mix of direct, indirect and online or e-commerce channels to support our various clients. And we're going to work with our channel partners, whether they are agents, concessionaires, document technology partners, solution providers or velocity partners to create frictionless processes and quick response times. To make this happen, we need to optimize our operations, which is our second priority. This is more than just process optimization. We need to optimize the way we are organized: our product portfolio; our supply chain; our financial model. 
Xerox carries the legacy of a much larger business with processes, systems and resources beyond what are required or affordable today. We need to change the way we operate. In our supply chain, we need to think differently and holistically to eliminate costs while ensuring we get the right offering to the right customer at the right time. We will drive for greater efficiencies, reduced complexity and faster time-to-market to enable an [indiscernible], integrated customer experience. 
As we improve our operations, we know that to be a tech company, we must reenergize our innovation engine and to revamp our innovation business model, to invest in our own capabilities as well as M&A to enable commercialization of technologies we create. We also need to pursue more partnerships to accelerate our competencies while still maintaining our core differentiation in IT for value capture. And finally, we will have a priority of always focusing on our cash flow and capital returns to generate shareholder value. 
I spoke earlier how cash flow is a critical measure. We are looking at everything, all the pillars of working capital to drive cash flow growth. And in terms of capital deployment, we are revitalizing our M&A engine, and we'll deliver our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders. And today, we announced that Xerox Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and that the company will opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in 2018. This positive step forward is a strong endorsement of the company and represents an immediate action to deliver value to our investors. 
I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions I hear. First, we are not conducting an auction process for the company. An auction is time-consuming and costly. If a potential buyer comes forward, it is the responsibility of the board to consider any proposal that could generate additional shareholder value. The team and I are committed to doing what's best for Xerox, and we are focused on strengthening the company. We've been asked if all the recent news, headlines and changes have negatively impacted our business. That's not something that is easily measurable, but I can tell you we're not here to give excuses. What we've realized is that our customers and partners want us to succeed. We have work to do to further simplify our operation, but we have a solid base to start from. And that is going to be our focus. We're not looking back. That's also why I'm not going to talk about Strategic Transformation program. We are taking a new comprehensive end-to-end approach to optimize our operations, drive sustainable cost saving more directly to the bottom line and improve how we serve our clients and partners. 
The final 2 questions are related to Fuji Xerox. As you know, in June, I sent a letter to Fujifilm Chairman Komori, in response to their lawsuit seeking to save the proposed merger of Fuji Xerox and Xerox. We are confident in our right to terminate the transaction and we'll defend ourselves through the legal process. The lawsuit was the first communication I received from Fujifilm or Fuji Xerox, and it was a surprising tactic from a company that is also our supplier. 
The letter to Fujifilm stated that we currently do not intend to renew our TA agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires in 2021. I want to clarify what that means. First, Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, and the TA establishes the technology and brand licensing relationships between the 2 companies. Not renewing the TA does not dissolve the joint venture. We have a 25% ownership position in Fuji Xerox that is governed by a separate joint enterprise contract. 
As I have said, we will do what is best for Xerox. This is true of the work that we are doing to improve our supply chain to be more competitive. This means we need to source products, parts and supplies from the best and most competitive suppliers. Fuji Xerox is one of our suppliers, today providing 59% of our cost production, and we will continue to work with them in areas where they are competitive. We manufacture a portion of the remaining 41% ourselves and have high-quality suppliers for the rest. But we are rethinking the way we choose our suppliers. The company in the past has not seriously pursued other suppliers. But recently, we were successful in partnering with a supplier for a new product. Just because a supplier has had business with Xerox in the past does not guarantee future business. They will have to earn our business. With all of our suppliers, we execute comprehensive contracts for each product. And these contracts assure continuity of parts and supplies over the product's life. As for Fuji specifically, we have not seen any disruption in our supply chain. I am confident in the continuity of supply of Xerox equipment parts and supplies, and we have time to work changes in our supply chain to be more competitive and to better serve our customers and partners. 
At this point, we turn to the financial results. Our second quarter results were mixed. Equipment revenue and cash flow were good while margin was pressured. Total revenue declined 4% at constant currency. Within that, equipment revenue was better, up 0.9% or down 0.6% at constant currency. Post sale revenue was a disappointment, down 5%. There were a couple of one-off factors that Bill will cover, but we need to deliver multiple quarters of better equipment performance to drive post sales revenue improvement. 
Profitability in the quarter was lower than expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter, but declined 130 basis points year-over-year as cost savings were not enough to offset the impacts of revenue declines and other factors. As a result, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06, reflecting the impact of the overall lower operating profit. 
Through the first half of the year, we generated $451 million of operating cash flow, which was above our expectation, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, with the restart of our share repurchase program, we plan to opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in shares in 2018. We are committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Return of cash flow to investors is an important and appropriate element of our capital allocation policy given our strong cash flow profile. And we are pleased to restart the program, especially at a time when we believe our shares are not trading at their underlying value. 
I'd like to hand the presentation over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to review our financial performance in more detail."

Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds, a diminishing benefit from the approximate 4% top line currency impact in Q1. 
As John highlighted, we are not seeing the degree of turnaround in revenue that we believe should follow our recent significant product launches. And while equipment revenue market share improved 1 point year-over-year in Q1, the latest available share data, we need our market share to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and improve trends in post sale. I'll cover in more detail what we're seeing in revenue by geography and product area on the next slide.
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline came from the combination of insufficient productivity to offset revenue declines as well as a few quarter-specific headwinds. Gross margin of 39.9% was down 70 basis points in the quarter, driven in part by a less profitable mix of revenues. From a stream perspective, we had a higher percentage of equipment versus post sale. And within equipment, we weighted toward lower-end product sales. Additionally, last year's results included positive impacts in post sale from a contract buyout and higher licensing revenue. 
Within SG&A, as forecasted last quarter, we were impacted by $13 million of accelerated depreciation related to a decision to consolidate facilities in Rochester. The combined Q1 and Q2 impact was $22 million. Going forward, it will save us about $13 million annually. We also had a $7 million impact from the write-off of an IT project, within delivery, that would seem to no longer have a sufficient return on invested capital due to changes we are making in the business. Absent these 2 factors, SG&A would have shown a reduction year-over-year of $22 million. Lastly, both R&D and equity income were essentially flat year-over-year, so did not impact margin.
Turning to the below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $14 million were $20 million better year-over-year, driven by a gain of $16 million associated with the sale of a noncore business asset. Adjusted tax rate of 26.7% was within our full year range of 24% to 27% and roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06 from the second quarter of 2017, driven by the lower operating profit.
On a GAAP basis, we had $0.42 of earnings per share, which was down $0.21 in the quarter, driven by $0.17 of transaction costs. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox; non-service retirement-related costs; and amortization of intangible assets; as well as the $58 million in transaction costs. 
Revenue continues to be a mixed picture. Overall, total revenue was down 4% in constant currency, which is modestly better than Q1 and full year 2017, driven by equipment revenue. One factor impacting revenue is higher declines in our OEM business, reflected under other revenue, which was down $31 million in the quarter and represented nearly half of actual currency revenue decline. As noted previously, the OEM business has a very concentrated set of customers, and we recently have been impacted by the change in strategy by our largest customer. We expect this headwind to be with us for the remainder of the year with an approximate negative 1 point impact on total revenue.
Turning to the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 1.8% versus down 2.8% in quarter 1 with continued growth in Global Imaging Systems reflecting SMB business as well as an improvement in U.S. enterprise and channels driven by equipment. International declined 3.9% versus 5.5% in quarter 1 at constant currency with the continued pattern of declines in Europe being partially offset by growth in developing markets. Our highest area of decline was in other, driven by the OEM business, as just highlighted. 
Looking at the revenue streams. Equipment sales revenue, or ESR, in the quarter was relatively flat at constant currency, reflecting improvement off the prior year weak equipment sales. From a product area perspective, we saw the following: entry equipment revenue grew 10.6% in constant currency with double-digit growth in both entry color and black and white products. This was a good recovery off the 11% decline last quarter and reflected good demand for new products. Mid-range equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 7.4% in constant currency and had a third quarter in a row of double-digit color install growth. We have started to see share gains after having lost share in mid-range prior to last year's product launch. It is important we maintain this positive momentum so we can rebuild our machines in field. Lastly, high end continues to be weaker, down 9.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with quarter 1. Although we saw a good reception for our recently launched Iridesse platform, we only had a partial quarter of benefit, and it was not enough to offset declines in other product segments, including iGen. 
Post sale declined 5% in constant currency, which was about 1 point worse than trend driven by the continuing dynamics of lower page volumes, reflecting equipment sales declines in prior quarters as well as an approximate negative 0.5 point impact from the lower licensing and prior year contract buyout I referenced earlier. Within post sale, we did see some improvement in supplies revenue, which comprised 13% of total revenue and grew outside of the OEM business. I'll wrap up revenue by highlighting that Managed Document Services grew this quarter, up 2.3%, driven specifically by growth in the SMB-focused Partner Print Services as well as from higher equipment sales.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. As stated, operating margin in the second quarter was 11.9%, an increase of 150 basis points from Q1, however, down 130 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.80, a decline of $0.06 year-over-year. As highlighted earlier, there were a few unique onetime items we're calling out as we think it is helpful to talk separately to the more operational performance and then to the truly unique items. We believe our operational performance drove an adjusted operating margin of 12.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. This reflects a decline year-over-year of 50 basis points to margin and $0.049 to EPS, driven by the impact of revenue declines, which includes ongoing price declines of an approximate 5% on equipment and low single digits on post sale as well as a less favorable margin mix of revenues as described earlier. These factors were only partially offset by the positive impact of cost savings and currency. 
In terms of unique onetime items in the quarter, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: $13 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the consolidation of real estate in Rochester. This had a 52 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.036 impact to EPS. As of June 30, this accelerated depreciation has been fully recognized. In addition, there was a $7 million IT project write-off, which had a 28 basis point impact to margin and a negative $0.019 impact to EPS. 
Partially offsetting these impacts was a noncore asset sale of $16 million. This came through other expenses net so had no impact on margin, but was a boost to EPS of $0.044. 
For the second half of the year, we're not giving specific guidance on margin as we continue to build out the plan to support the priorities John highlighted. That said, it is correct to take away from our discussion that the focus on improving profitability is very high, and we expect higher margins from this business over time. Operating cash flow was a source of $235 million in the quarter, and we are at $451 million through the first half while free cash flow was a source of $203 million in Q2 and $401 million for the half. 
Cash flow is priority 1 to the business, and I'd like to take a minute to cover our results through 6 months. Working capital has been a use of $93 million through 6 months driven by timing of payments and includes $38 million of transaction and related payments. A great emphasis is being placed on improving all the cash conversion cycle pillars to drive even greater cash efficiency. 
Finance receivables have been a source of $149 million through 6 months, which compares to $167 million for the same period last year. Typically, finance receivables are a higher source in the first half given the seasonality of revenues, but this is an area where we would trade it, being less of a source for higher equipment sales. Pension contributions are $75 million through 6 months while restructuring payments are $91 million. Our guidance was for $200 million for the full year for each of these areas. Pension contributions are running under that amount so there could be an opportunity to do better there while restructuring payments will likely not be an opportunity given the greater focus on productivity. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $32 million and is at $50 million through 6 months. This is an area where we are placing greater scrutiny and could be an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. 
In summary, the first half cash flow performance puts us well on track to maintain our full year expectations for both operating cash flow and free cash flow. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll finish by speaking to our capital structure. The second quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $265 million through the repayment of the May 2018 senior notes. We break down debt between financing and core by first calculating the finance debt by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our financing assets, finance receivables and other equipment on operating leases with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business. In Q2, this calculation resulted in an assumed financing debt of $3.5 billion and core debt of $1.7 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million unfunded pension liabilities which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
Before turning it back to John, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about guidance. As you just heard from John, we are confident in our business as demonstrated by a reiteration of our cash flow guidance and the resumption of our share repurchase program. We will be driving improvement in all financial measures. And with 75% of our business recurring in nature, we expect results will follow recent trends. However, we want to be sure we are making decisions for longer-term sustainability and hence, won't be giving specific near-term guidance -- think balance of the year, outside of cash flow. We will be providing additional details on financial expectations for the business during an Analyst Day in late 2018 or early 2019. 
I'll now turn it back to John for some concluding comments."

If you think of -- if I look at the initial perspective on the business, I see tremendous opportunity and with focus on the priorities we discussed. But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it in an operational way. Let me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end, from the manufacturing, what the costs are, to the development of it, to what's the value to the client, to how do you maintain it and how you ship it. And something as simple as if you can manufacture and ship a box under 45 pounds, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having 2 people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently. Today, as an example, we have 1,400 IT applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution? And our job is to identify all these issues in our processes so we can drive a clear end-to-end accountability for decision-making and financial performance."

We think that the share repurchase is a clear indication of that confidence in the business and that we believe that our current stock price does not reflect its true value of the company. We're driving for improvement on all measures, not just the cash flow measure. And as you know, 75% of our revenues are recurring in nature. And thus, you wouldn't expect our results to differ significantly from recent trends overall. And specifically, I know you understand that we're early in the new leadership here at Xerox, and we're specifically looking at all things. And we're making decisions for the longer term on sustainability. But our overall commitment is to do what's best for Xerox and that won't be measured by the next 3 to 6 months of an adjusted EPS number. With that said, we do believe that the cash flow guidance does provide some guide rails as far as overall expectations on where we'd be for the rest of the year. A few things to think about when you look back last year's results, obviously, Q4 will be a tougher compare versus Q3. There was some onetime items you can go back to, specifically looking at what we reported last year in Q3 and Q4, which is calling out like a headwind in Q3 would be -- there was a Grenoble technology sale that created about a $0.09 headwind, there was a lower tax rate during Q3 of last year, to do some tax reserve adjustments that took place. But overall, then you look at just seasonality of the business is still true no matter what. Q3 tends to have lower operating margins than Q4. And then I guess I'm trying to think through these things. Finally, on share repurchase. People can model through the impact, but we don't expect much of an impact in Q1. There could be up to $0.05 or so potentially, depending if you go to the higher end of the range, it'd be up to $500 million in Q4. And those are sort of things at a higher level to give some context on year-over-year thinking."

New business signings, which are really the -- all signings are important, but it's critical to say that new business signings were actually up 2% during the quarter. Renewals are somewhat can be lumpy in nature, depending on what is the opportunity and what's available. And actually, the amount that came up for renewal during the quarter had a fair amount of impact. There was just less coming up in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. But renewals were down. And part of that was also due to the win rate. Percentage was clearly lower than our targeted 90% plus win rate and lower than our prior year win rate. We were at about year 75%. But really that was driven by 2 larger enterprise deals. And so like I said, there's lumpiness and there's also just large deals can drive that percentage from quarter-to-quarter.

For myself as well as many of us on the call, we've heard this many, many, many times in the past. So can you help us understand about really what's new or what you found that has prevented this from happening because it feels like a little bit of a broken record? And then my follow-up question is on the renewal rate of 75%. That seems actually counter to your prepared comments of the great relationships you have and the need and the value that Xerox is providing because a renewal rate of 75% is not overly encouraging. So can you help us bridge the gap of those prepared comments and kind of what we're seeing in maybe just a matter of time or timing, but something just I'm not grasping there."

We've talked to a lot of clients, talked to a lot of partners. And what came out was a common theme: one, they want us to win; two, they like the products we have. As we look inside of our own technologies and our own innovations, the questions that they were asking us is how do you take this to market faster and how do we help you take it to market faster? So we have existing products today that go through our channels, go through our different channels. But how do you take other products, whether it's a new technology that you are -- that you have in your innovation, those are some of the best-kept secrets out there in the industry. So as recently as a few days ago, I spoke to a very high-level executive in a financial organization and just took them through some of the offerings we have over and above what we offer today, the MDS, the services. And we're going to do an Innovation Day with their team. And this is in a competitive environment. So it's a non-Xerox account. And they want to see. Because most of our clients are asking us, tell us what we don't know. You have these great products. But what else do you have? And that's where I got excited when asked, ""Hey, John. What's different when I got here?"" That's one of the areas that's different, is that our innovation assets are much better than I even assumed when I was looking at it. But how do we get it to market faster? And that's part of getting it to market faster. It's not just what we have today, but a lot more. How do we capitalize on that? We have tremendous assets like DocuShare, whether it's XMPie. These are game changers for clients. How do we assure ourselves that we use our go-to-market and our channels to help us get that to clients faster."

There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming on board that there has been even more. It's -- John said in his comments, maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that. We're comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided originally that we're reiterating, that we provided originally in January. As far as the working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, day sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we're working to improve all of those significantly. Even though we had originally planned that -- it's just that the need to actually -- those will make it even better, I guess, I would view it from a cash flows perspective that if you look at where we're at year-to-date on cash flows, we're already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest, that improvements in working capital, additional improvements will only help us and give us upside. It's really my perspective on that. From an MDS perspective, don't like to start going to the months. As we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months within a quarter. With that said, overall, MDS was up 2.3%. MDS revenues, 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MDS. The channels or the SMB part of the business continues to be strong. It's growing double digits -- digits again and up 14.4% in MDS revenues. And enterprise, still continues to be -- it's more competitive, more mature market. It was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MDS. And we expect to continue to be that. The 2 larger deals we lost during the quarter, we're not happy about. But overall, over the longer term, we're still expecting to be strong in MDS."

We are progressing on our priorities to optimize our operations for greater simplicity and reenergize our innovation engine while focusing on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns. In the quarter, we delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and a strong cash flow that is enabling us to raise our full-year cash flow expectations for 2018. 
Work remains on all fronts. However, clearly our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort. We were disappointed in the revenue in Q3. We have an action plan to improve revenue that includes, among other things, simplifying the organizational structure, improving alignment of compensation and evaluating contracts that are not profitable. We will go through each of the priorities in more detail, but I will start with a closer look at our results. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4.7% at constant currency, with equipment revenue performing better, down 2.7%, while post sales declined 5.2%. Both A4 and A3 equipment revenue grew at a constant currency, up 9% and 1%, respectively, showing the continued momentum from our ConnectKey products. 
While high-end declined 5%, we did improve from Q2, and we saw good market demand for our new Iridesse printing press. Iridesse hits a sweet spot within the high-end market, enabling both better productivity with a single pass technology and differentiation with the gold, silver, white and clear dry ink capabilities. 
Post sales will take time to improve. We need to build back our machines in field after ceding share for multiple quarters, leading up to the ConnectKey launch, and penetrate further our offerings into our customer base. 
Operating margin of 13.1% in the quarter increased sequentially 120 basis points and 100 basis points year-over-year driven in part by our work to simplify our business, reduce management layers and eliminate resources in areas where capacity or scales were suboptimal. 
Overall adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 reflected the work of the team. Operating profit increased as margin expansion, including the impact of higher equity income more than offset the revenue declines. A higher tax rate and lower gains on asset sales, however, resulted in a year-over-year EPS decline. On a GAAP basis, earnings declined to a greater, driven by a onetime noncash Tax Act-related true-up. 
On cash, we delivered $274 million in operating cash flow and $251 million in free cash flow, an increase of $157 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis for both measures. This strength, as highlighted, gives us confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion versus the previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, we are delivering on our commitment to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the end of September, we repurchased 284 million in shares and distributed $204 million in dividends, which in the aggregate, represents approximately 75% of September year-to-date free cash flow. 
With the strength of our cash flow and our significant cash balance of over $1 billion, along with our continued view that repurchasing our stock provides an attractive ROI, we are increasing our 2018 share repurchase expectations. We now expect to opportunistically repurchase up to $700 million from up to $500 million. This will put us well above the commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we launched project Own It, which is focused on simplifying the business to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed, accountability, end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus accountability and effectiveness. This will deliver superior customer experience while setting the company up for growth. In Q3, we identified the actions and work streams while also capturing some early wins. 
Optimization actions will expand in Q4 as we completely Own It design phase for initiatives, such as establishing more effective shared services centers, rationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base. And this is why the experience of key hires with expertise in these areas will be instrumental in driving change, leveraging strategies proven out in other enterprises. Establishing effective shared services centers is one example of an opportunity to improve the way we work to create an agile, frictionless business that delivers enhanced performance for our customers. 
Xerox has moved some functions to lower-cost locations in the past. However, we see significant potential in creating world-class Centers of Excellence, which will result in greater qualities, speed and productivity. We will do this by measuring and improving year-over-year performance through the introduction of standardized processes and metrics, automation, realtime analytics and robotics process automation will be another key strategy to drive efficiency and quality. 
RPA will be embedded in our new design as we simplify and build new end-to-end processes. For instance, RPA can be used in our order-to-cash process to validate data quality as well as scan, post-and match purchase orders and invoiced processing. 
Through all of these, we are also looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our business through simplification. An example of this is our initiative to rationalize our number of SKUs and product offerings with a goal of eliminating numerous configurations of essentially the same product and by employing a better design for efficiency through an increased number of common parts. 
The focus of our optimization efforts is on delivering greater customer value and translating actions into profitable revenue growth. We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structures and include further expanding our channel presence, including independent dealer coverage to go after the SMB market, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities. This is an area where we will be making investments and changes, including investment in our partner e-commerce portal for order management, inventory availability, shipping status and much more functionality that makes it easier for partners and our end customers. We will also invest and grow our direct e-commerce portal for product information, order placement and shipping status. 
Leveraging more digital demand generation and inside sales lead generation to help capture new customers will be key as well as improving deal pricing and contracting while turning around unprofitable contracts. 
In addition to drive long-term growth, we need to increase our focus on software innovation to deliver differentiated value to our customers and expand into adjacent markets. 
Changing the top line trends won't happen overnight, but we have the products, innovation, the talent and the customer relationships to do it. We are early in our Own It initiative, and we expect momentum to build over time.
We had some notable recent achievements that will help build the foundation for better future revenue performance, including becoming the first and only MPS vendor to receive security authorization for cloud-based managed print services from the U.S. government. This is a significant accomplishment that sets Xerox apart from our peers and allows federal agencies to utilize Xerox for services without going through a lengthy security vetting process. Security is one of the biggest concerns for corporate America, and receiving FedRAMP helps not only penetrate the nearly $100 billion annual federal IT market, but it is also a validation of our leading-edge security capabilities that companies of all size are looking for. 
Additionally, we further solidified our leadership in MPS, achieving for the ninth straight year the #1 position in Quocirca's worldwide MPS Market Landscape Report. This will continue to provide us the runway to gain wallet share, enabling expansion into digital workflow services which can help business drive further efficiency and productivity improvement. 
At the beginning of October, we announced further enhancements to our ConnectKey software, and we launched an embedded e-commerce platform that will allow us and our partners to monetize apps more easily. As I [indiscernible] with customers, I have seen the unique ways in which the ConnectKey software and apps are positively contributing to their business. 
For instance, one design and engineering company saved 25% by automating a document-laden process, accelerating the speed at which products get out the door. 
We also expanded our App Gallery. We populated with apps such as those that can support the K-12 education center by taking time-consuming tasks while grading tests and proofreading papers away from teachers, thereby allowing them to focus on students. 
In the high-end graphic communication area, we had a strong showing at the recent Print 18 Trade Show. We came away with 11 show awards, including a Vanguard award for the new Iridesse Production Press and 5 awards [indiscernible] game changer. It is the only digital [indiscernible] software. The new print in 1 [indiscernible] with 6 colors, including gold, silver, white and clear dry ink. This allows our customers and partners to perform the same task at pennies of the cost of having to run multiple machine passes and offset processes. This opens up a huge opportunity for Xerox and our print provider customers in the lucrative print embellishment market and supports the movements of more pages from offset into our digital space. 
It is also driving new business for us. In our international operations, over 50% of our installs are new placements, generating new print volume. And 90% of our Iridesse customers invested in the optional specialty dry ink print station to capture new applications with gold, silver, clear or white to grow their business. As one customer indicated, this press gives possibilities like no other digital printer on the market. 
As we previously communicated, we are revamping our innovation business model. This is essential to returning Xerox to technology leadership, positioning us for the long-term success and ensuring profitable monetization of our innovation. We have begun a thorough review of our software businesses to consider how we can better position them for growth, both as part of our core document business and on a standalone basis. We are examining our [indiscernible] investment in [indiscernible] and inkjet to ensure that we maintain technology leadership and that we have the best approach to realize the high rates of return we require. 
Our leading expertise in technology in printing uniquely positions us to move into adjacencies that share similar core technology requirements. For instance, we are developing a road map to participate in 3D printing. We currently manufacture 3D print ads that we OEM, where we have differentiated capabilities around print technologies, materials, toner and software that will enable 3D printing to move to the next level of adoption for the production of end-use industrial parts. 
We are also accelerating market growth in emerging innovation areas to more quickly decide whether and how to incubate and scale opportunities for monetization. One example of this is the work we are doing around smart tags and printed electronics. This revolutionary technology has the potential to change how we store, sense, compute and communicate information. Real-world applications would include cold chain monitoring to ensure food traceability or to smart mouthguard that athletes could wear to monitor their health and fitness. This is just one of the ways we are looking to extend our existing IP to bring disruptive technologies into new industries. 
When appropriate, we will invest in our capabilities as well as an M&A to revitalize process to enable commercialization of the technologies we create. A recent highlight where we have not only ramped up the visibility of an offering, but also honed our market positioning, is the latest version of DocuShare Flex 2.5. DocuShare historically has been an asset that was underappreciated within the corporate complex and thus, not optimally distributed. DocuShare Flex 2.5 helps companies solve their document-intensive workflow and file management challenges through a flexible cloud-based solution. Key upgrades include more seamless integration with the commonly used applications such as Salesforce [indiscernible] solutions to streamline accounts [indiscernible] receivable as well as enhanced mobile capabilities. 
There is a lot of excitement amongst the Xerox team around our innovation opportunities. We look forward to better capitalizing our innovation capabilities and investments to capture the full value of this critical element of our business strategy. 
A top priority is making sure we have strong sustainable cash flow generation. In conjunction with our Own It initiatives, we are focused on improving our cash flow model through Seito management and improving the net working capital pillars. 
Cash flow was very positive in Q3. During the quarter, we implemented tighter controls around working capital. From this increased focus, we grew cash flow $157 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year, and as a result, we're increasing our full year free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion from our previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
We know it is very important to effectively deploy cash to provide good returns to our shareholders both through improving our profit trajectory organically and inorganically as well as through direct returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the quarter, we began to work to rebuild our M&A pipeline and to begin to frame out the investments that we'll be making in the future to drive improved profitable revenue growth. 
In terms of direct returns of capital, as I indicated earlier, we repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the third quarter, which translates to approximately 10.5 million shares or 4% of shares outstanding. And given the strength of our cash profile, we are increasing our full year repurchase expectations from $500 million to $700 million opportunistically. 
We will provide further updates on our priorities during Q4 earnings in January followed by a more in-depth review of the company's strategy and the Own It program during an Analyst Day in the first 2 weeks of February of 2019. 
I will now turn it over to Bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter."

Let me start with a review of the income statement.

Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. 
Revenue, as John highlighted, clearly remains a challenge. Overall, revenue declined 4.7% at constant currency while actual currency was down 5.8%. Currency went from being a benefit of about 2 points last quarter to now a headwind of approximately 1 point. 
Within revenue, we had growth in workplace, A3 and A4 equipment and overall, equipment revenue would have grown 1.7% at constant currency if it had not been for the impact of lower OEM sales. 
Post sale, however, continues to be pressured. Specifically, we saw weaker supply sales as well as a slowdown in Managed Print Services post sale. I'll spend more time on these dynamics when I cover the revenue slide. However, as noted last quarter, to stabilize revenue, we need our market share and placement growth to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines and field and page volumes to help improve trends in post sale. 
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 13.1% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. The improvement came from a 40 basis point improvement in our SG&A ratio, driven by actions to reduce expansion layers and gain greater efficiency in our operations. 
Gross margin of 40.1% was flat year-over-year. A good result is the impact of higher revenue declines was offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including greater price discipline and controls. 
From a stream perspective, we saw positive mix within equipment from lower OEM sales where we lose money on the upfront sale. While within post sale, mix was a negative factor given the higher declines in supplies. 
Also contributing to the improvement in margin was higher equity income, which increased $14 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Drivers of the equity income improvement include benefits to the Fuji Xerox from their recent cost actions as well as an easier compare given prior year higher bad debt provisions. 
Turning to below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $24 million were $7 million worse year-over-year, driven by lower gains on asset sales as the prior year included a $13 million gain associated with the sale of our Grenoble Research center. 
Adjusted tax rate of 24.5% increased 5.2 points year over year, resulting in a negative $0.05 impact EPS as the prior year rate was lower from a tax reserve reversal. 
Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.85 was down $0.04 from the third quarter of 2017, driven by the higher tax rate. 
On a GAAP basis, we had $0.34 of earnings per share, which was down $0.33 in the quarter, driven by a $0.37 or $95 million noncash charge associated with the change in the provisional estimated impact from the U.S. Tax Act, which was partially offset by $0.09 or $33 million in transaction and related cost reversals versus. 
The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox, nonservice retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets as well as the aforementioned transaction cost reversal and U.S. Tax Act charge.
Moving on to revenue, where I'll break down our revenue decline of 4.7% at constant currency. Looking first at the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 4.2% at constant currency, with equipment revenue flat, driven by good growth in enterprise. Post sale in North America, however, was pressured with higher supplies and Managed Document Services declines year-over-year. International declined 2% at constant currency, an improvement over the 3.9% decline in Q2, driven by growth in equipment. Within international operations, we continued to see growth in developing markets, while Europe's rate of decline improved sequentially. Our highest area of decline was in Other, driven by the OEM business which has an overall negative 1 point impact to total revenue. 
Turning now to a closer look at equipment revenue. Equipment revenue declined 2.7% at constant currency. However, as highlighted earlier, it grew 1.7%, excluding OEM. 
Entry equipment revenue made up 11% of equipment and was up 9.1% at constant currency, driven by growth in developing markets and U.S. channels. 
From a product perspective. Black and white entry A4 products continues to show strong growth while color multifunction installs declined. 
Midrange equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 1% in constant currency. Areas of growth included U.S. enterprise, driven by large account sales and continued growth across developing markets. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Europe, reflecting in part a more challenging compare given higher channel purchases in the prior year associated with the building of sufficient supply of newly-launched products. 
Install growth in midrange overall outpaced revenue, driven by a mix towards mono and lower-end color devices in part from the better  in developing markets where installs wait to the lower end. 
Midrange A3 is a key leadership segment for Xerox and overall, it is midrange that has driven our equipment revenue share gains over the past 3 quarters. We have not yet gotten back the [indiscernible] ConnectKey launch so growth needs to continue to get higher myths and drive post sale improvement. 
Lastly, our results in the high end were very mixed. High-end equipment revenue made up 18% of total equipment revenue and the decline improved sequentially, down 5.1% at constant currency versus down 9.9% in Q2. We saw strong demand for our new Iridesse press that exceeded our expectations. However, this growth was not enough to offset the impact of the lapping of the Versant product launch and declines in iGen. 
Turning to post sale. Post sale revenue comprised 78% of total revenue and declined 5.2% at constant currency. As discussed earlier, we have not seen the contracted post sale revenue trend improve, which is dependent on growing our machines and field and page volumes. And in the third quarter, we also experienced higher unbundled supplies revenue declines which went from down 2.4% June year to date to down 7.7% in Q3. The supplies declines were driven by lower indirect channel sales, which were impacted by lower demand, including large customer order timing and economic uncertainty in certain developing market countries. 
To close on revenue. Managed Document Services comprised 36% of total revenue and continued to grow, up 0.9% at constant currency. This was a deceleration from the second quarter growth of 2.3%, driven by the impact of lower renewables in prior periods as well as timing of new business ramp. Positives within Managed Document Services include continued growth in partner print services to the SMB market as well as a second straight quarter of new business signings growth and a 4 point sequential improvement in the renewal rate to 79%. Renewal rate, however, was below our target of 85% to 90%. In overall, our renewal signings were lower than the prior year and drove a total signings decline of 2.8% at constant currency. 
As John indicated, we need to leverage our strong market position and new accreditations like FedRAMP to drive improving results in the segment of the market. 
Looking forward, we are not giving specific revenue guidance. However, I would like to highlight that as indicated earlier, it will take time before we see revenue begin to improve. And secondly, although we expect to see improvement in some areas such as supplies, overall, the fourth quarter compare is the most difficult of the year considering the timing last year's ConnectKey product launch.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox's profitability performance. Operating margin of 13.1% increased 100 basis points year-over-year, while adjusted EPS of $0.85 declined $0.04 year-over-year. Overall, we viewed both operating margin and earnings per share as positives in the quarter. 
Looking at the profitability walk year-over-year. Within our operations, the impact of revenue declines were only partially offset by cost productivity benefits, resulting in a negative $0.02 year-over-year impact to EPS. However, our operations did drive a 40 basis point improvement in margin as we reduced costs at a higher rate than revenue decline. The remaining 60 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income that I highlighted earlier. This increase also was an approximate $0.05 benefit to EPS. 
In terms of unique items in the year-over-year quarter compare, there were 3 that we believe to be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: a year-over-year negative impact of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per share associated with the gain we realized last year on the sale of our Grenoble Research Center; a $0.05 negative impact associated with a higher adjusted tax rate in Q3 2018 of 24.5% compared to a 19.3% tax rate in the prior year when we benefited from the conclusion of several audits. Partially offsetting these impacts was an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower shares, driven by the resumption of our share repurchases during the quarter. The benefit is not higher as we only realized a partial quarter of the lower shares, as well shares have modestly grown since the prior year compensation. So good results on profitability. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a source of $274 million in the quarter and we are at $725 million through 9 months while free cash flow was a source of $251 million in Q3 and $652 million year to date. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up $157 million year-over-year in the quarter on an adjusted basis. Adjusting for the $500 million in incremental pension contributions and the GAAP change this year that require the reporting of deferred proceeds and beneficial interest from sales and receivables in investing cash flows instead of operating. 
September year-to-date operating cash flow is up $85 million and free cash flow is up $82 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. So overall, very positive results. 
I'll now take a few minutes to highlight some of the year-over-year drivers in the quarter. Working capital was a use of $47 million in the quarter, an improvement of $32 million over last year, driven by an improvement in inventories from improved supply demand process as compared to the prior year when we experienced inventory buildups associated with the ConnectKey product launch. 
Finance receivables were a source of $39 million in the quarter compared to a source of $75 million last year. So although it was not as big a help to cash flow, as indicated last quarter, this is an area where we would trade at being less of a source for higher equipment sales. 
Pension contributions were $36 million this quarter which compared to $671 million in the prior year when we made the incremental $500 million in contributions. Adjusting for the $500 million, pension contributions were lower by $135 million. So positive year-over-year contributor then more than offset the lower source from finance receivables. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $23 million and a $73 million year-to-date. This is an area, as highlighted last quarter, where we were placing greater scrutiny, and we now expect CapEx for the year to be approximately $100 million versus the previous guidance of $150 million. 
To conclude, this solid cash flow performance gives us the confidence to increase our full-year cash flow guidance, narrowing our operating cash flow to the high end of the range. So now we expect $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and narrowing and increasing our free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion, which also incorporates the lower CapEx expectations. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll speak to our capital structure. The third quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We break down the debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, finance receivables and equipment operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of the core business. In Q3, this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.4 billion and core debt of $1.8 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
To wrap up, we saw progress in the quarter across our profitability and cash flow measures and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Project Own It will drive long-term sustainable improvement across the business. And although revenue will be challenged in the near term, there are detailed actions underway to improve that trend over time. 
I'll now turn it back over to John for some concluding comments."

I would say that in recent months, there is clearly a lot more scrutiny.

But there is clearly -- so making sure that all the arrangements that we're entering into are profitable not only in the initial year but over the life of the arrangement. As far as the post sale and the shrinking installed base, I first like to say that the new product launch that we did last year is having an impact to offset to get back the machines and field that we had lost in anticipation of that product launch. We're not fully back to where we were since the beginning of machines and field in the beginning of 2017, but we certainly have made progress with our ESR in recent quarters. There is also an impact from page volume declines, smaller impact. But the big thing for us is to get those machines in field continue with strong ESR we have seen in recent quarters."

We are progressing on our priorities to optimize our operations for greater simplicity and reenergize our innovation engine while focusing on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns. In the quarter, we delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and a strong cash flow that is enabling us to raise our full year cash flow expectations for 2018. 
Work remains on all fronts. However, clearly, our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort. We were disappointed in the revenue in Q3. We have an action plan to improve revenue that includes, among other things, simplifying the organizational structure, improving alignment of compensation and evaluating contracts that are not profitable. We will go through each of the priorities in more detail, but I will start with a closer look at our results. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4.7% at constant currency, with equipment revenue performing better, down 2.7%, while post sales declined 5.2%. Both A4 and A3 equipment revenue grew at constant currency, up 9% and 1%, respectively, showing the continued momentum from our ConnectKey products. 
While high end declined 5%, we did improve from Q2, and we saw good market demand for our new Iridesse printing press. Iridesse hits a sweet spot within the high-end market, enabling both better productivity with a single pass technology and differentiation with the gold, silver, white and clear dry ink capabilities. Post sales will take time to improve. We need to build back our machines in field after ceding share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch and penetrate further our offerings into our customer base. 
Operating margin of 13.1% in the quarter increased sequentially 120 basis points and 100 basis points year-over-year driven in part by our work to simplify our business, reduce management layers and eliminate resources in areas where capacity or scales were suboptimal. 
Overall adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 reflected the work of the team. Operating profit increased as margin expansion, including the impact of higher equity income, more than offset the revenue declines. A higher tax rate and lower gains on asset sales, however, resulted in a year-over-year EPS decline. On a GAAP basis, earnings declines were greater, driven by a onetime noncash tax act-related true-up. 
On cash, we delivered $274 million in operating cash flow and $251 million in free cash flow, an increase of $157 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis for both measures. This strength, as highlighted, gives us confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion versus the previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, we are delivering on our commitment to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the end of September, we repurchased $284 million in shares and distributed $204 million in dividends, which, in the aggregate, represents approximately 75% of September year-to-date free cash flow. 
With the strength of our cash flow and our significant cash balance of over $1 billion, along with our continued view that repurchasing our stock provides an attractive ROI, we are increasing our 2018 share repurchase expectations. We now expect to opportunistically repurchase up to $700 million from up to $500 million. This will put us well above the commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we launched project ""Own It,"" which is focused on simplifying the business to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed accountability and effectiveness. This will deliver superior customer experience while setting the company up for growth. In Q3, we identified the actions and work streams while also capturing some early wins. 
Optimization actions will expand in Q4 as we complete the ""Own It"" design phase for initiatives such as establishing more effective shared services centers, rationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base. And this is where the experience of key hires with expertise in these areas will be instrumental in driving change, leveraging strategies proven out in other enterprises. 
Establishing effective shared services centers is one example of an opportunity to improve the way we work to create an agile, frictionless business that delivers enhanced performance for our customers. 
Xerox has moved some functions to lower-cost locations in the past. However, we see significant potential in creating world-class centers of excellence, which will result in greater quality, speed and productivity. We will do this by measuring and improving year-over-year performance through the introduction of standardized processes and metrics. 
Automation, real-time analytics and robotics process automation will be another key strategy to drive efficiency and quality. RPA will be embedded in our new design as we simplify and build new end-to-end processes. For instance, RPA can be used in our order-to-cash process to validate data quality as well as scan, post and match purchase orders and invoice processing. 
Through all of these, we are also looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our business through simplification. An example of this is our initiative to rationalize our number of SKUs and product offerings with a goal of eliminating numerous configurations of essentially the same product and by employing a better design for efficiency through an increased number of common parts. The focus of our optimization efforts is on delivering greater customer value and translating actions into profitable revenue growth. 
We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structure and include further expanding our channel presence, including independent dealer coverage to go after the SMB market. Enhancing our e-commerce capabilities, this is an area where we will be making investments and changes, including investment in our partner e-commerce portal for order management, inventory availability, shipping status and much more functionality that makes it easier for partners and our end customers. We will also invest and grow our direct e-commerce portal for product information, order placement and shipping status. Leveraging more digital demand generation inside sales lead generation to help capture new customers will be key as well as improving deal pricing and contracting while turning around unprofitable contracts. 
In addition, to drive long-term growth, we need to increase our focus on software innovation to deliver differentiated value to our customers and expand into adjacent markets. Changing the top line trend won't happen overnight, but we have the products, the innovation, the talent and the customer relationships to do it. We are early in our ""Own It"" initiative, and we expect momentum to build over time.
We have some notable recent achievements that will help build the foundation for better future revenue performance, including becoming the first and only MPS vendor to receive security authorization for cloud-based Managed Print Services from the U.S. government. This is a significant accomplishment that sets Xerox apart from our peers and allows federal agencies to utilize Xerox for services without going through a lengthy security vetting process. Security is one of the biggest concerns for corporate America, and receiving FedRAMP helps not only penetrate the nearly $100 billion annual federal IT market but it is also a validation of our leading-edge security capabilities that companies of all size are looking for.  
Additionally, we further solidified our leadership in MPS, achieving for the ninth straight year the #1 position in Quocirca's worldwide MPS market landscape report. This will continue to provide us the runway to gain wallet share, enabling expansion into digital workflow services, which can help business drive further efficiency and productivity improvement. 
At the beginning of October, we announced further enhancements to our ConnectKey software, and we launched an embedded e-commerce platform that will allow us and our partners to monetize apps more easily. As I visit with customers, I have seen the unique ways in which the ConnectKey software and apps are positively contributing to their business. 
For instance, one design and engineering company saved 25% by automating a document-laden process, accelerating the speed at which products get out the door. 
We also expanded our App Gallery. We populate it with apps such as those that can support the K-12 education sector by taking time-consuming tasks like grading tests and proofreading papers away from teachers, thereby allowing them to focus on students. 
In the high-end graphic communication area, we had a strong showing at the recent Print 18 trade show. We came away with 11 show awards, including a Vanguard award for the new Iridesse Production Press, and 5 awards relate 
[Audio Gap] 
a game-changer. It is the only digital press 
[Audio Gap] 
software. The new 
[Audio Gap] 
print in 1 pass with 6 colors, including gold, silver, white and clear dry ink. This allows our customers and partners to perform the same task at pennies of the cost of having to run multiple machine passes and offset processes. This opens up a huge opportunity for Xerox and our print-provider customers in the lucrative print embellishment market and supports the movement of more pages from offset into our digital space. 
It is also driving new business for us. In our international operations, over 50% of our installs are new placements, generating new print volume. And 90% of our Iridesse customers invested in the optional specialty dry ink print station to capture new applications with gold, silver, clear or white to grow their business. As one customer indicated, this press gives possibilities like no other digital printer on the market. 
As we previously communicated, we are revamping our innovation business model. This is essential to returning Xerox to technology leadership, positioning us for long-term success and ensuring proper monetization of our innovation. We have begun a thorough review of our software businesses to consider how we can better position them for growth, both as part of our core document business and on a stand-alone basis. We are examining our RD&E investments in xerography and inkjet to ensure that we maintain technology leadership and that we have the best approach to realize the high rates of return we require. 
Our leading expertise in technology in printing uniquely positions us to move into adjacencies that share similar core technology requirements. For instance, we are developing a road map to participate in 3D printing. We currently manufacture 3D print ads that we OEM, where we have differentiated capabilities around print technologies, materials, toner and software that will enable 3D printing to move to the next level of adoption for the production of end-use industrial parts. 
We are also accelerating market growth in emerging innovation areas to more quickly decide whether and how to incubate and scale opportunities for monetization. One example of this is the work we are doing around smart tags and printed electronics. This revolutionary technology has the potential to change how we store, sense, compute and communicate information. Real-world applications would include cold chain monitoring to ensure food traceability or the smart mouth guard that athletes could wear to monitor their health and fitness. This is just one of the ways we are looking to extend our existing IP to bring disruptive technologies into new industries. 
When appropriate, we will invest in our capabilities as well as in M&A through a revitalized process to enable commercialization of the technologies we create. A recent highlight where we have not only ramped up the visibility of an offering but also honed our market positioning is the latest version of DocuShare Flex 2.5. DocuShare historically has been an asset that was underappreciated within the corporate complex and thus, not optimally distributed. 
DocuShare Flex 2.5 helps companies solve their document-intensive workflow and file management challenges through a flexible cloud-based solution. Key upgrades include more seamless integration with the commonly used applications such as Salesforce and doc 
[Audio Gap] 
flow solutions to streamline accounts payable and receivable as well as enhance mobile capabilities. 
There is a lot of excitement amongst the Xerox team around our innovation opportunities. We look forward to better capitalizing our innovation capabilities and investments to capture the full value of this critical element of our business strategy. 
A top priority is making sure we have strong sustainable cash flow generation. In conjunction with our ""Own It"" initiatives, we are focused on improving our cash flow model through tighter management and improving the net working capital pillars. Cash flow was very positive in Q3. During the quarter, we implemented tighter controls around working capital. From this increased focus, we grew cash flow $157 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year, and as a result, we are increasing our full year free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion from our previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
We know it is very important to effectively deploy cash to provide good returns to our shareholders, both through improving our profit trajectory organically and inorganically as well as through direct returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we began to work to rebuild our M&A pipeline and to begin to frame out the investments that we'll be making in the future to drive improved profitable revenue growth. In terms of direct returns of capital, as I indicated earlier, we repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the third quarter, which translates to approximately 10.5 million shares or 4% of shares outstanding. And given the strength of our cash profile, we are increasing our full year repurchase expectations from $500 million to $700 million opportunistically. We will provide further updates on our priorities during Q4 earnings in January followed by a more in-depth review of the company's strategy and the ""Own It"" program during an Analyst Day in the first 2 weeks of February of 2019. 
I will now turn it over to Bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter."

Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A, that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted",2195,"Thanks, John. Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A, that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. 
Revenue, as John highlighted, clearly remains a challenge. Overall, revenue declined 4.7% at constant currency while actual currency was down 5.8%. Currency went from being a benefit of about 2 points last quarter to now a headwind of approximately 1 point. Within revenue, we had growth in Workplace, A3 and A4 equipment, and overall, equipment revenue would have grown 1.7% at constant currency if it had not been for the impact of lower OEM sales. 
Post sale, however, continues to be pressured. Specifically, we saw weaker supply sales as well as a slowdown in Managed Print Services post sale. I'll spend more time on these dynamics when I cover the revenue slide. However, as noted last quarter, to stabilize revenue, we need our market share and placement growth to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and page volumes to help improve trends in post sale. 
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 13.1% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. The improvement came from a 40 basis point improvement in our SG&A ratio, driven by actions to reduce spans and layers and gain greater efficiency in our operations. Gross margin of 40.1% was flat year-over-year, a good result as the impact of higher revenue declines was offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including greater price discipline and controls. 
From a stream perspective, we saw positive mix within equipment from lower OEM sales where we lose money on the upfront sale while, within post sale, mix was a negative factor given the higher declines in supplies. Also contributing to the improvement in margin was higher equity income, which increased $14 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Drivers of the equity income improvement include benefits to Fuji Xerox from their recent cost actions as well as an easier compare given prior year higher bad debt provisions. 
Turning to below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $24 million were $7 million worse year-over-year, driven by lower gains on asset sales as the prior year included a $13 million gain associated with the sale of our Grenoble research center. Adjusted tax rate of 24.5% increased 5.2 points year over year, resulting in a negative $0.05 impact to EPS as the prior year rate was lower from a tax reserve reversal. 
Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.85 was down $0.04 from the third quarter of 2017, driven by the higher tax rate. On a GAAP basis, we had $0.34 of earnings per share, which was down $0.33 in the quarter, driven by a $0.37 or $95 million noncash charge associated with the change in the provisional estimated impact from the U.S. tax act, which was partially offset by $0.09 or $33 million in transaction and related cost reversals. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets as well as the aforementioned transaction cost reversal and U.S. tax act charge.
Moving on to revenue, where I'll break down our revenue decline of 4.7% at constant currency. Looking first at the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 4.2% at constant currency, with equipment revenue flat, driven by good growth in enterprise. Post sale in North America, however, was pressured with higher supplies and Managed Document Services declines year-over-year. 
International declined 2% at constant currency, an improvement over the 3.9% decline in Q2, driven by growth in equipment. Within international operations, we continued to see growth in developing markets while Europe's rate of decline improved sequentially. Our highest area of decline was in Other, driven by the OEM business, which had an overall negative 1 point impact to total revenue. 
Turning now to a closer look at equipment revenue. Equipment revenue declined 2.7% at constant currency. However, as highlighted earlier, it grew 1.7% excluding OEM. Entry equipment revenue made up 11% of equipment and was up 9.1% at constant currency, driven by growth in developing markets and U.S. channels. From a product perspective, black and white entry A4 products continue to show strong growth while color multifunction installs declined. 
Midrange equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 1% in constant currency. Areas of growth included U.S. enterprise, driven by large account sales, and continued growth across developing markets. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Europe, reflecting in part a more challenging compare, given higher channel purchases in the prior year associated with building up  sufficient supply of newly launched products.  Install growth in midrange overall outpaced revenue, driven by a mix towards mono and lower-end color devices, in part from the better growth in developing markets where installs weigh to the lower end. 
Midrange A3 is a key leadership segment for Xerox, and overall, it is midrange that has driven our equipment revenue share gains over the past 3 quarters. We have not yet gotten back the MIF lost prior to the ConnectKey launch, so growth needs to continue to get higher MIF and drive post sale improvement. 
Lastly, our results in the high end were very mixed. High-end equipment revenue made up 18% of total equipment revenue, and the decline improved sequentially, down 5.1% at constant currency versus down 9.9% in Q2. We saw strong demand for our new Iridesse press that exceeded our expectations. However, this growth was not enough to offset the impact of the lapping of the Versant product launch and declines in iGen. 
Turning to post sale. Post sale revenue comprised 78% of total revenue and declined 5.2% at constant currency. As discussed earlier, we have not seen the contracted post sale revenue trend improve, which is dependent on growing our machines in field and page volumes. And in the third quarter, we also experienced higher unbundled supplies revenue declines, which went from down 2.4% June year-to-date to down 7.7% in Q3. The supplies declines were driven by lower indirect channel sales, which were impacted by lower demand, including large customer order timing and economic uncertainty in certain developing market countries. 
To close on revenue, Managed Document Services comprised 36% of total revenue and continued to grow, up 0.9% at constant currency. This was a deceleration from the second quarter growth of 2.3%, driven by the impact of lower renewables in prior periods as well as timing of new business ramp. Positives within Managed Document Services include continued growth in partner print services to the SMB market as well as a second straight quarter of new business signings growth and a 4-point sequential improvement in the renewal rate to 79%. Renewal rate, however, was below our target of 85% to 90%, and overall renewal signings were lower than the prior year and drove a total signings decline of 2.8% at constant currency. As John indicated, we need to leverage our strong market position and new accreditations like FedRAMP to drive improving results in this segment of the market. 
Looking forward, we are not giving specific revenue guidance. However, I would like to highlight that, as indicated earlier, it will take time before we see revenue begin to improve. And secondly, although we expect to see improvement in some areas such as supplies, overall, the fourth quarter compare is the most difficult of the year, considering the timing of last year's ConnectKey product launch.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. Operating margin of 13.1% increased 100 basis points year-over-year while adjusted EPS of $0.85 declined $0.04 year-over-year. Overall, we view both operating margin and earnings per share as positives in the quarter. 
Looking at the profitability walk year-over-year. Within our operations, the impact of revenue declines were only partially offset by cost productivity benefits, resulting in a negative $0.02 year-over-year impact to EPS. However, our operations did drive a 40 basis point improvement in margin as we reduced costs at a higher rate than revenue decline. The remaining 60 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income that I highlighted earlier. This increase also was an approximate $0.05 benefit to EPS. 
In terms of unique items in the year-over-year quarter compare, there were 3 that we believe to be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: a year-over-year negative impact of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per share associated with the gain we realized last year on the sale of our Grenoble research center; a $0.05 negative impact associated with a higher adjusted tax rate in Q3 2018 of 24.5% compared to a 19.3% tax rate in the prior year when we benefited from the conclusion of several audits. Partially offsetting these impacts was an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower shares, driven by the resumption of our share repurchases during the quarter. The benefit is not higher as we only realized a partial quarter of lower shares. As well, shares had modestly grown since the prior year from compensation. So good results on profitability. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a source of $274 million in the quarter and we are at $725 million through 9 months while free cash flow was a source of $251 million in Q3 and $652 million year-to-date. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up $157 million year-over-year in the quarter on an adjusted basis, adjusting for the $500 million in incremental pension contributions and the GAAP change this year that required the reporting of deferred proceeds and beneficial interest from sales and receivables in investing cash flows instead of operating. September year-to-date operating cash flow is up $85 million and free cash flow is up $82 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. So overall, very positive results. 
I'll now take a few minutes to highlight some of the year-over-year drivers in the quarter. Working capital was a use of $47 million in the quarter, an improvement of $32 million over last year, driven by an improvement in inventories from improved supply demand process as compared to the prior year when we experienced inventory buildups associated with the ConnectKey product launch. 
Finance receivables were a source of $39 million in the quarter compared to a source of $75 million last year. So although it was not as big a help to cash flow, as indicated last quarter, this is an area where we would trade it being less of a source for higher equipment sales. 
Pension contributions were $36 million this quarter, which compare to $671 million in the prior year when we made the incremental $500 million in contributions. Adjusting for the $500 million, pension contributions were lower by $135 million, so a positive year-over-year contributor that more than offset the lower source from finance receivables. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $23 million and $73 million year-to-date. This is an area, as highlighted last quarter, where we are placing greater scrutiny. And we now expect CapEx for the year to be approximately $100 million versus the previous guidance of $150 million. To conclude, this solid cash flow performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year cash flow guidance, narrowing our operating cash flow to the high end of the range, so now we expect $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion of operating cash flow; and narrowing and increasing our free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion, which also incorporates the lower CapEx expectations. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll speak to our capital structure. The third quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We break down the debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, finance receivables and equipment operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of the core business. In Q3, this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.4 billion and core debt of $1.8 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compare to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
To wrap up, we saw progress in the quarter across our profitability and cash flow measures and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Project ""Own It"" will drive long-term sustainable improvement across the business. And although revenue will be challenged in the near term, there are detailed actions underway to improve that trend over time. 
I'll now turn it back over to John for some concluding comments."

I would say that in recent months, there is clearly a lot more scrutiny. We're looking for strong margins throughout the life of longer-term, 4-, 5-year MDS arrangements and just making sure that from the get-go, the initial year and over the life of the contract, that there's an appropriate amount of margin on those contracts. To say -- have we lost any specific contracts because of that or not? That's really hard to tell. But there is clearly an emphasis on making sure that all the arrangements that we're entering into are profitable not only in the initial year but over the life of the arrangement. As far as the post sale and the shrinking installed base, I'd first like to say that the new product launch that we did last year is having an impact to offset, to get back the machines in field that we had lost in anticipation of that product launch. We're not fully back to where we were since the beginning -- on machines in field in the beginning of 2017, but we certainly have made progress with our ESR in recent quarters. There is also an impact from page volume declines, a smaller impact. But the big thing for us is to get those machines in field continue with strong ESR we've seen in recent quarters."

And we saw improvements there when you compare the third quarter this year to the working capital impact in the third quarter of last year. And then lastly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a CapEx perspective, we're not a very CapEx-intensive company, but a lot would be in the IT spend area.

And we're just being more careful, in particular, at making sure that we're spending those dollars in the right area where we'll get a payback on them, and right now, we're estimating that we'll be about $50 million less or about $100 million for the year on CapEx."

We are progressing on our priorities to optimize our operations for greater simplicity and reenergize our innovation engine while focusing on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns. In the quarter, we delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and a strong cash flow that is enabling us to raise our full year cash flow expectations for 2018. 
Work remains on all fronts. However, clearly, our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort. We were disappointed in the revenue in Q3. We have an action plan to improve revenue that includes, among other things, simplifying the organizational structure, improving alignment of compensation and evaluating contracts that are not profitable. We will go through each of the priorities in more detail, but I will start with a closer look at our results. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4.7% at constant currency, with equipment revenue performing better, down 2.7%, while post sales declined 5.2%. Both A4 and A3 equipment revenue grew at a constant currency, up 9% and 1%, respectively, showing the continued momentum from our ConnectKey products. 
While high end declined 5%, we did improve from Q2, and we saw good market demand for our new Iridesse printing press. Iridesse hits a sweet spot within the high-end market, enabling both better productivity with a single pass technology and differentiation with its gold, silver, white and clear dry ink capabilities. Post sales will take time to improve. We need to build back our machines in field after ceding share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch and penetrate further our offerings into our customer base. 
Operating margin of 13.1% in the quarter increased sequentially 120 basis points and 100 basis points year-over-year, driven in part by our work to simplify our business, reduce management layers and eliminate resources in areas where capacity or skills were suboptimal. 
Overall adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 reflected the work of the team. Operating profit increased as margin expansion, including the impact of higher equity income, more than offset the revenue declines. A higher tax rate and lower gains on asset sales, however, resulted in a year-over-year EPS decline. On a GAAP basis, earnings declines were greater, driven by a onetime noncash tax act-related true-up. 
On cash, we delivered $274 million in operating cash flow and $251 million in free cash flow, an increase of $157 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis for both measures. This strength, as highlighted, gives us confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion versus the previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, we are delivering on our commitment to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the end of September, we repurchased $284 million in shares and distributed $204 million in dividends, which, in the aggregate, represents approximately 75% of September year-to-date free cash flow. 
With the strength of our cash flow and our significant cash balance of over $1 billion, along with our continued view that repurchasing our stock provides an attractive ROI, we are increasing our 2018 share repurchase expectations. We now expect to opportunistically repurchase up to $700 million from up to $500 million. This will put us well above the commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we launched project ""Own It,"" which is focused on simplifying the business to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed accountability and effectiveness. This will deliver a superior customer experience while setting the company up for growth. In Q3, we identified the actions and work streams while also capturing some early wins. 
Optimization actions will expand in Q4 as we complete the ""Own It"" design phase for initiatives such as establishing more effective shared services centers, rationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base. And this is where the experience of key hires with expertise in these areas will be instrumental in driving change, leveraging strategies proven out in other enterprises. 
Establishing effective shared services centers is one example of an opportunity to improve the way we work to create an agile, frictionless business that delivers enhanced performance for our customers. 
Xerox has moved some functions to lower-cost locations in the past. However, we see significant potential in creating world-class centers of excellence, which will result in greater quality, speed and productivity. We will do this by measuring and improving year-over-year performance through the introduction of standardized processes and metrics. 
Automation, real-time analytics and robotics process automation will be another key strategy to drive efficiency and quality. RPA will be embedded in our new design as we simplify and build new end-to-end processes. For instance, RPA can be used in our order-to-cash process to validate data quality as well as scan, post and match purchase orders and invoice processing. 
Through all of this, we are also looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our business through simplification. An example of this is our initiative to rationalize our number of SKUs and product offerings with a goal of eliminating numerous configurations of essentially the same product and by employing a better design for efficiency through an increased number of common parts. The focus of our optimization efforts is on delivering greater customer value and translating actions into profitable revenue growth. 
We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structure and include further expanding our channel presence, including independent dealer coverage to go after the SMB market. Enhancing our e-commerce capabilities, this is an area where we will be making investments and changes, including investment in our partner e-commerce portals for order management, inventory availability, shipping status and much more functionality that makes it easier for partners and our end customers. We will also invest and grow our direct e-commerce portal for product information, order placement and shipping status. Leveraging more digital demand generation inside sales lead generation to help capture new customers will be key, as well as improving deal pricing and contracting while turning around unprofitable contracts. 
In addition, to drive long-term growth, we need to increase our focus on software innovation to deliver differentiated value to our customers and expand into adjacent markets. Changing the top line trends won't happen overnight, but we have the products, the innovation, the talent and the customer relationships to do it. We are early in our ""Own It"" initiative, and we expect momentum to build over time.
We have some notable recent achievements that will help build the foundation for better future revenue performance, including becoming the first and only MPS vendor to receive security authorization for cloud-based Managed Print Services from the U.S. government. This is a significant accomplishment that sets Xerox apart from our peers and allows federal agencies to utilize Xerox for services without going through a lengthy security vetting process. Security is one of the biggest concerns for corporate America, and receiving FedRAMP helps not only penetrate the nearly $100 billion annual federal IT market but it is also a validation of our leading-edge security capabilities that companies of all size are looking for.  
Additionally, we further solidified our leadership in MPS, achieving for the ninth straight year the #1 position in Quocirca's worldwide MPS market landscape report. This will continue to provide us the runway to gain wallet share, enabling expansion into digital workflow services, which can help business drive further efficiency and productivity improvement. 
At the beginning of October, we announced further enhancements to our ConnectKey software, and we launched an embedded e-commerce platform that will allow us and our partners to monetize apps more easily. As I visit with customers, I have seen the unique ways in which the ConnectKey software and apps are positively contributing to their business. 
For instance, one design and engineering company saved 25% by automating a document-laden process, accelerating the speed at which products get out the door. 
We also expanded our App Gallery. We populate it with apps such as those that can support the K-12 education sector by taking time-consuming tasks like grading tests and proofreading papers away from teachers, thereby allowing them to focus on students. 
In the high-end graphic communication area, we had a strong showing at the recent Print 18 trade show. We came away with 11 show awards, including a Vanguard award for the new Iridesse Production Press, and 5 awards relate 
[Audio Gap] 
a game-changer. It is the only digital press 
[Audio Gap] 
software. The new 
[Audio Gap] 
print in 1 pass with 6 colors, including gold, silver, white and clear dry ink. This allows our customers and partners to perform the same task at pennies of the cost of having to run multiple machine passes and offset processes. This opens up a huge opportunity for Xerox and our print-provider customers in the lucrative print embellishment market and supports the movement of more pages from offset into our digital space. 
It is also driving new business for us. In our international operations, over 50% of our installs are new placements, generating new print volume. And 90% of our Iridesse customers invested in the optional specialty dry ink print station to capture new applications with gold, silver, clear or white to grow their business. As one customer indicated, this press gives possibilities like no other digital printer on the market. 
As we previously communicated, we are revamping our innovation business model. This is central to returning Xerox to technology leadership, positioning us for the long-term success and ensuring proper monetization of our innovation. We have begun a thorough review of our software businesses to consider how we can better position them for growth, both as part of our core document business and on a stand-alone basis. We are examining our RD&E investments in xerography and inkjet to ensure that we maintain technology leadership and that we have the best approach to realize the high rates of return we require. 
Our leading expertise and technology in printing uniquely positions us to move into adjacencies that share similar core technology requirements. For instance, we are developing a road map to participate in 3D printing. We currently manufacture 3D printheads that we OEM, where we have differentiated capabilities around print technologies, materials, toner and software that will enable 3D printing to move to the next level of adoption for the production of end-use industrial parts. 
We are also accelerating market growth in emerging innovation areas to more quickly decide whether and how to incubate and scale opportunities for monetization. One example of this is the work we are doing around smart tags and printed electronics. This revolutionary technology has the potential to change how we store, sense, compute and communicate information. Real-world applications would include cold chain monitoring to ensure food traceability or to smart mouth guards that athletes could wear to monitor their health and fitness. This is just one of the ways we are looking to extend our existing IP to bring disruptive technologies into new industries. 
When appropriate, we will invest in our capabilities as well as in M&A through a revitalized process to enable commercialization of the technologies we create. A recent highlight where we have not only ramped up the visibility of an offering but also honed our market positioning is the latest version of DocuShare Flex 2.5. DocuShare historically has been an asset that was underappreciated within the corporate complex and thus, not optimally distributed. 
DocuShare Flex 2.5 helps companies solve their document-intensive workflow and file management challenges through a flexible cloud-based solution. Key upgrades include more seamless integration with the commonly used applications such as Salesforce and 
[Audio Gap] 
flow solutions to streamline accounts payable and receivable as well as enhance mobile capabilities. 
There is a lot of excitement amongst the Xerox team around our innovation opportunities. We look forward to better capitalizing our innovation capabilities and investments to capture the full value of this critical element of our business strategy. 
A top priority is making sure we have strong sustainable cash flow generation. In conjunction with our ""Own It"" initiatives, we are focused on improving our cash flow model through tighter management and improving the net working capital pillars. Cash flow was very positive in Q3. During the quarter, we implemented tighter controls around working capital. From this increased focus, we grew cash flow $157 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year, and as a result, we are increasing our full year free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion from our previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
We know it is very important to effectively deploy cash to provide good returns to our shareholders, both through improving our profit trajectory organically and inorganically as well as through direct returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we began to work to rebuild our M&A pipeline and to begin to frame out the investments that we'll be making in the future to drive improved profitable revenue growth. In terms of direct returns of capital, as I indicated earlier, we repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the third quarter, which translates to approximately 10.5 million shares or 4% of shares outstanding. And given the strength of our cash profile, we are increasing our full year repurchase expectations from $500 million to $700 million opportunistically. We will provide further updates on our priorities during Q4 earnings in January followed by a more in-depth review of the company's strategy and the ""Own It"" program during an Analyst Day in the first 2 weeks of February of 2019. 
I will now turn it over to Bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter."
103599,587236413,1574938,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2018",2018-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A, that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted",2198,"Thanks, John. Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A, that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. 
Revenue, as John highlighted, clearly remains a challenge. Overall, revenue declined 4.7% at constant currency while actual currency was down 5.8%. Currency went from being a benefit of about 2 points last quarter to now a headwind of approximately 1 point. Within revenue, we had growth in Workplace, A3 and A4 equipment, and overall, equipment revenue would have grown 1.7% at constant currency if it had not been for the impact of lower OEM sales. 
Post sale, however, continues to be pressured. Specifically, we saw weaker supply sales as well as a slowdown in Managed Print Services post sale. I'll spend more time on these dynamics when I cover the revenue slide. However, as noted last quarter, to stabilize revenue, we need our market share and placement growth to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and page volumes to help improve trends in post sale. 
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 13.1% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. The improvement came from a 40 basis point improvement in our SG&A ratio, driven by actions to reduce spans and layers and gain greater efficiency in our operations. Gross margin of 40.1% was flat year-over-year, a good result as the impact of higher revenue declines was offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including greater price discipline and controls. 
From a stream perspective, we saw positive mix within equipment from lower OEM sales where we lose money on the upfront sale while, within post sale, mix was a negative factor given the higher declines in supplies. Also contributing to the improvement in margin was higher equity income, which increased $14 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Drivers of the equity income improvement include benefits to Fuji Xerox from their recent cost actions as well as an easier compare given prior year higher bad debt provisions. 
Turning to below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $24 million were $7 million worse year-over-year, driven by lower gains on asset sales as the prior year included a $13 million gain associated with the sale of our Grenoble research center. Adjusted tax rate of 24.5% increased 5.2 points year over year, resulting in a negative $0.05 impact to EPS as the prior year rate was lower from a tax reserve reversal. 
Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.85 was down $0.04 from the third quarter of 2017, driven by the higher tax rate. On a GAAP basis, we had $0.34 of earnings per share, which was down $0.33 in the quarter, driven by a $0.37 or $95 million noncash charge associated with a change in the provisional estimated impact from the U.S. tax act, which was partially offset by $0.09 or $33 million in transaction and related cost reversals. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets as well as the aforementioned transaction cost reversal and U.S. tax act charge.
Moving on to revenue, where I'll break down our revenue decline of 4.7% at constant currency. Looking first at the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 4.2% at constant currency, with equipment revenue flat, driven by good growth in enterprise. Post sale in North America, however, was pressured with higher supplies and Managed Document Services declines year-over-year. 
International declined 2% at constant currency, an improvement over the 3.9% decline in Q2, driven by growth in equipment. Within international operations, we continued to see growth in developing markets while Europe's rate of decline improved sequentially. Our highest area of decline was in Other, driven by the OEM business, which had an overall negative 1 point impact to total revenue. 
Turning now to a closer look at equipment revenue. Equipment revenue declined 2.7% at constant currency. However, as highlighted earlier, it grew 1.7% excluding OEM. Entry equipment revenue made up 11% of equipment and was up 9.1% at constant currency, driven by growth in developing markets and U.S. channels. From a product perspective, black and white entry A4 products continue to show strong growth while color multifunction installs declined. 
Midrange equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 1% in constant currency. Areas of growth included U.S. enterprise, driven by large account sales, and continued growth across developing markets. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Europe, reflecting in part a more challenging compare, given higher channel purchases in the prior year associated with the building up  sufficient supply of newly launched products.  Install growth in midrange overall outpaced revenue, driven by a mix towards mono and lower-end color devices, in part from the better growth in developing markets where installs weight to the lower end. 
Midrange A3 is a key leadership segment for Xerox, and overall, it is midrange that has driven our equipment revenue share gains over the past 3 quarters. We have not yet gotten back the MIF lost prior to the ConnectKey launch, so growth needs to continue to get higher MIF and drive post sale improvement. 
Lastly, our results in the high end were very mixed. High-end equipment revenue made up 18% of total equipment revenue, and the decline improved sequentially, down 5.1% at constant currency versus down 9.9% in Q2. We saw strong demand for our new Iridesse press that exceeded our expectations. However, this growth was not enough to offset the impact of the lapping of the Versant product launch and declines in iGen. 
Turning to post sale. Post sale revenue comprised 78% of total revenue and declined 5.2% at constant currency. As discussed earlier, we have not seen the contracted post sale revenue trend improve, which is dependent on growing our machines in field and page volumes. And in the third quarter, we also experienced higher unbundled supplies revenue declines, which went from down 2.4% June year-to-date to down 7.7% in Q3. The supplies declines were driven by lower indirect channel sales, which were impacted by lower demand, including large customer order timing and economic uncertainty in certain developing market countries. 
To close on revenue, Managed Document Services comprised 36% of total revenue and continued to grow, up 0.9% at constant currency. This was a deceleration from the second quarter growth of 2.3%, driven by the impact of lower renewals in prior periods as well as timing of new business ramp. Positives within Managed Document Services include continued growth in partner print services to the SMB market as well as a second straight quarter of new business signings growth and a 4-point sequential improvement in the renewal rate to 79%. Renewal rate, however, was below our target of 85% to 90%, and overall renewal signings were lower than the prior year and drove a total signings decline of 2.8% at constant currency. As John indicated, we need to leverage our strong market position and new accreditations like FedRAMP to drive improving results in this segment of the market. 
Looking forward, we are not giving specific revenue guidance. However, I would like to highlight that, as indicated earlier, it will take time before we see revenue begin to improve. And secondly, although we expect to see improvement in some areas such as supplies, overall, the fourth quarter compare is the most difficult of the year, considering the timing of last year's ConnectKey product launch.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. Operating margin of 13.1% increased 100 basis points year-over-year while adjusted EPS of $0.85 declined $0.04 year-over-year. Overall, we viewed both operating margin and earnings per share as positives in the quarter. 
Looking at the profitability walk year-over-year. Within our operations, the impact of revenue declines were only partially offset by cost productivity benefits, resulting in a negative $0.02 year-over-year impact to EPS. However, our operations did drive a 40 basis point improvement in margin as we reduced costs at a higher rate than revenue decline. The remaining 60 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income that I highlighted earlier. This increase also was an approximate $0.05 benefit to EPS. 
In terms of unique items in the year-over-year quarter compare, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: a year-over-year negative impact of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per share associated with the gain we realized last year on the sale of our Grenoble research center; a $0.05 negative impact associated with a higher adjusted tax rate in Q3 2018 of 24.5% compared to a 19.3% tax rate in the prior year when we benefited from the conclusion of several audits. Partially offsetting these impacts was an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower shares, driven by the resumption of our share repurchases during the quarter. The benefit is not higher as we only realized a partial quarter of the lower shares. As well, shares had modestly grown since the prior year from compensation. So good results on profitability. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a source of $274 million in the quarter and we are at $725 million through 9 months while free cash flow was a source of $251 million in Q3 and $652 million year-to-date. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up $157 million year-over-year in the quarter on an adjusted basis, adjusting for the $500 million in incremental pension contributions and the GAAP change this year that required the reporting of deferred proceeds and beneficial interest from sales and receivables in investing cash flows instead of operating. September year-to-date operating cash flow is up $85 million and free cash flow is up $82 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. So overall, very positive results. 
I'll now take a few minutes to highlight some of the year-over-year drivers in the quarter. Working capital was a use of $47 million in the quarter, an improvement of $32 million over last year, driven by an improvement in inventories from improved supply demand process as compared to the prior year when we experienced inventory buildups associated with the ConnectKey product launch. 
Finance receivables were a source of $39 million in the quarter compared to a source of $75 million last year. So although it was not as big a help to cash flow, as indicated last quarter, this is an area where we would trade it being less of a source for higher equipment sales. 
Pension contributions were $36 million this quarter, which compare to $671 million in the prior year when we made the incremental $500 million in contributions. Adjusting for the $500 million, pension contributions were lower by $135 million, so a positive year-over-year contributor that more than offset the lower source from finance receivables. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $23 million and is $73 million year-to-date. This is an area, as highlighted last quarter, where we are placing greater scrutiny. And we now expect CapEx for the year to be approximately $100 million versus the previous guidance of $150 million. To conclude, this solid cash flow performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year cash flow guidance, narrowing our operating cash flow to the high end of the range, so now we expect $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion of operating cash flow; and narrowing and increasing our free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion, which also incorporates the lower CapEx expectations. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll speak to our capital structure. The third quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We break down the debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, finance receivables and equipment operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of the core business. In Q3, this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.4 billion and core debt of $1.8 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
To wrap up, we saw progress in the quarter across our profitability and cash flow measures and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Project ""Own It"" will drive long-term sustainable improvement across the business. And although revenue will be challenged in the near term, there are detailed actions underway to improve that trend over time. 
I'll now turn it back over to John for some concluding comments."

And then I'm just curious within your shrinking install. Like, in terms of the pressure in post sale, is that just a factor of your shrinking installed base?

But I would say that in recent months, there is clearly a lot more scrutiny. We're looking for strong margins throughout the life of longer-term, 4-, 5-year MDS arrangements and just making sure that from the get-go, that in the initial year and over the life of the contract, that there's an appropriate amount of margin in those contracts. To say -- have we lost any specific contracts because of that or not? That's really hard to tell. But there is clearly an emphasis on making sure that all the arrangements that we're entering into are profitable not only in the initial year but over the life of the arrangement. As far as the post sale and the shrinking installed base, I'd first like to say that the new product launch that we did last year is having an impact to offset, to get back the machines in field that we had lost in anticipation of that product launch. We're not fully back to where we were at, say the beginning, on machines in field in the beginning of 2017, but we certainly have made progress with our ESR in recent quarters. There is also an impact from page volume declines, a smaller impact. But the big thing for us is to get those machines in field to continue with the strong ESR we've seen in recent quarters."

And we saw improvements there when you compare the third quarter this year to the working capital impact in the third quarter of last year. And then lastly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a CapEx perspective, we're not a very CapEx-intensive company, but a lot of it would be in the IP spend area. And we had originally projected this year around $150 million. And we're just being more careful, in particular, making sure that we're spending those dollars in the right area where we'll get a payback on them, and right now, we're estimating that will be about $50 million less or about $100 million for the year in CapEx."

We are progressing on our priorities to optimize our operations for greater simplicity and reenergize our innovation engine while focusing on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns. In the quarter, we delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and a strong cash flow that is enabling us to raise our full year cash flow expectations for 2018. 
Work remains on all fronts. However, clearly, our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort. We were disappointed in the revenue in Q3. We have an action plan to improve revenue that includes, among other things, simplifying the organizational structure, improving alignment of compensation and evaluating contracts that are not profitable. We will go through each of the priorities in more detail, but I will start with a closer look at our results. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 4.7% at constant currency, with equipment revenue performing better, down 2.7%, while post sales declined 5.2%. Both A4 and A3 equipment revenue grew at a constant currency, up 9% and 1%, respectively, showing the continued momentum from our ConnectKey products. 
While high end declined 5%, we did improve from Q2, and we saw good market demand for our new Iridesse printing press. Iridesse hits a sweet spot within the high-end market, enabling both better productivity with a single pass technology and differentiation with its gold, silver, white and clear dry ink capabilities. Post sales will take time to improve. We need to build back our machines in field after ceding share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch and penetrate further our offerings into our customer base. 
Operating margin of 13.1% in the quarter increased sequentially 120 basis points and 100 basis points year-over-year, driven in part by our work to simplify our business, reduce management layers and eliminate resources in areas where capacity or skills were suboptimal. 
Overall adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 reflected the work of the team. Operating profit increased as margin expansion, including the impact of higher equity income, more than offset the revenue declines. A higher tax rate and lower gains on asset sales, however, resulted in a year-over-year EPS decline. On a GAAP basis, earnings declines were greater, driven by a onetime noncash tax act-related true-up. 
On cash, we delivered $274 million in operating cash flow and $251 million in free cash flow, an increase of $157 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis for both measures. This strength, as highlighted, gives us confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion versus the previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, we are delivering on our commitment to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the end of September, we repurchased $284 million in shares and distributed $204 million in dividends, which, in the aggregate, represents approximately 75% of September year-to-date free cash flow. 
With the strength of our cash flow and our significant cash balance of over $1 billion, along with our continued view that repurchasing our stock provides an attractive ROI, we are increasing our 2018 share repurchase expectations. We now expect to opportunistically repurchase up to $700 million from up to $500 million. This will put us well above the commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we launched project ""Own It,"" which is focused on simplifying the business to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed accountability and effectiveness. This will deliver a superior customer experience while setting the company up for growth. In Q3, we identified the actions and work streams while also capturing some early wins. 
Optimization actions will expand in Q4 as we complete the ""Own It"" design phase for initiatives such as establishing more effective shared services centers, rationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base. And this is where the experience of key hires with expertise in these areas will be instrumental in driving change, leveraging strategies proven out in other enterprises. 
Establishing effective shared services centers is one example of an opportunity to improve the way we work to create an agile, frictionless business that delivers enhanced performance for our customers. 
Xerox has moved some functions to lower-cost locations in the past. However, we see significant potential in creating world-class centers of excellence, which will result in greater quality, speed and productivity. We will do this by measuring and improving year-over-year performance through the introduction of standardized processes and metrics. 
Automation, real-time analytics and robotics process automation will be another key strategy to drive efficiency and quality. RPA will be embedded in our new design as we simplify and build new end-to-end processes. For instance, RPA can be used in our order-to-cash process to validate data quality as well as scan, post and match purchase orders and invoice processing. 
Through all of this, we are also looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our business through simplification. An example of this is our initiative to rationalize our number of SKUs and product offerings with a goal of eliminating numerous configurations of essentially the same product and by employing a better design for efficiency through an increased number of common parts. The focus of our optimization efforts is on delivering greater customer value and translating actions into profitable revenue growth. 
We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structure and include further expanding our channel presence, including independent dealer coverage to go after the SMB market. Enhancing our e-commerce capabilities, this is an area where we will be making investments and changes, including investment in our partner e-commerce portals for order management, inventory availability, shipping status and much more functionality that makes it easier for partners and our end customers. We will also invest and grow our direct e-commerce portal for product information, order placement and shipping status. Leveraging more digital demand generation inside sales lead generation to help capture new customers will be key as well as improving deal pricing and contracting while turning around unprofitable contracts. 
In addition, to drive long-term growth, we need to increase our focus on software innovation to deliver differentiated value to our customers and expand into adjacent markets. Changing the top line trends won't happen overnight, but we have the products, the innovation, the talent and the customer relationships to do it. We are early in our ""Own It"" initiative, and we expect momentum to build over time.
We have some notable recent achievements that will help build the foundation for better future revenue performance, including becoming the first and only MPS vendor to receive security authorization for cloud-based Managed Print Services from the U.S. government. This is a significant accomplishment that sets Xerox apart from our peers and allows federal agencies to utilize Xerox for services without going through a lengthy security vetting process. Security is one of the biggest concerns for corporate America, and receiving FedRAMP helps not only penetrate the nearly $100 billion annual federal IT market but it is also a validation of our leading-edge security capabilities that companies of all size are looking for. 
Additionally, we further solidified our leadership in MPS, achieving for the ninth straight year the #1 position in Quocirca's worldwide MPS market landscape report. This will continue to provide us the runway to gain wallet share, enabling expansion into digital workflow services, which can help business drive further efficiency and productivity improvement. 
At the beginning of October, we announced further enhancements to our ConnectKey software, and we launched an embedded e-commerce platform that will allow us and our partners to monetize apps more easily. As I visit with customers, I have seen the unique ways in which the ConnectKey software and apps are positively contributing to their business. 
For instance, one design and engineering company saved 25% by automating a document-laden process, accelerating the speed at which products get out the door. 
We also expanded our App Gallery. We populate it with apps such as those that can support the K-12 education sector by taking time-consuming tasks like grading tests and proofreading papers away from teachers, thereby allowing them to focus on students. 
In the high-end graphic communication area, we had a strong showing at the recent Print 18 trade show. We came away with 11 show awards, including a Vanguard award for the new Iridesse Production Press, and 5 awards relate 
[Audio Gap] 
a game-changer. It is the only digital press 
[Audio Gap] 
software. The new 
[Audio Gap] 
print in one pass with 6 colors, including gold, silver, white and clear dry ink. This allows our customers and partners to perform the same task at pennies of the cost of having to run multiple machine passes and offset processes. This opens up a huge opportunity for Xerox and our print-provider customers in the lucrative print embellishment market and supports the movement of more pages from offset into our digital space. 
It is also driving new business for us. In our international operations, over 50% of our installs are new placements, generating new print volume. And 90% of our Iridesse customers invested in the optional specialty dry ink print station to capture new applications with gold, silver, clear or white to grow their business. As one customer indicated, this press gives possibilities like no other digital printer on the market. 
As we previously communicated, we are revamping our innovation business model. This is central to returning Xerox to technology leadership, positioning us for the long-term success and ensuring proper monetization of our innovation. We have begun a thorough review of our software businesses to consider how we can better position them for growth, both as part of our core document business and on a stand-alone basis. We are examining our RD&E investments in xerography and inkjet to ensure that we maintain technology leadership and that we have the best approach to realize the high rates of return we require. 
Our leading expertise and technology in printing uniquely positions us to move into adjacencies that share similar core technology requirements. For instance, we are developing a road map to participate in 3D printing. We currently manufacture 3D printheads that we OEM, where we have differentiated capabilities around print technologies, materials, toner and software that will enable 3D printing to move to the next level of adoption for the production of end-use industrial parts. 
We are also accelerating market growth in emerging innovation areas to more quickly decide whether and how to incubate and scale opportunities for monetization. One example of this is the work we are doing around smart tags and printed electronics. This revolutionary technology has the potential to change how we store, sense, compute and communicate information. Real-world applications would include cold chain monitoring to ensure food traceability or to smart mouth guards that athletes could wear to monitor their health and fitness. This is just one of the ways we are looking to extend our existing IP to bring disruptive technologies into new industries. 
When appropriate, we will invest in our capabilities as well as in M&A through a revitalized process to enable commercialization of the technologies we create. A recent highlight where we have not only ramped up the visibility of an offering but also honed our market positioning is the latest version of DocuShare Flex 2.5. DocuShare historically has been an asset that was underappreciated within the corporate complex and thus, not optimally distributed. 
DocuShare Flex 2.5 helps companies solve their document-intensive workflow and file management challenges through a flexible cloud-based solution. Key upgrades include more seamless integration with the commonly used applications such as Salesforce and 
[Audio Gap] 
flow solutions to streamline accounts payable and receivable as well as enhance mobile capabilities. 
There is a lot of excitement amongst the Xerox team around our innovation opportunities. We look forward to better capitalizing our innovation capabilities and investments to capture the full value of this critical element of our business strategy. 
A top priority is making sure we have strong sustainable cash flow generation. In conjunction with our ""Own It"" initiatives, we are focused on improving our cash flow model through tighter management and improving the net working capital pillars. Cash flow was very positive in Q3. During the quarter, we implemented tighter controls around working capital. From this increased focus, we grew cash flow $157 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year, and as a result, we are increasing our full year free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion from our previous range of $750 million to $950 million. 
We know it is very important to effectively deploy cash to provide good returns to our shareholders, both through improving our profit trajectory organically and inorganically as well as through direct returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we began to work to rebuild our M&A pipeline and to begin to frame out the investments that we'll be making in the future to drive improved profitable revenue growth. In terms of direct returns of capital, as I indicated earlier, we repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the third quarter, which translates to approximately 10.5 million shares or 4% of shares outstanding. And given the strength of our cash profile, we are increasing our full year repurchase expectations from $500 million to $700 million opportunistically. We will provide further updates on our priorities during Q4 earnings in January followed by a more in-depth review of the company's strategy and the ""Own It"" program during an Analyst Day in the first 2 weeks of February of 2019. 
I will now turn it over to Bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter."
103599,587236413,1575309,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2018",2018-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted",2198,"Thanks, John. Let me start with a review of the income statement. Overall, we were pleased with the performance within the cost and expense lines, especially G&A that resulted in operating margin expansion despite revenue headwinds and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. 
Revenue, as John highlighted, clearly remains a challenge. Overall, revenue declined 4.7% at constant currency while actual currency was down 5.8%. Currency went from being a benefit of about 2 points last quarter to now a headwind of approximately 1 point. Within revenue, we had growth in Workplace, A3 and A4 equipment, and overall, equipment revenue would have grown 1.7% at constant currency if it had not been for the impact of lower OEM sales. 
Post sale, however, continues to be pressured. Specifically, we saw weaker supply sales as well as a slowdown in Managed Print Services post sale. I'll spend more time on these dynamics when I cover the revenue slide. However, as noted last quarter, to stabilize revenue, we need our market share and placement growth to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in field and page volumes to help improve trends in post sale. 
Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 13.1% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. The improvement came from a 40 basis point improvement in our SG&A ratio, driven by actions to reduce spans and layers and gain greater efficiency in our operations. Gross margin of 40.1% was flat year-over-year, a good result as the impact of higher revenue declines was offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including greater price discipline and controls. 
From a stream perspective, we saw positive mix within equipment from lower OEM sales where we lose money on the upfront sale while, within post sale, mix was a negative factor given the higher declines in supplies. Also contributing to the improvement in margin was higher equity income, which increased $14 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Drivers of the equity income improvement include benefits to Fuji Xerox from their recent cost actions as well as an easier compare given prior year higher bad debt provisions. 
Turning to below-the-line items. Adjusted other expenses net of $24 million were $7 million worse year-over-year, driven by lower gains on asset sales as the prior year included a $13 million gain associated with the sale of our Grenoble research center. Adjusted tax rate of 24.5% increased 5.2 points year over year, resulting in a negative $0.05 impact to EPS as the prior year rate was lower from a tax reserve reversal. 
Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.85 was down $0.04 from the third quarter of 2017, driven by the higher tax rate. On a GAAP basis, we had $0.34 of earnings per share, which was down $0.33 in the quarter, driven by a $0.37 or $95 million noncash charge associated with a change in the provisional estimated impact from the U.S. tax act, which was partially offset by $0.09 or $33 million in transaction and related cost reversals. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets as well as the aforementioned transaction cost reversal and U.S. tax act charge.
Moving on to revenue, where I'll break down our revenue decline of 4.7% at constant currency. Looking first at the geographic sales channels. North America revenues were down 4.2% at constant currency, with equipment revenue flat, driven by good growth in enterprise. Post sale in North America, however, was pressured with higher supplies and Managed Document Services declines year-over-year. 
International declined 2% at constant currency, an improvement over the 3.9% decline in Q2, driven by growth in equipment. Within international operations, we continued to see growth in developing markets while Europe's rate of decline improved sequentially. Our highest area of decline was in Other, driven by the OEM business, which had an overall negative 1 point impact to total revenue. 
Turning now to a closer look at equipment revenue. Equipment revenue declined 2.7% at constant currency. However, as highlighted earlier, it grew 1.7% excluding OEM. Entry equipment revenue made up 11% of equipment and was up 9.1% at constant currency, driven by growth in developing markets and U.S. channels. From a product perspective, black and white entry A4 products continue to show strong growth while color multifunction installs declined. 
Midrange equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 1% in constant currency. Areas of growth included U.S. enterprise, driven by large account sales, and continued growth across developing markets. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Europe, reflecting in part a more challenging compare, given higher channel purchases in the prior year associated with the building up sufficient supply of newly launched products. Install growth in midrange overall outpaced revenue, driven by a mix towards mono and lower-end color devices, in part from the better growth in developing markets where installs weight to the lower end. 
Midrange A3 is a key leadership segment for Xerox, and overall, it is midrange that has driven our equipment revenue share gains over the past 3 quarters. We have not yet gotten back the MIF lost prior to the ConnectKey launch, so growth needs to continue to get higher MIF and drive post sale improvement. 
Lastly, our results in the high end were very mixed. High-end equipment revenue made up 18% of total equipment revenue, and the decline improved sequentially, down 5.1% at constant currency versus down 9.9% in Q2. We saw strong demand for our new Iridesse press that exceeded our expectations. However, this growth was not enough to offset the impact of the lapping of the Versant product launch and declines in iGen. 
Turning to post sale. Post sale revenue comprised 78% of total revenue and declined 5.2% at constant currency. As discussed earlier, we have not seen the contracted post sale revenue trend improve, which is dependent on growing our machines in field and page volumes. And in the third quarter, we also experienced higher unbundled supplies revenue declines, which went from down 2.4% June year-to-date to down 7.7% in Q3. The supplies declines were driven by lower indirect channel sales, which were impacted by lower demand, including large customer order timing and economic uncertainty in certain developing market countries. 
To close on revenue, Managed Document Services comprised 36% of total revenue and continued to grow, up 0.9% at constant currency. This was a deceleration from the second quarter growth of 2.3%, driven by the impact of lower renewals in prior periods as well as timing of new business ramp. Positives within Managed Document Services include continued growth in partner print services to the SMB market as well as a second straight quarter of new business signings growth and a 4-point sequential improvement in the renewal rate to 79%. Renewal rate, however, was below our target of 85% to 90%, and overall renewal signings were lower than the prior year and drove a total signings decline of 2.8% at constant currency. As John indicated, we need to leverage our strong market position and new accreditations like FedRAMP to drive improving results in this segment of the market. 
Looking forward, we are not giving specific revenue guidance. However, I would like to highlight that, as indicated earlier, it will take time before we see revenue begin to improve. And secondly, although we expect to see improvement in some areas such as supplies, overall, the fourth quarter compare is the most difficult of the year, considering the timing of last year's ConnectKey product launch.
Turning now for a closer look at Xerox' profitability performance. Operating margin of 13.1% increased 100 basis points year-over-year while adjusted EPS of $0.85 declined $0.04 year-over-year. Overall, we viewed both operating margin and earnings per share as positives in the quarter. 
Looking at the profitability walk year-over-year. Within our operations, the impact of revenue declines were only partially offset by cost productivity benefits, resulting in a negative $0.02 year-over-year impact to EPS. However, our operations did drive a 40 basis point improvement in margin as we reduced costs at a higher rate than revenue decline. The remaining 60 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income that I highlighted earlier. This increase also was an approximate $0.05 benefit to EPS. 
In terms of unique items in the year-over-year quarter compare, there were 3 that we believe should be highlighted, 2 negative and 1 positive. They include: a year-over-year negative impact of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per share associated with the gain we realized last year on the sale of our Grenoble research center; a $0.05 negative impact associated with a higher adjusted tax rate in Q3 2018 of 24.5% compared to a 19.3% tax rate in the prior year when we benefited from the conclusion of several audits. Partially offsetting these impacts was an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower shares, driven by the resumption of our share repurchases during the quarter. The benefit is not higher as we only realized a partial quarter of the lower shares. As well, shares had modestly grown since the prior year from compensation. So good results on profitability. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a source of $274 million in the quarter and we are at $725 million through 9 months while free cash flow was a source of $251 million in Q3 and $652 million year-to-date. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up $157 million year-over-year in the quarter on an adjusted basis, adjusting for the $500 million in incremental pension contributions and the GAAP change this year that required the reporting of deferred proceeds and beneficial interest from sales and receivables in investing cash flows instead of operating. September year-to-date operating cash flow is up $85 million and free cash flow is up $82 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. So overall, very positive results. 
I'll now take a few minutes to highlight some of the year-over-year drivers in the quarter. Working capital was a use of $47 million in the quarter, an improvement of $32 million over last year, driven by an improvement in inventories from improved supply demand process as compared to the prior year when we experienced inventory buildups associated with the ConnectKey product launch. 
Finance receivables were a source of $39 million in the quarter compared to a source of $75 million last year. So although it was not as big a help to cash flow, as indicated last quarter, this is an area where we would trade it being less of a source for higher equipment sales. 
Pension contributions were $36 million this quarter, which compare to $671 million in the prior year when we made the incremental $500 million in contributions. Adjusting for the $500 million, pension contributions were lower by $135 million, so a positive year-over-year contributor that more than offset the lower source from finance receivables. 
Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $23 million and is $73 million year-to-date. This is an area, as highlighted last quarter, where we are placing greater scrutiny. And we now expect CapEx for the year to be approximately $100 million versus the previous guidance of $150 million. To conclude, this solid cash flow performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year cash flow guidance, narrowing our operating cash flow to the high end of the range, so now we expect $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion of operating cash flow; and narrowing and increasing our free cash flow range to $900 million to $1 billion, which also incorporates the lower CapEx expectations. 
If we turn to the next slide, I'll speak to our capital structure. The third quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We break down the debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, finance receivables and equipment operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of the core business. In Q3, this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.4 billion and core debt of $1.8 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018, with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019. 
Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year. 
To wrap up, we saw progress in the quarter across our profitability and cash flow measures and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Project ""Own It"" will drive long-term sustainable improvement across the business. And although revenue will be challenged in the near term, there are detailed actions underway to improve that trend over time. 
I'll now turn it back over to John for some concluding comments."

But I would say that in recent months, there is clearly a lot more scrutiny.

To say -- have we lost any specific contracts because of that or not? That's really hard to tell. But there is clearly an emphasis on making sure that all the arrangements that we're entering into are profitable not only in the initial year but over the life of the arrangement. As far as the post sale and the shrinking installed base, I'd first like to say that the new product launch that we did last year is having an impact to offset, to get back the machines in field that we had lost in anticipation of that product launch. We're not fully back to where we were at, say the beginning, on machines in field in the beginning of 2017, but we certainly have made progress with our ESR in recent quarters. There is also an impact from page volume declines, a smaller impact. But the big thing for us is to get those machines in field to continue with the strong ESR we've seen in recent quarters."

From a new business signings perspective, we were actually up 15% during the quarter. So overall signings were down about 2.8%. But new business signings were a good story, and it's clearly an area of focus for us."

It's more of us just making sure that we're putting in the right effort and making sure that we're getting the right profitability on the contract."

Xerox historically has been a strong cash flow producer, and we continue to expect that to be the case. From a -- specifically, rationale and reasons for why we are upping to the higher part of our range from an OCF perspective and free cash flow perspective, first of all, as you saw during the quarter, better cost controls, better margins we have in place. And more increased focus -- not that we weren't before, but there's really a really increased focus on working capital. And we saw improvements there when you compare the third quarter this year to the working capital impact in the third quarter of last year. And then lastly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a CapEx perspective, we're not a very CapEx-intensive company, but a lot of it would be in the IP spend area. And we had originally projected this year around $150 million. And we're just being more careful, in particular, making sure that we're spending those dollars in the right area where we'll get a payback on them, and right now, we're estimating that will be about $50 million less or about $100 million for the year in CapEx."
