First of all, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. 
We continue to improve and invest in safety solutions and that is evident by extremely lower loss time and [ injury ] frequency rate and total of report injury during the period. 
Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continuous cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and non-fuel retail expansion. 
We are on track to meet our announced targets for 2018, and we remain focused on delivering growth beyond that. I will now let John give you an update on our strategy. John?"

And good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also non-fuel transactions, we're down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were implemented in Q4 of last year. 
So we're just starting to grand for that right now. 
That said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC flax, the ongoing expansion and preparation of expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. As you won't expect partnerships have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
Performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA, excluding gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was all driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we broke down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1 as at the end of the [ 30th of September. ] 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you to and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth and expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in Quarter 4 and actually would expect that may actually be true. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in North area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transaction, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes during the higher oil flex. 
Our ADNOC flex initiative had been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service station. We set this target at [indiscernible] that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final sites having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our premium of self-service. This initiative has been part of the wider commitment. To move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers a real choice, convenience and better quality of fuel products and services. 
The premium service that we launched [indiscernible] at a price of [ 10 DM ] per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end of our IPO and announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration level of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium fueling customers awards that can be deemed, and we're linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll out ADNOC flex across all new stations that will be open in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience store since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3 as part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of a partnership with [indiscernible], we have converted 5 stores in Tucson express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 [indiscernible]  expressed stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current [indiscernible] stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average [ factory ] size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transaction that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including [ allied ] services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
After the quarter-over-quarter comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, fuel revitalization and promotion, including the flex award that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress on our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures, adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include civil aviation [indiscernible] bonus that we paid in in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash on [indiscernible] basis, actually decreased by 9.8%, year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018, and has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third party contracting negotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we are proud that we're ahead of the [ $50 million ] of ADNOC savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved [ to date of ] 10% reduction in CapEx requirement for the construction of new stock. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new style, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of flight station in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
We are on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance of the IPO of [ $215 million to $250 million ], I should say. This is higher though then we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by a strategic accelerations in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrade, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, and particularly, quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during the course of third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to first -- the pricing of fuel [indiscernible], the renewal of refined products, play agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains, driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry leading margins has continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along whit the significant reduction in CapEx has led to 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual gas movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, [ gas ] from Axel operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In a recent, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year end, we expect this amount was still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finest cost of $200 million dividend paid in April, total cash generates and amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our first gas [indiscernible] has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net-debt-to EBITDA ratio of only [ 0.1x compared to 1.7x ] as of the [ 31st ] of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1st, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million, they made it to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42% and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient. There's quite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% a decrease during the first quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview [ for ] our segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments. This quarter with double-digit and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with same gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and segments despite, lower volumes. 
On the Fuel -- Nonfuel Retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year, for 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also nonfuel retail gross profit allied services has increased by 8.1 -- 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our Corporate segment gross profit has increasers by 9.1% in the third quarter, year-on-year, and this is on the back of more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
Finally, the Aviation segment has benefited from the chance of contractual profile, got to cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The Fuel and Nonfuel Retail segments witnessed the significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by a 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7 decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of unrecoverable costs in civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting on the revenue across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to 48, there [indiscernible] in terms of gross margin versus around 0.4 to 8 -- sorry, versus 0.33. 
I just wanted to look at given where the oil price backdrop, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin that we can look at if we take out the gain, you're running at around [ $0.43 per liter]. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the non-fuel retail. You mentioned the gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've establish some part as in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John you were on [ Bloomberg ], [indiscernible] talking about Saudi expansions. I'm just wondering, the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like [indiscernible], are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why start at this time, unless its a fansize mode, and you're going to get a management fee. 
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your [ point 4 3], I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And you question therefore on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop. we have -- and I know backstop is bad word, but the backed up we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, it turns [indiscernible]. the oil prices were to go down significantly next year. We still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see as risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that. But we feel pretty resilient to round that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period.

What penetration rates are you expecting for service refueling in 2019 and beyond? I see that we were 20% in the first quarter in Q3, I just would like to know what we see them at going forward? 
The second question is on the number of patient additions, do you think we could revisit the number of patient additions and the UAE, given the demand dynamics in the UAE this year? Or are we still looking for a [indiscernible] stations per annum 2019 onwards? 
And then the next question is on CapEx? I believe, we said that from around $210 million of CapEx this year on around 13 stations, we were looking for up to 40% reduction and some construction cost per station next year so that would bring CapEx down to around $100 million to $120 million. Do you think that's achievable?"

And what we're seeing, I can say is that the ADNOC flex penetration has improved the uptick on robotic sector is growing, but we haven't got -- given a guidance for 2019 as yet. 
What we did do though, I mean, we were very clear that wanted to go in ADNOC flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to [indiscernible ] that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just to [indiscernible] the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model [indiscernible] significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of [indiscernible] station addition. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit a number of stations we put on. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count as I reduce CapEx [indiscernible] a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline and [indiscernible] mindful of any congestin, [ et cetera ], across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment, that we feel with -- especially with our [indiscernible] and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE, and of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx for $210 million in a guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations for sure. We see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those, and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is, its maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx, and therefore it is not old, new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our net worth. But that as part of our CapEx budget, so our total CapEx budget is not [indiscernible] at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the [ total ] $200 million."

In terms of the Corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we used to do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our [ gas], in particular. And that's why therefore really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
And what we found as a result of that is competitively -- we were disadvantaged as oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and their oil prices went up. People as kind of came to buy some of it, because we [indiscernible] monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice a week, a pricing structure, which is much more in line with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we reposition our pricing prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margin so it's what we do our work is what we and why with customers as well. And therefore that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from the diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore there is a level of seasonality around it in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is and I think that is why there is some fluctuation at month-to-month within that."

I might look for my legal colleague, as I answer the first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around flex, [ AED 10 ] and Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you if I look at [indiscernible], some of the Emirates is significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are low, and [ indiscernible] the feedback we get. 
And I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing premium or self-service over just because a [ AED 10 ] charge. There is we've done the feedback when we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefits of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID in our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the station. 
So I think we are pleased and uncertainty we don't see Northern Emirates and the [ AED 10 ] charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose [ AED 10]. We choose [ AED 10 ] at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our [ AED 10 ] is what has allowed us to do, not just to invest but actually link it to the awards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing in driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming to it in numbers of time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade up and opportunities to our customers around flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of awards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is what, I believe, in the region of [ AED 12.50 ]. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time as [indiscernible] is driving traffic to the [indiscernible] store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our supplies. 
So from our perspective, it makes sense a bit more important from a customer perspective and a reward and a premium choice. It makes sense like a lot of the feedback we've had, around a rewards program as we've changed them is to understand point people just everybody didn't go to the flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and some up effective, its a win win. 
So that's why we chose it as [ AED 10]. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wise -- wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And the desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is a great optionality around this this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."

First of all, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. 
We continue to improve and invest in safety solutions and that is evident by extremely low lost time injury frequency rate and total report of the injury during the period. 
Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continued cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and nonfuel retail expansion. 
We are on track to meet our announced targets for 2018, and we remain focused on delivering growth beyond that. I will now let John give you an update on our strategy. John?"

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also our non-fuel transactions were down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were -- was implemented in Q4 of last year, so we're just starting the ground floor that now. 
However, that said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC Flex, the ongoing expansion and preparation of expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Our G√©ant Express partnership have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
The strength of that performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA excluding inventory gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was also driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we brought down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1 as at the end of the 30th of September. 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in quarter 4 and actually will expect that may actually be 2. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in that area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transaction, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes due to the higher oil prices. 
Our ADNOC Flex initiative has been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service stations. We've set this target at our IPO and we're proud that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final site having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our Premium or Self-service. This initiative has been part of a wider commitment to move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers real choice, convenience and better quality fuel products and services. 
The Premium service that we launched on the office at a price of AED 10 per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end, in fact, of our IPO announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our Premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration levels of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC Flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium refueling customers rewards that can be deemed and were linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll out ADNOC Flex across all new stations that will be opened in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned, we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience stores since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3. As part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of our partnership with G√©ant. We have converted 5 stores into G√©ant  Express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 G√©ant Express stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current G√©ant stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average factory basket size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transaction that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including allied services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
On a quarter-over-quarter's comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, store revitalization and promotions, including the Flex award that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress upon our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures. Adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include Civil Aviation Supply Carve-Out, the one-off fuel site bonus that we paid in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash OpEx has actually decreased by 9.8% year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018. And has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group. Multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third-party contract renegotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we're proud that we're ahead of the $50 million of OpEx savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved to date a 10% reduction in CapEx requirement for the construction of new sites. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new sites, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of 5 stations in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
And we're on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect total CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance at the IPO of $215 million -- $250 million, I should say. This is higher though than we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by strategic acceleration in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrades, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, in particular, in quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our financial results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to, first, the pricing of fuel following the renewal of our refined products supply agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry leading margins had continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along with the significant reduction in CapEx has led to a 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual cash movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, cash flow generated from actual operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In addition, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year-end, we expect this amount whilst still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finance cost and $200 million dividend paid in April, total cash generation amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our gross cash position has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net debt-to EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x compared to 1.7x as of the 31st of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million related to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42%, and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient despite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% decrease during the third quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview by segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments this quarter with double-digit retail and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with the improved gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and aviation segments despite lower volumes. 
On the fuel and nonfuel retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year to 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also, nonfuel retail gross profit including allied services has increased by 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our corporate segment gross profit has increased by 9.1% in the third quarter year-on-year, and this is on the back of a more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
And finally, the aviation segment has benefited from the change of contractual profile with a cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The fuel and nonfuel retail segments witnessed a significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7% decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of recoverable costs related to civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

So in summary, we approach the end of the year with momentum after another set of resilient results in the third quarter.

We would also continue our expansion in both fuel and nonfuel retails with entrance to the Dubai and international market, while pursuing our efforts on cost efficiencies and working capital management. 
We are confident for the recovery and the medium to term -- medium term in light of the significant government investments that have been announced and we have been also -- are confident on the market expected to support the UAE economy. Finally, we remain grateful for our shareholders continued belief in ADNOC Distribution's future growth and positive development.

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting you on the revenues across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to AED 48 per liter in terms of gross margin versus around AED 0.48, sorry, versus AED 0.33. 
I just want to look at, I mean, given where the oil price backdropped, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin per liter that we can look at? I mean, if we take out the gains, you are running at around AED 0.43 per liter. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the nonfuel retail. You mentioned gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, it's only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've established some targets in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John, you were on Bloomberg busy talking about Saudi expansion. I'm just wondering the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like ALDREES are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why Saudi at this time, unless it's a franchised model, and you're going to get a management fee?
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

Thank you very much. Wow. All right, let me try and start with your fuel margin. I think we have been trying to be much more transparent this side -- this time in terms of the impact of oil price gains. And we said, in the quarter it was about $20 million and year-to-date $80 million. So those are the best figures we can come up with and I think they're pretty accurate. 
In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your AED 0.43, I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And your question, therefore, on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop we have, and I know backstop is a bad word at the moment across the world, but the backstop we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, it terms of absolute terms. And if oil prices were to go down significantly next year, we still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see a risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that, but we feel pretty resilient around that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period. 
In our nonfuel retail -- sorry, please go ahead."

And what we saw after that was a significant uplift in Q3 last year, people buying upfront of that and a significant drop into Q4. 
And therefore, what I expect to see going forward as we now come out of the period and we have a much more like-for-like basis is better, pretty good in comparison year-on-year. 
That said, our conversion rate is still lower than we would like it to be. We have given guidance that our nonfuel growth profit as a percentage of our oil profit was below 10%. We're creeping up, but we -- our target is a 25% target and that remains 25% to 50% in the long run, remains our target there.

In terms of our Saudi Arabia expansion, it is a franchise model that we're going with, you're absolutely right in your observation. And what we have said is the opening of our sites to Saudi Arabia is that we wanted to actually position ourselves in Saudi Arabia with an operating license, which we have got, and we wanted to actually start to operate and to learn how to operate in Saudi Arabia. That is what the sites that we're opening will do. But it's through a franchised model and therefore it has a minimum of CapEx for us. It has, obviously, strong IRRs, but low absolute profitability when you have so fewer sites, there is no downside risk to us there."

So I believe, we said that from around $210 million of CapEx this year on around 13 stations, we were looking for up to 40% reduction in construction cost per station next year, so that will bring CapEx down to around $100 million to $120 million. Do you think that's achievable?"

Thank you. In terms of the penetration rate, we haven't given guidance on 2019. We're giving results on 2018. And what we're seeing, I can say is that the -- our ADNOC Flex penetration as improve the uptake on rewards, et cetera, is growing, but we",417,"Okay. Thank you. In terms of the penetration rate, we haven't given guidance on 2019. We're giving results on 2018. And what we're seeing, I can say is that the -- our ADNOC Flex penetration as improve the uptake on rewards, et cetera, is growing, but we haven't got -- given a guidance for 2019 as yet. 
What we did do, though, and we were really clear is that we wanted to go in ADNOC Flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to AED 10, that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just around the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model and [indiscernible] to see significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of station additions. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit the number of stations we put. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and our nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count at a reduced CapEx, a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline, but we're also mindful of any congestion, et cetera, across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment. So we feel with -- especially with ADNOC Flex and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE. And of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx, the $210 million. Our guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations, for sure, we see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say that somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is -- it's maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx. And therefore, it is not all new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, as I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our network, but that is part of our CapEx budget. So our total CapEx budget is not all in at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the total $200 million."

In terms of the corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our gas oil business and our diesel business, in particular. And that's why, therefore, really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
What we found as a result of that is competitively  we were disadvantaged. As oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and then oil prices went up, people kind of tend to buy from us, because we had set a monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice-a-week pricing structure, which is much more in line in fairness with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we can -- we reposition our pricing, as prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margins. So it's much more dynamic and it's actually more in tune in fairness, I think, with the customers as well. And therefore, that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore, the level of seasonality around this in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is, and I think that is why there is some fluctuation month-to-month within that."

We see as well and we've recognized that the price at the pump has been an all-time record price, and therefore, we've seen some level of discretionary spend, and when I look at that, I'd given an example of maybe the traffic between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is reduced where people potentially stay over a little bit more and travel less.

I might look for my legal colleague, as I answer. The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10  in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not goi",612,"Okay. I might look for my legal colleague, as I answer. The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10  in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you as I look at the different Emirates, some of the Emirates are significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are lower and with the feedback we get, and I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing Premium or Self-service all with just because of a AED 10 charge. There is -- we've done the feedback and we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefit of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID and our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the stations. 
So I think we are pleased, and certainly we don't see Northern Emirates and the AED 10 charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose AED 10. We chose AED 10 at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our AED 10 is what it has allowed us to do, not just as invest but actually link it to rewards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing and driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming true in numbers all the time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade-open opportunities to our customers around Flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of rewards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is worth, I believe, in the region of AED 12.50. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time, it's also driving traffic into a convenience store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our suppliers.
So from our perspective, it makes sense. But more importantly, from a customer perspective and the rewards and a premium choice, it makes sense. A lot of the feedback we've had around the rewards program as we've changed them is -- don't understand why people just everybody doesn't go to the Flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and from our perspective, it's a win-win. 
So that's why we chose AED 10. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And our desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is the great optionality around this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."

First of all, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. 
We continue to improve and invest in safety solutions and that is evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency rate and total report of the injury during the period. 
Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continued cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and nonfuel retail expansion. 
We are on track to meet our announced targets for 2018, and we remain focused on delivering growth beyond that. I will now let John give you an update on our strategy. John?"

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also our non-fuel transactions were down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were -- was implemented in Q4 of last year, so we're just starting to grandfather that now. 
However, that said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC Flex, the ongoing expansion and preparation to expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Our G√©ant Express partnership have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
The strength of that performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA excluding inventory gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was also driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we brought down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1x as at the end of the 30th of September. 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in quarter 4 and actually will expect that may actually be 2. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in that area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transactions, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes due to the higher oil prices. 
Our ADNOC Flex initiative has been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service stations. We've set this target at our IPO and we're proud that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final site having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our Premium or Self-service. This initiative has been part of a wider commitment to move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers real choice, convenience and better quality fuel products and services. 
The Premium service that we launched on the office at a price of AED 10 per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end, in fact, of our IPO announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our Premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration levels of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC Flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium refueling customers rewards that can be deemed and were linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll-out of ADNOC Flex across all new stations that will be opened in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned, we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience stores since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3. As part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of our partnership with G√©ant. We have converted 5 stores into G√©ant  Express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 G√©ant Express stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current G√©ant stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average factory basket size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transactions that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including allied services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
On a quarter-over-quarter comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, store revitalization and promotions, including the Flex reward that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress upon our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures. Adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include Civil Aviation Supply Carve-Out, the one-off fuel site bonus that we paid in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash OpEx has actually decreased by 9.8% year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018. And has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group. Multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third-party contract renegotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we're proud that we're ahead of the $50 million of OpEx savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved to date a 10% reduction in CapEx requirements for the construction of new sites. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new sites, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of 5 stations in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
And we're on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect total CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance at the IPO of $215 million -- $250 million, I should say. This is higher though than we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by strategic acceleration in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrades, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, in particular, in quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our financial results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to, first, the pricing of fuel following the renewal of our refined products supply agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million in additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry leading margins had continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along with the significant reduction in CapEx has led to a 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual cash movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, cash flow generated from actual operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In addition, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year-end, we expect this amount whilst still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finance cost and $200 million dividends paid in April, total cash generation amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our gross cash position has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net debt-to EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x compared to 1.7x as of the 31st of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million related to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42%, and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient despite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% decrease during the third quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview by segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments this quarter with double-digit retail and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with the improved gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and aviation segments despite lower volumes. 
On the fuel and nonfuel retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year to 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also, nonfuel retail gross profit including allied services has increased by 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our corporate segment gross profit has increased by 9.1% in the third quarter year-on-year, and this is on the back of a more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
And finally, the aviation segment has benefited from the change of contractual profile with a cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The fuel and nonfuel retail segments witnessed a significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7% decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of recoverable costs related to civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting you on the revenues across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to AED 48 per liter in terms of gross margin versus around AED 0.48, sorry, versus AED 0.33. 
I just want to look at, I mean, given where the oil price backdropped, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin per liter that we can look at? I mean, if we take out the gains, you are running at around AED 0.43 per liter. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the nonfuel retail. You mentioned the gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, it's only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've established some targets in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John, you were on Bloomberg busy talking about Saudi expansion. I'm just wondering the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like ALDREES are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why Saudi at this time, unless it's a franchised model, and you're going to get a management fee?
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

I think we have been trying to be much more transparent this time in terms of the impact of oil price gains. And we said, in the quarter it was about $20 million and year-to-date $80 million. So those are the best figures we can come up with and I think they're pretty accurate. 
In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your AED 0.43, I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And your question, therefore, on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop we have, and I know backstop is a bad word at the moment across the world, but the backstop we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, in terms of absolute terms. And if oil prices were to go down significantly next year, we still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see a risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that, but we feel pretty resilient around that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period. 
In our nonfuel retail -- sorry, please go ahead."

And therefore, what I expect to see going forward as we now come out of the period and we have a much more like-for-like basis is better, pretty good in comparison year-on-year. 
That said, our conversion rate is still lower than we would like it to be. We have given guidance that our nonfuel growth profit as a percentage of our oil profit was below 10%. We're creeping up, but we -- our target is a 25% target and that remains 25% to 50% in the long run, remains our target there.

In terms of our Saudi Arabia expansion, it is a franchise model that we're going with, you're absolutely right in your observation. And what we have said is the opening of our sites to Saudi Arabia is that we wanted to actually position ourselves in Saudi Arabia with an operating license, which we have got, and we wanted to actually start to operate and to learn how to operate in Saudi Arabia. That is what the sites that we're opening will do. But it's through a franchised model and therefore it has a minimum of CapEx for us. It has, obviously, strong IRRs, but low absolute profitability when you have so fewer sites, so there is no downside risk to us there."

And what we're seeing, I can say is that the -- our ADNOC Flex penetration as we improve the uptake on rewards, et cetera, is growing, but",418,"Okay. Thank you. In terms of the penetration rate, we haven't given guidance on 2019. We're giving results on 2018. And what we're seeing, I can say is that the -- our ADNOC Flex penetration as we improve the uptake on rewards, et cetera, is growing, but we haven't got -- given a guidance for 2019 as yet. 
What we did do, though, and we were really clear is that we wanted to go in ADNOC Flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to AED 10, that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just around the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model and [we continue] to see significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of station additions. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit the number of stations we put out. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and our nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count at a reduced CapEx, a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline, but we're also mindful of any congestion, et cetera, across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment. So we feel with -- especially with ADNOC Flex and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE. And of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx, the $210 million. Our guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations, for sure, we see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say that somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx. And therefore, it is not all new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, as I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our network, but that is part of our CapEx budget. So our total CapEx budget is not all in at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the total $200 million."

In terms of the corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our gas oil business and our diesel business, in particular. And that's why, therefore, really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
What we found as a result of that is competitively  we were disadvantaged. As oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and then oil prices went up, people kind of tend to buy from us, because we had set a monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice-a-week pricing structure, which is much more in line in fairness with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we can -- we reposition our pricing, as prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margins. So it's much more dynamic and it's actually more in tune in fairness, I think, with the customers as well. And therefore, that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore, there is a level of seasonality around it in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is, and I think that is why there is some fluctuation month-to-month within that."

We see as well and we've recognized that the price at the pump has been an all-time record high, and therefore, we've seen some level of discretionary spend, and when I look at that, I'd given an example of maybe the traffic between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is reduced where people potentially stay over a little bit more and travel less. 
So we definitely have seen some cool off on that. And over the -- over Q3, it's hard to gauge population decline versus people just being out of the region. So I couldn't really comment on which one is which, because obviously, in the Q3 period, you see a significant exodus from the region."

I might look for my legal colleague, as I answer. The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10  in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not goi",614,"Okay. I might look for my legal colleague, as I answer. The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10  in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you as I look at the different Emirates, some of the Emirates are significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are lower and with the feedback we get, and I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing Premium or Self-service all with just because of a AED 10 charge. There is -- we've done the feedback and we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefit of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID and our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the stations. 
So I think we are pleased, and certainly we don't see Northern Emirates and the AED 10 charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose AED 10. We chose AED 10 at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our AED 10 is what it has allowed us to do, not just as invest but actually link it to rewards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing and driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming true in numbers all the time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade-open opportunities to our customers around Flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of rewards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is worth, I believe, in the region of AED 12.50. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time, it's also driving traffic into our convenience store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our suppliers.
So from our perspective, it makes sense. But more importantly, from a customer perspective and the rewards and a premium choice, it makes sense. In fact, a lot of the feedback we've had around the rewards program as we've changed them is -- don't understand why people just everybody doesn't go to the Flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and from our perspective, it's a win-win. 
So that's why we chose AED 10. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And our desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is the great optionality around this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."

First of all, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. 
We continue to improve and invest in safety solutions and that is evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency rate and total report of the injury during the period. 
Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continued cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and nonfuel retail expansion. 
We are on track to meet our announced targets for 2018, and we remain focused on delivering growth beyond that. I will now let John give you an update on our strategy. John?"

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us.

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also our non-fuel transactions were down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were -- was implemented in Q4 of last year, so we're just starting to grandfather that now. 
However, that said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC Flex, the ongoing expansion and preparation to expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Our G√©ant Express partnership have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
The strength of that performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA excluding inventory gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was also driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we brought down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1x as at the end of the 30th of September. 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in quarter 4 and actually will expect that may actually be 2. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in that area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transactions, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes due to the higher oil prices. 
Our ADNOC Flex initiative has been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service stations. We've set this target at our IPO and we're proud that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final site having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our Premium or Self-service. This initiative has been part of a wider commitment to move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers real choice, convenience and better quality fuel products and services. 
The Premium service that we launched on the office at a price of AED 10 per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end, in fact, of our IPO announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our Premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration levels of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC Flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium refueling customers rewards that can be deemed and were linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll-out of ADNOC Flex across all new stations that will be opened in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned, we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience stores since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3. As part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of our partnership with G√©ant. We have converted 5 stores into G√©ant Express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 G√©ant Express stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current G√©ant stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average factory basket size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transactions that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including allied services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
On a quarter-over-quarter comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, store revitalization and promotions, including the Flex reward that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress upon our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures. Adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include Civil Aviation Supply Carve-Out, the one-off fuel site bonus that we paid in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash OpEx has actually decreased by 9.8% year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018. And has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group. Multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third-party contract renegotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we're proud that we're ahead of the $50 million of OpEx savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved to date a 10% reduction in CapEx requirements for the construction of new sites. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new sites, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of 5 stations in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
And we're on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect total CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance at the IPO of $215 million -- $250 million, I should say. This is higher though than we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by strategic acceleration in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrades, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, in particular, in quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our financial results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to, first, the pricing of fuel following the renewal of our refined products supply agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million in additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry-leading margins had continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along with the significant reduction in CapEx has led to a 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual cash movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, cash flow generated from actual operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In addition, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year-end, we expect this amount whilst still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finance cost and $200 million dividends paid in April, total cash generation amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our gross cash position has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x compared to 1.7x as of the 31st of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million related to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42%, and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient despite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% decrease during the third quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview by segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments this quarter with double-digit retail and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with the improved gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and aviation segments despite lower volumes. 
On the fuel and nonfuel retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year to 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also, nonfuel retail gross profit including allied services has increased by 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our corporate segment gross profit has increased by 9.1% in the third quarter year-on-year, and this is on the back of a more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
And finally, the aviation segment has benefited from the change of contractual profile with a cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The fuel and nonfuel retail segments witnessed a significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7% decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of recoverable costs related to civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting you on the revenues across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to AED 48 per liter in terms of gross margin versus around AED 0.48, sorry, versus AED 0.33. 
I just want to look at, I mean, given where the oil price backdropped, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin per liter that we can look at? I mean, if we take out the gains, you are running at around AED 0.43 per liter. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the nonfuel retail. You mentioned the gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, it's only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've established some targets in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John, you were on Bloomberg busy talking about Saudi expansion. I'm just wondering the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like ALDREES are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why Saudi at this time, unless it's a franchised model, and you're going to get a management fee?
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

I think we have been trying to be much more transparent this time in terms of the impact of oil price gains. And we said, in the quarter it was about $20 million and year-to-date $80 million. So those are the best figures we can come up with and I think they're pretty accurate. 
In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your AED 0.43, I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And your question, therefore, on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop we have, and I know backstop is a bad word at the moment across the world, but the backstop we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, in terms of absolute terms. And if oil prices were to go down significantly next year, we still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see a risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that, but we feel pretty resilient around that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period.

And therefore, what I expect to see going forward as we now come out of the period and we have a much more like-for-like basis is better, pretty good in comparison year-on-year. 
That said, our conversion rate is still lower than we would like it to be. We have given guidance that our nonfuel growth profit as a percentage of our oil profit was below 10%. We're creeping up, but we -- our target is a 25% target and that remains 25% to 50% in the long run, remains our target there.

In terms of our Saudi Arabia expansion, it is a franchise model that we're going with, you're absolutely right in your observation. And what we have said is the opening of our sites to Saudi Arabia is that we wanted to actually position ourselves in Saudi Arabia with an operating license, which we have got, and we wanted to actually start to operate and to learn how to operate in Saudi Arabia. That is what the sites that we're opening will do. But it's through a franchised model and therefore it has a minimum of CapEx for us. It has, obviously, strong IRRs, but low absolute profitability when you have so fewer sites, so there is no downside risk to us there."

What we did do, though, and we were really clear is that we wanted to go in ADNOC Flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to AED 10, that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just around the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model and [we continue] to see significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of station additions. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit the number of stations we put out. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and our nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count at a reduced CapEx, a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline, but we're also mindful of any congestion, et cetera, across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment. So we feel with -- especially with ADNOC Flex and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE. And of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx, the $210 million. Our guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations, for sure, we see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say that somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx. And therefore, it is not all new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, as I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our network, but that is part of our CapEx budget. So our total CapEx budget is not all in at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the total $200 million."

In terms of the corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our gas oil business and our diesel business, in particular. And that's why, therefore, really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
What we found as a result of that is competitively we were disadvantaged. As oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and then oil prices went up, people kind of tend to buy from us, because we had set a monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice-a-week pricing structure, which is much more in line in fairness with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we can -- we reposition our pricing, as prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margins. So it's much more dynamic and it's actually more in tune in fairness, I think, with the customers as well. And therefore, that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore, there is a level of seasonality around it in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is, and I think that is why there is some fluctuation month-to-month within that."

We see as well and we've recognized that the price at the pump has been an all-time record high, and therefore, we've seen some level of discretionary spend, and when I look at that, I'd given an example of maybe the traffic between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is reduced where people potentially stay over a little bit more and travel less.

The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10 in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you as I look at the different Emirates, some of the Emirates are significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are lower and with the feedback we get, and I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self-service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing Premium or Self-service all with just because of a AED 10 charge. There is -- we've done the feedback and we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefit of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID and our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the stations. 
So I think we are pleased, and certainly we don't see Northern Emirates and the AED 10 charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose AED 10. We chose AED 10 at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our AED 10 is what it has allowed us to do, not just as invest but actually link it to rewards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing and driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming true in numbers all the time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade-open opportunities to our customers around Flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of rewards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is worth, I believe, in the region of AED 12.50. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time, it's also driving traffic into our convenience store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our suppliers.
So from our perspective, it makes sense. But more importantly, from a customer perspective and the rewards and a premium choice, it makes sense. In fact, a lot of the feedback we've had around the rewards program as we've changed them is -- don't understand why people just everybody doesn't go to the Flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and from our perspective, it's a win-win. 
So that's why we chose AED 10. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And our desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is the great optionality around this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."

First of all, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. 
We continue to improve and invest in safety solutions and that is evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency rate and total report of the injury during the period. 
Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continued cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and nonfuel retail expansion. 
We are on track to meet our announced targets for 2018, and we remain focused on delivering growth beyond that. I will now let John give you an update on our strategy. John?"

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us.

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also our non-fuel transactions were down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were -- was implemented in Q4 of last year, so we're just starting to grandfather that now. 
However, that said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC Flex, the ongoing expansion and preparation to expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Our G√©ant Express partnership have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
The strength of that performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA excluding inventory gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was also driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we brought down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1x as at the end of the 30th of September. 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in quarter 4 and actually will expect that may actually be 2. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in that area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transactions, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes due to the higher oil prices. 
Our ADNOC Flex initiative has been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service stations. We've set this target at our IPO and we're proud that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final site having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our Premium or Self-service. This initiative has been part of a wider commitment to move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers real choice, convenience and better quality fuel products and services. 
The Premium service that we launched on the office at a price of AED 10 per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end, in fact, of our IPO announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our Premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration levels of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC Flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium refueling customers rewards that can be deemed and were linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll-out of ADNOC Flex across all new stations that will be opened in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned, we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience stores since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3. As part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of our partnership with G√©ant. We have converted 5 stores into G√©ant Express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 G√©ant Express stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current G√©ant stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average factory basket size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transactions that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including allied services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
On a quarter-over-quarter comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, store revitalization and promotions, including the Flex reward that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress upon our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures. Adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include Civil Aviation Supply Carve-Out, the one-off fuel site bonus that we paid in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash OpEx has actually decreased by 9.8% year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018. And has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group. Multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third-party contract renegotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we're proud that we're ahead of the $50 million of OpEx savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved to date a 10% reduction in CapEx requirements for the construction of new sites. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new sites, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of 5 stations in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
And we're on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect total CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance at the IPO of $215 million -- $250 million, I should say. This is higher though than we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by strategic acceleration in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrades, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, in particular, in quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our financial results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to, first, the pricing of fuel following the renewal of our refined products supply agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million in additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry-leading margins had continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along with the significant reduction in CapEx has led to a 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual cash movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, cash flow generated from actual operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In addition, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year-end, we expect this amount whilst still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finance cost and $200 million dividends paid in April, total cash generation amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our gross cash position has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x compared to 1.7x as of the 31st of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million related to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42%, and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient despite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% decrease during the third quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview by segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments this quarter with double-digit retail and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with the improved gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and aviation segments despite lower volumes. 
On the fuel and nonfuel retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year to 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also, nonfuel retail gross profit including allied services has increased by 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our corporate segment gross profit has increased by 9.1% in the third quarter year-on-year, and this is on the back of a more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
And finally, the aviation segment has benefited from the change of contractual profile with a cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The fuel and nonfuel retail segments witnessed a significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7% decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of recoverable costs related to civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting you on the revenues across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to AED 48 per liter in terms of gross margin versus around AED 0.48, sorry, versus AED 0.33. 
I just want to look at, I mean, given where the oil price backdropped, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin per liter that we can look at? I mean, if we take out the gains, you are running at around AED 0.43 per liter. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the nonfuel retail. You mentioned the gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, it's only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've established some targets in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John, you were on Bloomberg busy talking about Saudi expansion. I'm just wondering the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like ALDREES are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why Saudi at this time, unless it's a franchised model, and you're going to get a management fee?
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

I think we have been trying to be much more transparent this time in terms of the impact of oil price gains. And we said, in the quarter it was about $20 million and year-to-date $80 million. So those are the best figures we can come up with and I think they're pretty accurate. 
In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your AED 0.43, I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And your question, therefore, on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop we have, and I know backstop is a bad word at the moment across the world, but the backstop we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, in terms of absolute terms. And if oil prices were to go down significantly next year, we still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see a risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that, but we feel pretty resilient around that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period.

And therefore, what I expect to see going forward as we now come out of the period and we have a much more like-for-like basis is better, pretty good in comparison year-on-year. 
That said, our conversion rate is still lower than we would like it to be. We have given guidance that our nonfuel growth profit as a percentage of our oil profit was below 10%. We're creeping up, but we -- our target is a 25% target and that remains 25% to 50% in the long run, remains our target there.

In terms of our Saudi Arabia expansion, it is a franchise model that we're going with, you're absolutely right in your observation. And what we have said is the opening of our sites to Saudi Arabia is that we wanted to actually position ourselves in Saudi Arabia with an operating license, which we have got, and we wanted to actually start to operate and to learn how to operate in Saudi Arabia. That is what the sites that we're opening will do. But it's through a franchised model and therefore it has a minimum of CapEx for us. It has, obviously, strong IRRs, but low absolute profitability when you have so fewer sites, so there is no downside risk to us there."

And then the next question is on CapEx. So I believe, we said that from around $210 million of CapEx this year on around 13 stations, we were looking for up to 40% reduction in construction cost per station next year, so that will bring CapEx down to around $100 million to $120 million.

What we did do, though, and we were really clear is that we wanted to go in ADNOC Flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to AED 10, that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just around the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model and [we continue] to see significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of station additions. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit the number of stations we put out. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and our nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count at a reduced CapEx, a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline, but we're also mindful of any congestion, et cetera, across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment. So we feel with -- especially with ADNOC Flex and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE. And of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx, the $210 million. Our guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations, for sure, we see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say that somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx. And therefore, it is not all new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, as I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our network, but that is part of our CapEx budget. So our total CapEx budget is not all in at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the total $200 million."

In terms of the corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our gas oil business and our diesel business, in particular. And that's why, therefore, really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
What we found as a result of that is competitively we were disadvantaged. As oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and then oil prices went up, people kind of tend to buy from us, because we had set a monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice-a-week pricing structure, which is much more in line in fairness with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we can -- we reposition our pricing, as prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margins. So it's much more dynamic and it's actually more in tune in fairness, I think, with the customers as well. And therefore, that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore, there is a level of seasonality around it in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is, and I think that is why there is some fluctuation month-to-month within that."

We see as well and we've recognized that the price at the pump has been an all-time record high, and therefore, we've seen some level of discretionary spend, and when I look at that, I'd given an example of maybe the traffic between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is reduced where people potentially stay over a little bit more and travel less.

The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10 in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you as I look at the different Emirates, some of the Emirates are significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are lower and with the feedback we get, and I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self-service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing Premium or Self-service all with just because of a AED 10 charge. There is -- we've done the feedback and we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefit of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID and our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the stations. 
So I think we are pleased, and certainly we don't see Northern Emirates and the AED 10 charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose AED 10. We chose AED 10 at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our AED 10 is what it has allowed us to do, not just as invest but actually link it to rewards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing and driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming true in numbers all the time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade-open opportunities to our customers around Flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of rewards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is worth, I believe, in the region of AED 12.50. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time, it's also driving traffic into our convenience store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our suppliers.
So from our perspective, it makes sense. But more importantly, from a customer perspective and the rewards and a premium choice, it makes sense. In fact, a lot of the feedback we've had around the rewards program as we've changed them is -- don't understand why people just everybody doesn't go to the Flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and from our perspective, it's a win-win. 
So that's why we chose AED 10. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And our desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is the great optionality around this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."

Regarding the results, the third quarter has been marked by strong financial performance, driven by operational improvement and continued progress on the 3 pillars of our strategy. 
Our EBITDA is up 42% versus the third quarter of last year, and we are consistently generating more free cash flow than we did 1 year ago. 
This quarter, free cash flow is up 59% compared to the third quarter last year. The strong performance has been underpinned by continued cost efficiency improvements as well as fuel and nonfuel retail expansion.

And good morning, good afternoon. Welcome to everybody on the call. Thank you for joining us. I just want to give you a brief overview of the quarter, and then I know Petri is going to take you through the financials, we'll take some questions. But as you're probably aware, the oil price has increased during this quarter, in addition to that has been a prolonged Eid holidays in August and that has led to fuel retail volumes being down by 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Also our non-fuel transactions were down 15.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, impacted particularly by the implementation of that and the increased tobacco tax and sugar tax on energy and soft drinks that were -- was implemented in Q4 of last year, so we're just starting to grandfather that now. 
However, that said, during this quarter, we as a business has continued to focus on the fuel retail and nonfuel retail and cost efficiency initiatives. Those are 3 areas and 3 buckets we continually talk about, and we've achieved some important and significant milestones during the quarter. 
In particular, the rollout of ADNOC Flex, the ongoing expansion and preparation to expansion into Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Our G√©ant Express partnership have all shown significant progress in the quarter. 
And together with the structural resilience of our business model, this has led to a strong year-on-year financial performance in Q3. 
The strength of that performance has been demonstrated by gross profits, up by 26.5%. Our EBITDA excluding inventory gains was up 26%, and up 42% including those gains. 
And the generation of $899 million of free cash flow pre-dividends and finance cost in the first 9 months of 2018, showed a strong result. And this was also driven by our operational performance as well as active working capital management. 
That said, we brought down the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.1x as at the end of the 30th of September. 
So that's the very quick and high-level overview. Let me take you and give you a little bit more detail around the 3 sectors I talked about. 
Starting with the fuel retail business. In 2018, we continued our growth expansion with the opening of 5 new service stations since the beginning of the year. That brings our total number of fuel stations to 364 across 
[Technical Difficulty] 
graphic expansion. We're happy to say that we're on track to open 13 new service stations in 2018 as initially targeted, of which 3 stations will be opened in Dubai over the next few weeks. 
On top of that, we're planning to open at least 1 new station in Saudi Arabia in quarter 4 and actually will expect that may actually be 2. 
And our expansion into Dubai, we will continue to deliver further growth in that area during 2019. 
During this quarter, we've also witnessed a 2.2% year-on-year increase in fuel transactions, and that's really been driven by customers fueling more frequently, but at lower average volumes due to the higher oil prices. 
Our ADNOC Flex initiative has been successfully rolled out across our entire network now of service stations. We've set this target at our IPO and we're proud that we've actually delivered this milestone ahead of target, with the final site having been rolled out during October. 
Today, our retail customers are now able to choose between our Premium or Self-service. This initiative has been part of a wider commitment to move to a smarter, customer-centric market, that offers our customers real choice, convenience and better quality fuel products and services. 
The Premium service that we launched on the office at a price of AED 10 per transaction, which was at the high end, at the top end, in fact, of our IPO announcement, and it's been positively received in the market. 
Indeed our Premium fueling service has experienced initial penetration levels of 20% on average during the third quarter. 
At the end of the last quarter, together with the launch of ADNOC Flex and as part of our management initiative to improve customer service, we also launched a rewards program. 
Giving those premium refueling customers rewards that can be deemed and were linked to our convenience stores. 
As planned, we will also continue our footprint expansion and roll-out of ADNOC Flex across all new stations that will be opened in the future. 
Let's move on then to nonfuel retail. As mentioned, we continue to progress on the implementation of our nonfuel retail initiatives. 
We've added 6 new convenience stores since the beginning of the year, leading to a total now of 241 convenience stores at the end of Q3. As part of management initiatives to improve customer shopping experience, products and service quality, we continue to revitalize and refurbish our existing convenience stores. 
Some notable highlights are that since the beginning of the year and as part of our partnership with G√©ant. We have converted 5 stores into G√©ant Express, and we will build or convert 8 additional locations by the end of this year, that will give us 13 G√©ant Express stores in 2018, compared to the 10 announced during the last quarter. 
An initial operation result of our current G√©ant stores have been very encouraging. We've also introduced a new coffee and fresh bakery concept to newly branded Oasis Caf√©. And we started with 4 shops. 
And this overall revitalization process has increased our average factory basket size by 22% year-on-year in Q3, up from about 18% in Q2. And therefore, despite the 15.6% decrease year-on-year in the nonfuel transactions that I spoke about, I'm really pleased to say that our nonfuel retail growth profit, including allied services is actually up 8.1% year-on-year in Q3. 
On a quarter-over-quarter comparison, we've reported higher nonfuel retail transactions and conversion rates versus the second quarter of 2018 on the back of better product category management, store revitalization and promotions, including the Flex reward that I talked about earlier. 
And we remain very confident that we will continue to see continued progress upon our announced initiative during Q4. 
Finally, let's move on to the cost efficiency. We continue to achieve good progress in managing our operational and CapEx expenditures. Adjusted for nonrecurring spent, which we would include Civil Aviation Supply Carve-Out, the one-off fuel site bonus that we paid in June and the restructuring cost. 
Our cash OpEx has actually decreased by 9.8% year-on-year, during the third quarter 2018. And has decreased 2.9% in the 9 months to the end of September. 
The team has been focused on delivering cost discipline across the group. Multiple cost reduction initiatives have been implemented, including targeting strategic sourcing and third-party contract renegotiations. And these have led to impressive results. 
So we're proud that we're ahead of the $50 million of OpEx savings that we targeted on a like-for-like basis for 2018. 
On our capital expenditure front, we've achieved to date a 10% reduction in CapEx requirements for the construction of new sites. We're aiming to go further and achieve that reduction of up to 40% in the cost of new sites, starting in 2019. 
To date, we spent $143 million, including the opening of 5 stations in 2018, which on an adjusted basis is 18.2% lower compared to the first 9 months of 2017. 
And we're on track to open additional stations before the end of the year, which leads to a total of 13 stations in 2018 and a further station at least in Saudi Arabia. 
Looking at the outlook for 2018, we expect total CapEx for the year of up to $210 million, which is below our guidance at the IPO of $215 million -- $250 million, I should say. This is higher though than we announced last quarter, which was the CapEx target of $190 million. But the extra $20 million is only driven by strategic acceleration in Dubai and technology and infrastructure upgrades, which were originally planned for 2019. 
I hope that gives you a feel and an overview for our progress to date, in particular, in quarter 3 of 2018. And I'd now like to hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

All the initiatives mentioned by John earlier have had a positive impact on our financial results. Our EBITDA performance has strongly increased during both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And this is due to, first, the pricing of fuel following the renewal of our refined products supply agreement with ADNOC. 
And second, inventory gains driven by higher oil prices, leading to $21 million in additional EBITDA in the third quarter and $80 million additional EBITDA since the beginning of the year. 
Our underlying EBITDA performance, excluding inventory gains has also significantly increased by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter 2018. 
It is also important to note that our industry-leading margins had continued to improve on the back of our cost efficiency initiatives. 
Overall, this strong profitable improvement along with the significant reduction in CapEx has led to a 67.6% year-on-year increase in our adjusted free cash flow, defined as EBITDA minus CapEx. 
Let me specifically now talk about the reported actual cash movements during the first 9 months of the year. 
As John pointed out earlier, cash flow generated from actual operations amounted during the 9 months to $586 million. In addition, $432 million have been generated from working capital, and this is mainly driven by the increase in our credit terms as part of our supply agreement with ADNOC from 30 days to 60 days. 
At year-end, we expect this amount whilst still significant to be slightly lower than the Q3 figure. And finally, including finance cost and $200 million dividends paid in April, total cash generation amounted to $680 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Our gross cash position has increased to $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and this is resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x compared to 1.7x as of the 31st of last year in December. 
And finally, on November 1, we paid our shareholders the first dividend transfer of $200 million related to fiscal year 2018 as an interim dividend. And this is leading to a total amount of $400 million paid to our shareholders during calendar year 2018. 
Let me highlight a couple of key takeaways in terms of financial and operational metrics. 
As you can see, we've witnessed strong financial results during the third quarter, gross profit is up by 26.5%. EBITDA stated 42%, and net income 55% year-on-year. 
This performance has been resilient despite market headwinds, leading to 5.3% decrease during the third quarter in total fuel volume served with retail fuel volumes down 5.6% year-on-year. 
Let me now move on to give you a more detailed overview by segments. 
We have witnessed strong year-on-year gross profit growth across all segments this quarter with double-digit retail and aviation growth of 33.7% and 34.8%, respectively. This growth has been coupled with the improved gross profit margin across fuel and nonfuel retail and aviation segments despite lower volumes. 
On the fuel and nonfuel retail segment gross profit margin has increased by 200 basis points, year-on-year to 21.1% in the third quarter. 
Also, nonfuel retail gross profit including allied services has increased by 8.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Our corporate segment gross profit has increased by 9.1% in the third quarter year-on-year, and this is on the back of a more proactive fuel pricing, particularly in our diesel. 
And finally, the aviation segment has benefited from the change of contractual profile with a cost plus 8% compensation from our parent company. 
A couple of takeaways with respect to EBITDA per segment. The fuel and nonfuel retail segments witnessed a significant increase in EBITDA, which almost doubled year-on-year. 
And this was driven by the continuous implementation of our cost initiatives. The cost monitoring has also led to an improvement of regional EBITDA margin by 420 basis points to 10.9%. 
The 21.7% decrease in aviation EBITDA during the third quarter was impacted by lower volumes and the inclusion of recoverable costs related to civil aviation fueling services. With that, let me now hand over to Saeed for the outlook."

First one is on the fuel margin. I mean, clearly the higher oil prices are benefiting you on the revenues across the different segments, but if we just do some calculation, I think you've mentioned the number in terms of inventory gain, I am getting something closer to AED 48 per liter in terms of gross margin versus around AED 0.48, sorry, versus AED 0.33. 
I just want to look at, I mean, given where the oil price backdropped, I mean, in 2, 3 quarters, we might have a different discussion and oil prices are down and these inventory gains might move into losses. 
So my question is what is the sustainable gross margin per liter that we can look at? I mean, if we take out the gains, you are running at around AED 0.43 per liter. 
Does this make sense? Am I missing something here? So this is my first question. The second question, if I may, on the nonfuel retail. You mentioned the gross profit with the allied services, but if we take the allied services out, the numbers are much more muted in terms of growth, it's only up 3% in Q3. 
And just looking at the numbers, nonfuel transactions are down, basket size is up, conversion ratio is down year-over-year.
So I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, are you happy with the performance of the nonfuel retail? Is there any guidance or targets that you have in mind that you want to reach, because I remember at the time of the IPO, you've established some targets in terms of conversion ratio, but clearly, you're still well, well below those. So any updates on that? 
And finally, John, you were on Bloomberg busy talking about Saudi expansion. I'm just wondering the model for this expansion now given that the pricing hasn't changed. Your peers in Saudi Arabia, like ALDREES are struggling with an EBIT margin of around maybe 3%, 4% on fuel, while you guys are sitting at double digits. So why Saudi at this time, unless it's a franchised model, and you're going to get a management fee?
Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions. But that's it from my end."

I think we have been trying to be much more transparent this time in terms of the impact of oil price gains. And we said, in the quarter it was about $20 million and year-to-date $80 million. So those are the best figures we can come up with and I think they're pretty accurate. 
In terms of our fuel margin behind that, I think, if you back those out and you get to your AED 0.43, I think, that's a reasonable target. 
And your question, therefore, on oil prices going down. I think that plays very strongly to the backstop we have, and I know backstop is a bad word at the moment across the world, but the backstop we have in terms of our margin. 
So don't forget we have a guaranteed margin. And that margin is guaranteed by the government, in terms of absolute terms. And if oil prices were to go down significantly next year, we still have that guaranteed margin to ADNOC as well. 
So we don't see a risk over an annual period, a 12-month period, on oil prices. If oil prices were to go down significantly in quarter 4, we would have some impact on that, but we feel pretty resilient around that. 
Hope that answers the question, but I think it's a bad thing. Yes, we captured the upside, and we don't lose the downside over the 12-month period.

And therefore, what I expect to see going forward as we now come out of the period and we have a much more like-for-like basis is better, pretty good in comparison year-on-year. 
That said, our conversion rate is still lower than we would like it to be. We have given guidance that our nonfuel growth profit as a percentage of our oil profit was below 10%. We're creeping up, but we -- our target is a 25% target and that remains 25% to 50% in the long run, remains our target there.

In terms of our Saudi Arabia expansion, it is a franchise model that we're going with, you're absolutely right in your observation. And what we have said is the opening of our sites to Saudi Arabia is that we wanted to actually position ourselves in Saudi Arabia with an operating license, which we have got, and we wanted to actually start to operate and to learn how to operate in Saudi Arabia. That is what the sites that we're opening will do. But it's through a franchised model and therefore it has a minimum of CapEx for us. It has, obviously, strong IRRs, but low absolute profitability when you have so fewer sites, so there is no downside risk to us there."

The second question is on the number of station additions, do you think you could revisit the number of station additions in the UAE, given the demand dynamics in the UAE this year? Or are we still looking for around 10 stations per annum 2019 onwards? 
And then the next question is on CapEx. So I believe, we said that from around $210 million of CapEx this year on around 13 stations, we were looking for up to 40% reduction in construction cost per station next year, so that will bring CapEx down to around $100 million to $120 million.

Thank you. In terms of the penetration rate, we haven't given guidance on 2019. We're giving results on 2018.

And what we're seeing, I can say is that the -- our ADNOC Flex penetration as we improve the uptake on rewards, et cetera, is growing, but we haven't got -- given a guidance for 2019 as yet. 
What we did do, though, and we were really clear is that we wanted to go in ADNOC Flex at the top end of the range, which is why we went to AED 10, that allows us to create a huge amount of optionality, not just around the penetration rate as well, but also the opportunity for cost reduction around our business model and [we continue] to see significant upside for 2019. 
In terms of station additions. It's a great question, and I think we continuously revisit the number of stations we put out. We have our investment criteria that we come back to. And what we see as we grow our convenience stores and our nonfuel business that actually increasing our station count at a reduced CapEx, a strong return still across the UAE. 
We are very mindful of the volume decline, but we're also mindful of any congestion, et cetera, across the business. 
So we are balancing those 2 at the moment. So we feel with -- especially with ADNOC Flex and our reduced model that there is still space for us to grow across the UAE. And of course, grow in particular across Dubai. 
Your third question on CapEx, the $210 million. Our guidance for next year remains below $200 million. Our 13 stations, for sure, we see -- expect to see a reduced reduction in CapEx from those and that will flow to a reduction in the overall CapEx budget. 
However, I would say that somewhere in the region of $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is maintenance and kind of ongoing CapEx. And therefore, it is not all new growth. 
So our guidance is trying to be -- we're trying to reduce our maintenance CapEx, but today, it's in the region of $50 million to $60 million. 
And we, as I said earlier, putting in infrastructure projects as well to help reduce our overall cost of our network, but that is part of our CapEx budget. So our total CapEx budget is not all in at new stations. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to take the 40% reduction on the total $200 million."

In terms of the corporate sector. Let me, kind of, I guess, the best comparison I can give you is what we used to do versus what we do today. 
What we used to do in terms of prior year results was we actually set a monthly pricing around our gas oil business and our diesel business, in particular. And that's why, therefore, really acted as the benchmark price across at the industry. 
What we found as a result of that is competitively we were disadvantaged. As oil prices went down, we were competitively disadvantaged and then oil prices went up, people kind of tend to buy from us, because we had set a monthly price. 
We now have a more dynamic, probably twice-a-week pricing structure, which is much more in line in fairness with the industry. It's much more of a spot pricing. 
What that means is that actually it is a balance between volume and margin and therefore as the prices go up, we can -- we reposition our pricing, as prices come down we actually maximize also some of the margins. So it's much more dynamic and it's actually more in tune in fairness, I think, with the customers as well. And therefore, that is what has led to where we are. In terms of your questions on the profit and the unit margin, the corporate sector is a very wide sector, it ranges from diesel to trucks, to industrial, to power generation, et cetera. And therefore, there is a level of seasonality around it in terms of where you make your margin and where your pricing is, and I think that is why there is some fluctuation month-to-month within that."

We see as well and we've recognized that the price at the pump has been an all-time record high, and therefore, we've seen some level of discretionary spend, and when I look at that, I'd given an example of maybe the traffic between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is reduced where people potentially stay over a little bit more and travel less.

The first -- second question, but let me try the first one first, which is around Flex, AED 10 in Northern Emirates. We launched it in Northern Emirates in September. I can tell you, and I'm not going to give you specifics, but I can tell you as I look at the different Emirates, some of the Emirates are significantly higher penetration than Abu Dhabi and some are lower and with the feedback we get, and I think people should also recognize them. This is about choice and this is about self-service. This is about ease of use. And therefore, people are not choosing Premium or Self-service all with just because of a AED 10 charge. There is -- we've done the feedback and we've talked to the customers. And some customers just like the benefit of having a self-service, and particularly, with our FID and our technology advances the speed at which they can get in and out of the stations. 
So I think we are pleased, and certainly we don't see Northern Emirates and the AED 10 charge being restrictive. 
We are very comfortable with choices our customers are making. Your question was on why did we choose AED 10. We chose AED 10 at the high end, because we actually want to give our customers a real clear choice. And what we have done in our AED 10 is what it has allowed us to do, not just as invest but actually link it to rewards and what's really positive is the rewards uptake across the premium. it's well over 50%. 
And if you look at that, if you look at what we're doing and driving traffic, and you will see this, I believe, coming true in numbers all the time. 
We're driving traffic into our convenience stores, and we're able to link and offer very significant trade-open opportunities to our customers around Flex. And I'll just give you one very simple example of rewards that we've given. 
We offered a 12-pack of water-free with premium service. And that is worth, I believe, in the region of AED 12.50. 
Obviously, we make a good margin on that, but from a consumer perspective, it's getting premium for free. If you want water and at the same time, it's also driving traffic into our convenience store, and it's allowing us more leverage with our suppliers.
So from our perspective, it makes sense. But more importantly, from a customer perspective and the rewards and a premium choice, it makes sense. In fact, a lot of the feedback we've had around the rewards program as we've changed them is -- don't understand why people just everybody doesn't go to the Flex, because you're actually getting your money back, and from our perspective, it's a win-win. 
So that's why we chose AED 10. It gives us that huge amount of optionality in what we can do and how we can link with our customers. 
Your question on dividends and your question on 0.1. We are really proud of our cash generation at year-to-date. We are also very cognizant of 2 things. One is our responsibility to use that cash wisely as we grow our business, and we have a number of opportunities with that. And our desire to be able to communicate with it. 
Do we feel you can improve our dividend policy and grow? 
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And I think that is the great optionality around this business, but we believe this business, first and foremost, can grow significantly, and we believe we have plenty of headwind to do that."
