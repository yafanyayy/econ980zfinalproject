Loews had a strong quarter and a good year with each of our subsidiaries contributing to our overall success. Our CFO, David Edelson, will go into the details about our results later in the call as well as discussing the implications of the recently passed tax cuts for Loews and our subsidiaries. Before he does, however, I'd like to talk about CNA and share repurchases. 
CNA has steadily improved over the past 15 years under a series of strong leadership teams. The company has taken steps to focus on its core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by transforming itself from a not so focused multiline insurance company into a highly focused commercial property/casualty Company. This transformation obviously didn't happen overnight and in fact, it required enormous effort and discipline by the management teams at both CNA and Loews. 
Specifically, from 1999 to 2010, CNA disposed of a number of its businesses, including reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance and group health. Additionally, the company reinsured its asbestos and pollution liabilities to reduce balance sheet risk. 
Since joining the company in November of 2016 as CEO, Dino Robusto has turbocharged CNA's evolution. On his leadership, the CNA team has been pulling a number of levers to improve underwriting performance. They have enhanced risk selection, retooled their claims department and continued to upgrade their underwriting talent. CNA has provided a stable market for agents and brokers, a factor in the company's ability to strengthen its relationship with distributors and a time of industry change. 
And the company has focused intently on reducing a success ratio while also investing in the business. Dino and the team at CNA believe that there is even more room for improvement in each of these areas, and we agree. Also, CNA continues to actively manage its long-term care book of business, mitigating risk by diligently managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when necessary. Additionally, CNA is exploring new strategies to lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders. 
On the talent front, CNA added significantly to its bench in 2017 across many areas, including underwriting, technology, operations and claims. All of these new senior executives are highly successful industry veterans with outstanding track record and expertise. 
Earlier today, in light of CNA's 2017 results, its fortress balance sheet and the CNA Board's outlook, CNA announced the $0.30 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. In March of this year, Loews will receive $558 million in dividends from CNA. And over the last 4 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received $3.2 billion in dividends from CNA. 
As we look back over the last decade, CNA's success comes as no surprise to Loews. Although we understood that it would take time and lots of hard work to turn CNA around, we had a vision for what the company could be and help steadfast to that vision. Also and very importantly, we were able to recruit the right CEO for each stage of CNA's evolution. 
To sum up, we believe that the company is poised to continue to profitably and responsibly grow its business and that moving forward, CNA can and will deliver even stronger operating results. 
Moving on from CNA, I want to give a quick update on share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.6 million Loews shares at a cost of about $230 million. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2018 when we purchased another 4.3 million shares through February 9. With the benefit of 2020 hindsight, we could have bought more shares over the last 2 years. However, since the third quarter, we've bought back almost 9 million shares, representing almost 3% of the company. We began repurchasing our stock because of a wide discount between of the stock price and our assessment of the intrinsic sum of the parts valuation. Additionally, we believe that CNA will continue to grow and prosper and that the outlook for our 4 others businesses is improving. 
Looking beyond the past year or 2, in the past decade, we have acquired almost 40% of our outstanding shares, continuing our nearly half-century practice of substantial share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,550363396,1388418,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2018",2018-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net b",1168,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage in December of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The benefit, which had no cash impact, stems largely from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability. 
Absent the $200 million benefit, our net income was $281 million or $0.83 per share, down $9 million from last year's fourth quarter. Before I discuss the drivers of fourth quarter net income, I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7 of our earnings release and Page 5 of our earnings supplement, where we show the impact of tax reform by reporting segment for the fourth quarter and full year. 
Let me briefly summarize the impact by segment. CNA booked a charge in the fourth quarter as it wrote down its deferred tax asset due to the lower tax rate. In 2018 and beyond, tax reform should be quite positive for CNA. For Diamond itself, tax reform had offsetting impacts. The company benefited as it wrote down its deferred tax liability because of the lower tax rate, while it also took a charge for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. I would note that this charge had no cash impact. 
At the Loews level, however, we did book a charge in the Diamond segment, reflecting the impact of changing tax rates on the differential between our book basis and tax basis in Diamond. As a reminder, Diamond is not included in our consolidated tax return. 
For Boardwalk, Loews booked a substantial benefit as the lower tax rate caused us to write down the deferred tax liability we had built up over the past decade from Boardwalk's capital projects. And for Loews Hotels, we also benefited from the lower tax rate through the write-down of a deferred tax liability. 
Going forward, excluding any changes in marketplace behavior, corporate tax reform, especially the reduction in the federal corporate rate, should be positive for Loews on a consolidated basis. 
Turning to the quarter. Rather than plow through each segments year-over-year quarterly variance, let me instead highlight the key drivers of fourth quarter earnings and what caused the slight decline from Q4 2016. These highlights will exclude the previously noted impact of tax reform. 
Diamond Offshore drove our slight year-to-year earnings decline with net income contribution down $74 million from Q4 2016. Contract drilling revenues were up 12% and rig margin declined substantially, largely due to fewer rigs working and lower day rates on recontracted rigs. 
In addition, during the quarter, the company impaired one of its rigs and booked restructuring and separation cost as it continues to aggressively manage its expense base. 
On the bright side, CNA had a strong quarter to top off a strong year. Its quarterly net income contribution was up $54 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a substantial increase in underwriting income. 
CNA posted a combined ratio of 94 in Q4 2017, down from 99.9 in last year's fourth quarter. As a reminder, when it comes to combined ratios, lower is better. 
Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved from 98.3 to 95.8. And for the full year, the underlying combined ratio is 95.5, down 2.4 points from 97.9 in 2016. Jim mentioned the focus at CNA on underwriting excellence as a key lever to improving underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter and full year combined ratios demonstrate the progress being made. 
Another bright spot was Loews Hotels, which posted net income of $13 million in Q4, up from $5 million last year. The joint ventures at the Universal Orlando Resort posted excellent results, as is the Loews Miami Beach, which was just completing our renovation during last year's fourth quarter. As Jim outlined during last quarter's remarks, Loews Hotels appears to be hitting its stride operationally and strategically. 
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was essentially flat on the quarter, as were the earnings generated by the parent company investment portfolio. Corporate, which includes our newest subsidiary consolidated container, improved versus the prior year, largely due to the timing of compensation accruals. 
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. Loews reported 2017 net income of $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share, up from $654 million or $1.93 per share last year. Excluding the $200 million net benefit related to tax reform, our net income was $964 million or $2.86 per share, up $310 million from the prior year. Again, rather than walk through each segment in detail, let me highlight a few key drivers at the substantial year-over-year increase. 
Lower rig impairments at Diamond Offshore accounted for $235 million of the earnings improvement. Excluding impairments, Diamond's earnings contribution declined $40 million year-over-year, reflecting the weaker operating environment and some unusual items. CNA, in the aggregate, accounted for $105 million of the increase, attributable mainly to improvements in noncat underwriting income and Life & Group results. 
Additionally, 2016 results were impacted by adverse development related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. Net investment income and realized gains were also up over the prior year. Partially offsetting these improvements were elevated catastrophe losses in 2017, given the high incidence of natural catastrophes during the year. 
Loews Hotels contributed to the net income increase, thanks to improving operator performance and a gain on the sale of a joint-venture hotel property in 2017. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year. However, absent the loss Boardwalk took in 2017 on the sale of a processing facility, its net income contribution would have been up $12 million.
Parent company net investment income was flat year-over-year and the elevated cost in corporate and other for full year 2017 are almost entirely attributable to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of consolidated container. 
We continue to maintain an extremely strong liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.9 billion with 57% in cash and equivalents, 20% in healthy investments, 13% fixed maturities and 10% marketable equity securities. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $804 million from CNA and Boardwalk with CNA contributing the lion share of that amount. 
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.30 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive approximately $560 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 4.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $231 million. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for $218 million. Shares outstanding, adjusted for all share repurchase activity, currently stand at around 328 million. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

And I cannot think of a time in Loews' history where we have had a more talented and effective group of such individuals. 
I've already mentioned Dino Robusto's supercharged performance at CNA. Needless to say, we are thrilled with his leadership and the direction in which he's taking the company. All of our CEOs are equally outstanding. Marc Edwards at Diamond continues to expertly steer the company through a protracted downturn in the offshore drilling industry, maintaining Diamond's financial stability while differentiating the company from its competition. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best CEOs in the midstream market. With his strategic vision and deep industry knowledge, Boardwalk is working to mitigate its recontracting risk while adding profitable organic growth projects. Sean Foreman, the CEO of our newest subsidiary, CCC, has demonstrated his forward-looking approach and extensive expertise in the packaging industry, and we have great expectations for his leadership of the company. And finally, we have the highest level of confidence in Jon Tisch, the CEO of Loews Hotels. Under John, Loews Hotels has embarked upon a new strategic direction by focusing on what we do best, group travel and immersive destination. 
While Loews is a holding company, we don't have a lot of bureaucracy. We put the right people in leadership positions at our subsidiaries and let them do their jobs. Where we have engaged with our subsidiaries are the areas where we think we can add value, such as major capital allocation decisions, accessing the capital markets and the ratification of our subsidiaries mid- to long-term strategies. This approach has stirred low shareholders very well over the past 15 years, and we expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. And now back to Mary."

The demand is there, I think, because the projects that we're doing where we are seeing work are development projects where there can be a quick payback to the capital investment in the project. My strong guess is that in the coming year, we're also going to start to see a pickup in inquiry for drillships, which generally tend to do work that takes longer to generate cash returns for the oil companies. But there's no doubt that they have seriously underinvested in productive oil capacity. And I think the move up in oil prices reflects that underinvestment in productive capacity. And my general guess is that oil will continue to move up, tempting oil companies to start to spend more of their exploration and production."

Loews had a strong quarter and a good year with each of our subsidiaries contributing to our overall success. Our CFO, David Edelson, will go into the details about our results later in the call as well as discussing the implications of the recently passed tax cuts for Loews and our subsidiaries. Before he does, however, I'd like to talk about CNA and share repurchases.
CNA has steadily improved over the past 15 years under a series of strong leadership teams. The company has taken steps to focus on its core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by transforming itself from a not-so-focused multi-line insurance company into a highly focused commercial property/casualty company. This transformation, obviously, didn't happen overnight, and in fact, it required enormous effort and discipline by the management teams at both CNA and Loews.
Specifically, from 1999 to 2010, CNA disposed of a number of its businesses, including reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance and group health. Additionally, the company reinsured its asbestos and pollution liabilities to reduce balance sheet risk.
Since joining the company in November of 2016 as CEO, Dino Robusto has turbocharged CNA's evolution. On his leadership, the CNA team has been pulling a number of levers to improve underwriting performance. They have enhanced risk selection, retooled their claims department and continued to upgrade their underwriting talent. CNA has provided a stable market for agents and brokers, a factor in the company's ability to strengthen its relationships with distributors in a time of industry change. And the company has focused intently on reducing its expense ratio while also investing in the business. Dino and the team at CNA believe that there is even more room for improvement in each of these areas, and we agree.
Also, CNA continues to actively manage its long-term care book of business, mitigating risk by diligently managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when necessary. Additionally, CNA is exploring new strategies to lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders.
On the talent front, CNA added significantly to its bench in 2017 across many areas, including underwriting, technology, operations and claims. All of these new senior executives are highly successful industry veterans with outstanding track record and expertise.
Earlier today, in light of CNA's 2017 results, its fortress balance sheet and the CNA Board's outlook, CNA announced a $0.30 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. In March of this year, Loews will receive $558 million in dividends from CNA. And over the last 4 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received $3.2 billion in dividends from CNA.
As we look back over the last decade, CNA's success comes as no surprise to Loews. Although we understood that it would take time and lots of hard work to turn CNA around, we had a vision for what the company could be and help steadfast to that vision. Also and very importantly, we were able to recruit the right CEO for each stage of CNA's evolution.
To sum up, we believe that the company is poised to continue to profitably and responsibly grow its business and, that moving forward, CNA can and will deliver even stronger operating results.
Moving on from CNA, I want to give a quick update on share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.6 million Loews shares at a cost of about $230 million. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2018 when we purchased another 4.3 million shares through February 9. With the benefit of 2020 hindsight, we could have bought more shares over the last 2 years. However, since the third quarter, we've bought back almost 9 million shares, representing almost 3% of the company. We began repurchasing our stock because of a wide discount between the stock price and our assessment of the intrinsic sum of the parts valuation. Additionally, we believe that CNA will continue to grow and prosper, and that the outlook for our 4 others businesses is improving.
Looking beyond the past year or 2, in the past decade, we have acquired almost 40% of our outstanding shares, continuing our nearly half-century practice of substantial share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,550363396,1388464,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2018",2018-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net b",1171,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage in December of the tax cut and jobs act. The benefit, which had no cash impact, stemed largely from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability.
Absent the $200 million benefit, our net income was $281 million or $0.83 per share, down $9 million from last year's fourth quarter. Before I discuss the drivers of fourth quarter net income, I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7 of our earnings release and Page 5 of our earnings supplement where we show the impact of tax reform by reporting segment for the fourth quarter and full year.
Let me briefly summarize the impact by segment. CNA booked a charge in the fourth quarter as it wrote down its deferred tax asset due to the lower tax rate. In 2018 and beyond, tax reform should be quite positive for CNA. For Diamond itself, tax reform had offsetting impacts. The company benefited as it wrote down its deferred tax liability because of the lower tax rate, while it also took a charge for the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. I would note that this charge had no cash impact.
At the Loews level, however, we did book a charge in the Diamond segment, reflecting the impact of changing tax rates on the differential between our book basis and tax basis in Diamond. As a reminder, Diamond is not included in our consolidated tax return.
For Boardwalk, Loews booked a substantial benefit as the lower tax rate caused us to write down the deferred tax liability we had built up over the past decade from Boardwalk's capital projects. And for Loews Hotels, we also benefited from the lower tax rate through the write-down of a deferred tax liability.
Going forward, excluding any changes in marketplace behavior, corporate tax reform, especially the reduction in the federal corporate rate, should be positive for Loews on a consolidated basis.
Turning to the quarter. Rather than plow through each segments' year-over-year quarterly variance, let me instead highlight the key drivers of fourth quarter earnings and what caused the slight decline from Q4 2016. These highlights will exclude the previously noted impact of tax reform.
Diamond Offshore drove our slight year-to-year earnings decline with net income contribution down $74 million from Q4 2016. Contract drilling revenues were up 12% and rig margin declined substantially, largely due to fewer rigs working and lower day rates on recontracted rigs. In addition, during the quarter, the company impaired one of its rigs and booked restructuring and separation costs as it continues to aggressively manage its expense base.
On the bright side, CNA had a strong quarter to top off a strong year. Its quarterly net income contribution was up $54 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a substantial increase in underwriting income.
CNA posted a combined ratio of 94 in Q4 2017, down from 99.9 in last year's fourth quarter. As a reminder, when it comes to combined ratios, lower is better.
Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved from 98.3 to 95.8. And for the full year, the underlying combined ratio is 95.5, down 2.4 points from 97.9 in 2016. Jim mentioned the focus at CNA on underwriting excellence as a key lever to improving underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter and full year combined ratios demonstrate the progress being made.
Another bright spot was Loews Hotels, which posted net income of $13 million in Q4, up from $5 million last year. The joint ventures at the Universal Orlando Resort posted excellent results, as is the Loews Miami Beach, which was just completing our renovation during last year's fourth quarter. As Jim outlined during last quarter's remarks, Loews Hotels appears to be hitting its stride operationally and strategically.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was essentially flat on the quarter as were the earnings generated by the parent company investment portfolio. Corporate, which includes our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container, improved versus the prior year largely due to the timing of compensation accruals.
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. Loews reported 2017 net income of $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share, up from $654 million or $1.93 per share last year. Excluding the $200 million net benefit related to tax reform, our net income was $964 million or $2.86 per share, up $310 million from the prior year. Again, rather than walk through each segment in detail, let me highlight a few key drivers at the substantial year-over-year increase.
Lower rig impairments at Diamond Offshore accounted for $235 million of the earnings improvement. Excluding impairments, Diamond's earnings contribution declined $40 million year-over-year, reflecting the weaker operating environment and some unusual items. CNA in the aggregate accounted for $105 million of the increase, attributable mainly to improvements in noncat underwriting income and Life & Group results.
Additionally, 2016 results were impacted by adverse development related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. Net investment income and realized gains were also up over the prior year. Partially offsetting these improvements were elevated catastrophe losses in 2017 given the high incidence of natural catastrophes during the year.
Loews Hotels contributed to the net income increase, thanks to improving operating performance and a gain on the sale of a joint venture hotel property in 2017. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year. However, absent the loss Boardwalk took in 2017 on the sale of a processing facility, its net income contribution would have been up $12 million.
Parent company net investment income was flat year-over-year, and the elevated costs in corporate and other for full year 2017 are almost entirely attributable to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong liquid balance sheet. At year end, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.9 billion with 57% in cash and equivalents, 20% in healthy investments, 13% fixed maturities and 10% marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $804 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing the lion's share of that amount.
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.30 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive approximately $560 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 4.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $231 million. Since year end, we have repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for $218 million. Shares outstanding adjusted for all share repurchase activity currently stand at around 328 million.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

And I cannot think of a time in Loews' history where we have had a more talented and effective group of such individuals.
I've already mentioned Dino Robusto's supercharged performance at CNA. Needless to say, we are thrilled with his leadership and the direction in which he's taking the company. All of our CEOs are equally outstanding. Marc Edwards at Diamond continues to expertly steer the company through a protracted downturn in the offshore drilling industry, maintaining Diamond's financial stability while differentiating the company from its competition. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best CEOs in the midstream market. With his strategic vision and deep industry knowledge, Boardwalk is working to mitigate its recontracting risk while adding profitable organic growth projects. Sean Fallman, the CEO of our newest subsidiary, CCC, has demonstrated his forward-looking approach and extensive expertise in the packaging industry, and we have great expectations for his leadership of the company. And finally, we have the highest level of confidence in Jon Tisch, the CEO of Loews Hotels. Under Jon, Loews Hotels has embarked upon a new strategic direction by focusing on what we do best, group travel and immersive destinations.
While Loews is a holding company, we don't have a lot of bureaucracy. We put the right people in leadership positions at our subsidiaries and let them do their jobs. Where we have engaged with our subsidiaries are the areas where we think we can add value, such as major capital allocation decisions, accessing the capital markets and the ratification of our subsidiaries mid- to long-term strategies. This approach has served Loews shareholders very well over the past 15 years, and we expect it to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
And now back to Mary."

Related to that, you have for, I think it past 12 months or more, said that you thought the bucket, equity bucket, was too high, and therefore, you didn't want to buy back shares. The market is higher, yet you put back shares.

With respect to Loews, in fact, I mentioned specifically in my remarks that we look at the intrinsic sum of the parts value. And what that means is that we look at what we think are the values of each of our subsidiaries. We take a lot into account in doing that. We look at what the market price of the subsidiaries are. We look at what the prospects are. We try to assess whether we think the market is right or wrong in its assessment of the value of the companies. We look at the value of our nonpublic subsidiaries, hotels and CCC and the Boardwalk General Partner. And we put all that into our thinking and calculations and come out with a value that we think the whole company is worth.

We're seeing it in Asia, in Australia and also in the North Sea. And what I think is happening is that there was extensive scrapping of rigs in that space and then just a little bit of increase in demand. The demand is there, I think, because the projects that we're doing where we're seeing work are development projects where there can be a quick payback to the capital investment in the project. My strong guess is that in the coming year, we're also going to start to see a pickup in inquiry for drillships, which generally tend to do work that takes longer to generate cash returns for the oil companies. But there's no doubt that they have seriously underinvested in productive oil capacity. And I think the move-up in oil prices reflects that underinvestment in productive capacity. And my general guess is that oil will continue to move up, tempting oil companies to start to spend more on their exploration and production."

In my comments, I said that we're focusing on what we do best at Loews Hotels: group travel and immersive destinations. Kansas City is all about group travel. They're going to have an 800-room hotel atop or alongside the Kansas City Convention Center. We will be the newest hotel in Kansas City in decades, newest convention hotel, and we expect that hotel to do very well as a major regional convention center hotel. We think that the demand is built in by the location and the newness of the hotel. In Arlington, St. Louis and Orlando, that's all about immersive destinations that there are -- those are venues where we believe people will naturally gravitate, want to go to. And for all of those, we see the hotels that we're building as hotels that can cater to the people that are coming to these locations. The strategy has been proven to us many times over in Orlando and also in Miami Beach where we are able to achieve, especially in Orlando, occupancy rates and room rates that is substantially above what is available to others in the markets. And we think there is a good opportunity for that to occur in the other immersive destinations in which we're building. The problem is that you can't build a hotel overnight. It takes some time.

Before he does, however, I'd like to talk about CNA and share repurchases.
CNA has steadily improved over the past 15 years under a series of strong leadership teams. The company has taken steps to focus on its core competencies in commercial property/casualty insurance by transforming itself from a not-so-focused multi-line insurance company into a highly focused commercial property/casualty company. This transformation, obviously, didn't happen overnight, and in fact, it required enormous effort and discipline by the management teams at both CNA and Loews.
Specifically, from 1999 to 2010, CNA disposed of a number of its businesses, including reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance and group health. Additionally, the company reinsured its asbestos and pollution liabilities to reduce balance sheet risk.
Since joining the company in November of 2016 as CEO, Dino Robusto has turbocharged CNA's evolution. Under his leadership, the CNA team has been pulling a number of levers to improve underwriting performance. They have enhanced risk selection, retooled their claims department and continued to upgrade their underwriting talent. CNA has provided a stable market for agents and brokers, a factor in the company's ability to strengthen its relationships with distributors in a time of industry change. And the company has focused intently on reducing its expense ratio while also investing in the business. Dino and the team at CNA believe that there is even more room for improvement in each of these areas, and we agree.
Also, CNA continues to actively manage its long-term care book of business, mitigating risk by diligently managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when necessary. Additionally, CNA is exploring new strategies to lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders.
On the talent front, CNA added significantly to its bench in 2017 across many areas, including underwriting, technology, operations and claims. All of these new senior executives are highly successful industry veterans with outstanding track records and expertise.
Earlier today, in light of CNA's 2017 results, its fortress balance sheet and the CNA board's outlook, CNA announced a $0.30 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. In March of this year, Loews will receive $558 million in dividends from CNA. And over the last 4 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received $3.2 billion in dividends from CNA.
As we look back over the last decade, CNA's success comes as no surprise to Loews. Although we understood that it would take time and lots of hard work to turn CNA around, we had a vision for what the company could be and held steadfast to that vision. Also and very importantly, we were able to recruit the right CEO for each stage of CNA's evolution.
To sum up, we believe that the company is poised to continue to profitably and responsibly grow its business and that moving forward, CNA can and will deliver even stronger operating results.
Moving on from CNA, I want to give a quick update on share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased 4.6 million Loews shares at a cost of about $230 million. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2018 when we purchased another 4.3 million shares through February 9. With the benefit of 2020 hindsight, we could have bought more shares over the last 2 years. However, since the third quarter, we've bought back almost 9 million shares, representing almost 3% of the company. We began repurchasing our stock because of a wide discount between the stock price and our assessment of the intrinsic sum-of-the-parts valuation. Additionally, we believe that CNA will continue to grow and prosper, and that the outlook for our 4 other businesses is improving.
Looking beyond the past year or 2, in the past decade, we have acquired almost 40% of our outstanding shares, continuing our nearly half-century practice of substantial share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,550363396,1388499,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2018",2018-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net b",1171,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage in December of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The benefit, which had no cash impact, stemmed largely from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability.
Absent the $200 million benefit, our net income was $281 million or $0.83 per share, down $9 million from last year's fourth quarter. Before I discuss the drivers of fourth quarter net income, I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7 of our earnings release and Page 5 of our earnings supplement, where we show the impact of tax reform by reporting segment for the fourth quarter and full year.
Let me briefly summarize the impact by segment. CNA booked a charge in the fourth quarter as it wrote down its deferred tax asset due to the lower tax rate. In 2018 and beyond, tax reform should be quite positive for CNA. For Diamond itself, tax reform had offsetting impacts. The company benefited as it wrote down its deferred tax liability because of the lower tax rate, while it also took a charge for the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. I would note that this charge had no cash impact.
At the Loews level, however, we did book a charge in the Diamond segment, reflecting the impact of changing tax rates on the differential between our book basis and tax basis in Diamond. As a reminder, Diamond is not included in our consolidated tax return.
For Boardwalk, Loews booked a substantial benefit as the lower tax rate caused us to write down the deferred tax liability we had built up over the past decade from Boardwalk's capital projects. And for Loews Hotels, we also benefited from the lower tax rate through the write-down of a deferred tax liability.
Going forward, excluding any changes in marketplace behavior, corporate tax reform, especially the reduction in the federal corporate rate, should be positive for Loews on a consolidated basis.
Turning to the quarter. Rather than plow through each segments' year-over-year quarterly variance, let me instead highlight the key drivers of fourth quarter earnings and what caused the slight decline from Q4 2016. These highlights will exclude the previously noted impact of tax reform.
Diamond Offshore drove our slight year-to-year earnings decline with net income contribution down $74 million from Q4 2016. Contract drilling revenues were off 12% and rig margin declined substantially, largely due to fewer rigs working and lower day rates on recontracted rigs. In addition, during the quarter, the company impaired one of its rigs and booked restructuring and separation costs as it continues to aggressively manage its expense base.
On the bright side, CNA had a strong quarter to top off a strong year. Its quarterly net income contribution was up $54 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a substantial increase in underwriting income.
CNA posted a combined ratio of 94 in Q4 2017, down from 99.9 in last year's fourth quarter. As a reminder, when it comes to combined ratios, lower is better.
Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved from 98.3 to 95.8. And for the full year, the underlying combined ratio is 95.5, down 2.4 points from 97.9 in 2016. Jim mentioned the focus at CNA on underwriting excellence as a key lever to improving underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter and full year combined ratios demonstrate the progress being made.
Another bright spot was Loews Hotels, which posted net income of $13 million in Q4, up from $5 million last year. The joint ventures at the Universal Orlando Resort posted excellent results, as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was just completing our renovation during last year's fourth quarter. As Jim outlined during last quarter's remarks, Loews Hotels appears to be hitting its stride operationally and strategically.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was essentially flat on the quarter as were the earnings generated by the parent company investment portfolio. Corporate, which includes our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container, improved versus the prior year, largely due to the timing of compensation accruals.
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. Loews reported 2017 net income of $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share, up from $654 million or $1.93 per share last year. Excluding the $200 million net benefit related to tax reform, our net income was $964 million or $2.86 per share, up $310 million from the prior year. Again, rather than walk through each segment in detail, let me highlight a few key drivers of the substantial year-over-year increase.
Lower rig impairments at Diamond Offshore accounted for $235 million of the earnings improvement. Excluding impairments, Diamond's earnings contribution declined $40 million year-over-year, reflecting the weaker operating environment and some unusual items. CNA in the aggregate accounted for $105 million of the increase, attributable mainly to improvements in noncat underwriting income and Life & Group results.
Additionally, 2016 results were impacted by adverse development related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. Net investment income and realized gains were also up over the prior year. Partially offsetting these improvements were elevated catastrophe losses in 2017 given the high incidence of natural catastrophes during the year.
Loews Hotels contributed to the net income increase, thanks to improving operating performance and a gain on the sale of a joint venture hotel property in 2017. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year. However, absent the loss Boardwalk took in 2017 on the sale of a processing facility, its net income contribution would have been up $12 million.
Parent company net investment income was flat year-over-year, and the elevated costs in corporate and other for full year 2017 are almost entirely attributable to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year end, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.9 billion with 57% in cash and equivalents, 20% in LP investments, 13% fixed maturities and 10% marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $804 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing the lion's share of that amount.
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.30 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive approximately $560 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 4.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $231 million. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for $218 million. Shares outstanding, adjusted for all share repurchase activity, currently stand at around 328 million.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

And before I turn the call back to Mary, I want to reflect on the fact that one of the most important responsibilities that we have at Loews is the selection of CEOs for our underlying businesses. And I cannot think of a time in Loews' history where we have had a more talented and effective group of such individuals.
I've already mentioned Dino Robusto's supercharged performance at CNA. Needless to say, we are thrilled with his leadership and the direction in which he's taking the company. All of our CEOs are equally outstanding. Marc Edwards at Diamond continues to expertly steer the company through a protracted downturn in the offshore drilling industry, maintaining Diamond's financial stability while differentiating the company from its competition. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best CEOs in the midstream market. With his strategic vision and deep industry knowledge, Boardwalk is working to mitigate its recontracting risk while adding profitable organic growth projects. Sean Fallmann, the CEO of our newest subsidiary, CCC, has demonstrated his forward-looking approach and extensive expertise in the packaging industry, and we have great expectations for his leadership of the company. And finally, we have the highest level of confidence in Jon Tisch, the CEO of Loews Hotels. Under Jon, Loews Hotels has embarked upon a new strategic direction by focusing on what we do best: group travel and immersive destinations.
While Loews is a holding company, we don't have a lot of bureaucracy. We put the right people in leadership positions at our subsidiaries and let them do their jobs. Where we have engaged with our subsidiaries are the areas where we think we can add value, such as major capital allocation decisions, accessing the capital markets and the ratification of our subsidiaries mid- to long-term strategies. This approach has served Loews shareholders very well over the past 50 years, and we expect it to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
And now back to Mary."

The demand is there, I think, because the projects that we're doing where we're seeing work are development projects where there can be a quick payback to the capital investment in the project. My strong guess is that in the coming year, we're also going to start to see a pickup in inquiry for drillships, which generally tend to do work that takes longer to generate cash returns for the oil companies. But there's no doubt that they have seriously underinvested in productive oil capacity. And I think the move up in oil prices reflects that underinvestment in productive capacity. And my general guess is that oil will continue to move up, tempting oil companies to start to spend more on their exploration and production."

In my comments, I said that we're focusing on what we do best at Loews Hotels: group travel and immersive destinations. Kansas City is all about group travel. They're going to have an 800-room hotel atop -- or alongside the Kansas City Convention Center. We will be the newest hotel in Kansas City in decades, newest convention hotel, and we expect that hotel to do very well as a major regional convention center hotel. We think that the demand is built in by the location and the newness of the hotel. In Arlington, St. Louis and Orlando, that's all about immersive destinations, that there are -- those are venues where we believe people will naturally gravitate, want to go to. And for all of those, we see the hotels that we're building as hotels that can cater to the people that are coming to these locations. The strategy has been proven to us many times over in Orlando and also in Miami Beach, where we are able to achieve, especially in Orlando, occupancy rates and room rates that are substantially above what is available to others in the markets. And we think there is a good opportunity for that to occur in the other immersive destinations in which we're building. The problem is that you can't build a hotel overnight. It takes some time. And so these hotels won't be coming online in '18. They'll just -- some of them will just be starting up in 2019. So it will take some time to show up in the numbers."

Loews had a strong quarter and a good year with each of our subsidiaries contributing to our overall success. Our CFO, David Edelson, will go into the details about our results later in the call, as well as discussing the implications of the recently passed tax cuts for Loews and our subsidiaries. Before he does, however, I'd like to talk about CNA and share repurchases.
CNA has steadily improved over the past 15 years under a series of strong leadership teams. The company has taken steps to focus on its core competencies in commercial property/casualty insurance by transforming itself from a not-so-focused multi-line insurance company into a highly focused commercial property/casualty company. This transformation, obviously, didn't happen overnight, and in fact, it required enormous effort and discipline by the management teams at both CNA and Loews.
Specifically, from 1999 to 2010, CNA disposed of a number of its businesses, including reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance and group health. Additionally, the company reinsured its asbestos and pollution liabilities to reduce balance sheet risk.
Since joining the company in November of 2016 as CEO, Dino Robusto has turbocharged CNA's evolution. Under his leadership, the CNA team has been pulling a number of levers to improve underwriting performance. They have enhanced risk selection, retooled their claims department and continued to upgrade their underwriting talent. CNA has provided a stable market for agents and brokers, a factor in the company's ability to strengthen its relationships with distributors in a time of industry change. And the company has focused intently on reducing its expense ratio while also investing in the business. Dino and the team at CNA believe that there is even more room for improvement in each of these areas, and we agree.
Also, CNA continues to actively manage its long-term care book of business, mitigating risk by diligently managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when necessary. Additionally, CNA is exploring new strategies to lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders.
On the talent front, CNA added significantly to its bench in 2017 across many areas, including underwriting, technology, operations and claims. All of these new senior executives are highly successful industry veterans with outstanding track records and expertise.
Earlier today, in light of CNA's 2017 results, its fortress balance sheet and the CNA board's outlook, CNA announced a $0.30 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. In March of this year, Loews will receive $558 million in dividends from CNA. And over the last 4 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received $3.2 billion in dividends from CNA.
As we look back over the last decade, CNA's success comes as no surprise to Loews. Although we understood that it would take time and lots of hard work to turn CNA around, we had a vision for what the company could be and held steadfast to that vision. Also and very importantly, we were able to recruit the right CEO for each stage of CNA's evolution.
To sum up, we believe that the company is poised to continue to profitably and responsibly grow its business and that moving forward, CNA can and will deliver even stronger operating results.
Moving on from CNA, I want to give a quick update on share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased 4.6 million Loews shares at a cost of about $230 million. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2018 when we purchased another 4.3 million shares through February 9. With the benefit of 2020 hindsight, we could have bought more shares over the last 2 years. However, since the third quarter, we've bought back almost 9 million shares, representing almost 3% of the company. We began repurchasing our stock because of a wide discount between the stock price and our assessment of the intrinsic sum-of-the-parts valuation. Additionally, we believe that CNA will continue to grow and prosper, and that the outlook for our 4 other businesses is improving.
Looking beyond the past year or 2, in the past decade, we have acquired almost 40% of our outstanding shares, continuing our nearly half-century practice of substantial share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net b",1171,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage in December of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The benefit, which had no cash impact, stemmed largely from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability.
Absent the $200 million benefit, our net income was $281 million or $0.83 per share, down $9 million from last year's fourth quarter. Before I discuss the drivers of fourth quarter net income, I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7 of our earnings release and Page 5 of our earnings supplement, where we show the impact of tax reform by reporting segment for the fourth quarter and full year.
Let me briefly summarize the impact by segment. CNA booked a charge in the fourth quarter as it wrote down its deferred tax asset due to the lower tax rate. In 2018 and beyond, tax reform should be quite positive for CNA. For Diamond itself, tax reform had offsetting impacts. The company benefited as it wrote down its deferred tax liability because of the lower tax rate, while it also took a charge for the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. I would note that this charge had no cash impact.
At the Loews level, however, we did book a charge in the Diamond segment, reflecting the impact of changing tax rates on the differential between our book basis and tax basis in Diamond. As a reminder, Diamond is not included in our consolidated tax return.
For Boardwalk, Loews booked a substantial benefit as the lower tax rate caused us to write down the deferred tax liability we had built up over the past decade from Boardwalk's capital projects. And for Loews Hotels, we also benefited from the lower tax rate through the write-down of a deferred tax liability.
Going forward, excluding any changes in marketplace behavior, corporate tax reform, especially the reduction in the federal corporate rate, should be positive for Loews on a consolidated basis.
Turning to the quarter. Rather than plow through each segments' year-over-year quarterly variance, let me instead highlight the key drivers of fourth quarter earnings and what caused the slight decline from Q4 2016. These highlights will exclude the previously noted impact of tax reform.
Diamond Offshore drove our slight year-to-year earnings decline with net income contribution down $74 million from Q4 2016. Contract drilling revenues were off 12% and rig margin declined substantially, largely due to fewer rigs working and lower day rates on recontracted rigs. In addition, during the quarter, the company impaired one of its rigs and booked restructuring and separation costs as it continues to aggressively manage its expense base.
On the bright side, CNA had a strong quarter to top off a strong year. Its quarterly net income contribution was up $54 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a substantial increase in underwriting income.
CNA posted a combined ratio of 94 in Q4 2017, down from 99.9 in last year's fourth quarter. As a reminder, when it comes to combined ratios, lower is better.
Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved from 98.3 to 95.8. And for the full year, the underlying combined ratio is 95.5, down 2.4 points from 97.9 in 2016. Jim mentioned the focus at CNA on underwriting excellence as a key lever to improving underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter and full year combined ratios demonstrate the progress being made.
Another bright spot was Loews Hotels, which posted net income of $13 million in Q4, up from $5 million last year. The joint ventures at the Universal Orlando Resort posted excellent results, as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was just completing our renovation during last year's fourth quarter. As Jim outlined during last quarter's remarks, Loews Hotels appears to be hitting its stride operationally and strategically.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was essentially flat on the quarter as were the earnings generated by the parent company investment portfolio. Corporate, which includes our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container, improved versus the prior year, largely due to the timing of compensation accruals.
Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. Loews reported 2017 net income of $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share, up from $654 million or $1.93 per share last year. Excluding the $200 million net benefit related to tax reform, our net income was $964 million or $2.86 per share, up $310 million from the prior year. Again, rather than walk through each segment in detail, let me highlight a few key drivers of the substantial year-over-year increase.
Lower rig impairments at Diamond Offshore accounted for $235 million of the earnings improvement. Excluding impairments, Diamond's earnings contribution declined $40 million year-over-year, reflecting the weaker operating environment and some unusual items. CNA in the aggregate accounted for $105 million of the increase, attributable mainly to improvements in noncat underwriting income and Life & Group results.
Additionally, 2016 results were impacted by adverse development related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. Net investment income and realized gains were also up over the prior year. Partially offsetting these improvements were elevated catastrophe losses in 2017 given the high incidence of natural catastrophes during the year.
Loews Hotels contributed to the net income increase, thanks to improving operating performance and a gain on the sale of a joint venture hotel property in 2017. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year. However, absent the loss Boardwalk took in 2017 on the sale of a processing facility, its net income contribution would have been up $12 million.
Parent company net investment income was flat year-over-year, and the elevated costs in corporate and other for full year 2017 are almost entirely attributable to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year end, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.9 billion with 57% in cash and equivalents, 20% in LP investments, 13% fixed maturities and 10% marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $804 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing the lion's share of that amount.
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.30 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive approximately $560 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 4.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $231 million. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for $218 million. Shares outstanding, adjusted for all share repurchase activity, currently stand at around 328 million.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

And I cannot think of a time in Loews' history where we have had a more talented and effective group of such individuals.
I've already mentioned Dino Robusto's supercharged performance at CNA. Needless to say, we are thrilled with his leadership and the direction in which he's taking the company. All of our CEOs are equally outstanding. Marc Edwards at Diamond continues to expertly steer the company through a protracted downturn in the offshore drilling industry, maintaining Diamond's financial stability while differentiating the company from its competition. Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best CEOs in the midstream market. With his strategic vision and deep industry knowledge, Boardwalk is working to mitigate its recontracting risk while adding profitable organic growth projects. Sean Fallmann, the CEO of our newest subsidiary, CCC, has demonstrated his forward-looking approach and extensive expertise in the packaging industry, and we have great expectations for his leadership of the company. And finally, we have the highest level of confidence in Jon Tisch, the CEO of Loews Hotels. Under Jon, Loews Hotels has embarked upon a new strategic direction by focusing on what we do best: group travel and immersive destinations.
While Loews is a holding company, we don't have a lot of bureaucracy. We put the right people in leadership positions at our subsidiaries and let them do their jobs. Where we have engaged with our subsidiaries are the areas where we think we can add value, such as major capital allocation decisions, accessing the capital markets and the ratification of our subsidiaries mid- to long-term strategies. This approach has served Loews shareholders very well over the past 50 years, and we expect it to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
And now back to Mary."

We're seeing it in Asia, in Australia and also in the North Sea. And what I think is happening is that there was extensive scrapping of rigs in that space and then just a little bit of increase in demand. The demand is there, I think, because the projects that we're doing where we're seeing work are development projects where there can be a quick payback to the capital investment in the project. My strong guess is that in the coming year, we're also going to start to see a pickup in inquiry for drillships, which generally tend to do work that takes longer to generate cash returns for the oil companies. But there's no doubt that they have seriously underinvested in productive oil capacity. And I think the move up in oil prices reflects that underinvestment in productive capacity. And my general guess is that oil will continue to move up, tempting oil companies to start to spend more on their exploration and production."

In my comments, I said that we're focusing on what we do best at Loews Hotels: group travel and immersive destinations. Kansas City is all about group travel. They're going to have an 800-room hotel atop -- or alongside the Kansas City Convention Center. We will be the newest hotel in Kansas City in decades, newest convention hotel, and we expect that hotel to do very well as a major regional convention center hotel. We think that the demand is built in by the location and the newness of the hotel. In Arlington, St. Louis and Orlando, that's all about immersive destinations, that there are -- those are venues where we believe people will naturally gravitate, want to go to. And for all of those, we see the hotels that we're building as hotels that can cater to the people that are coming to these locations. The strategy has been proven to us many times over in Orlando and also in Miami Beach, where we are able to achieve, especially in Orlando, occupancy rates and room rates that are substantially above what is available to others in the markets. And we think there is a good opportunity for that to occur in the other immersive destinations in which we're building. The problem is that you can't build a hotel overnight. It takes some time. And so these hotels won't be coming online in '18. They'll just -- some of them will just be starting up in 2019. So it will take some time to show up in the numbers."

Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listen to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. The Federal Energy Regulatory Co",756,"Thank you, Mary. Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listen to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a policy change that eliminates an MLP's ability to include an income tax allowance in determining the maximum applicable rates it is allowed to charge customers on its interest rate pipelines. The recent tax reform legislation, coupled with FERC's subsequent actions, have sparked the review as to whether Boardwalk should remain a publicly-traded master limited partnership. It appears that FERC's action would materially decrease the maximum applicable rates Boardwalk could charge in the future. 
The effect on max rates may result in Loews being able to exercise or call right under the terms of the Boardwalk partnership agreement. Those terms allow Loews to purchase Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price. The formula price would be based on the average of the daily closing prices of Boardwalk's common units for a 180-day period prior to the day when and if we exercise our purchase right. This purchase right is further described both in our 10-Q and Boardwalk's 10-Q as well as in Boardwalk's past SEC filings. It is also discussed in Lowe's amended Form [indiscernible], which will be filed later today. 
We at Loews are exploring all our options regarding these developments. Although we expect to be able to make a decision sometime this year, no decisions have yet been made. As you can imagine, we'll have to let our documents speak for themselves since we are constrained from answering any questions on this topic. 
Luckily, we have other subsidiaries in capital allocation actions that we can discuss. In particular, the earnings for CNA and Loews Hotels have been impressive. So I'd like to give you some color on what's happening in each of these companies. 
CNA had another phenomenal quarter, delivering a combined ratio of 93.1%, the lowest quarterly underlying combined ratio it had in over a decade. While the recent tax cuts contributed to its quarterly performance, CNA's substantial earnings increase was primarily due to the strength of its underwriting results. 
For the quarter, CNA had a pretax underwriting gain of $113 million versus $43 million in the corresponding quarter last year, and adjusted net written premium likewise grew 8%. The company's growth was driven by rate, exposure change and a strong increase in new business as CNA continues to make great strides with its distribution network. 
While pleased with the strong results, CNA remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors and diligently managing its expense ratio. Loews and CNA both feel that the company is poised for ongoing responsible growth. 
And speaking of ongoing responsible growth, Loews Hotels also had a terrific quarter and is off to a great start for the year. A stronger-than-usual tourism market in Florida benefited our recently renovated Loews Miami Beach Hotel. 
Additionally, in Orlando, our joint venture properties with Universal Studios continued to perform remarkably well. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA was up 30% from last year's first quarter, and this growth was not based solely on the hotel change expansion but also on the strong performance of its existing properties. 
Same-store RevPAR also grew 8% from $188 in last year's first quarter to $203 during the first quarter of 2018. 
Loews Hotels continues to concentrate on a highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market that catered to group business. The company also seeks out properties that have partners who bring with them unique built-in demand generator as it has done so successfully in its long-term partnership at the Universal Orlando resort. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willingness and ability to invest in its own projects all represent competitive advantages. 
We're confident in this strategy and Loews Hotels' leadership and in the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk about share repurchases. Over the past 7 months, Loews has repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares or about 5.5% of our outstanding shares at a cost -- at a total cost of almost $1 billion. These buybacks reflect our confidence in our underlying businesses. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation levers for creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
David, over to you."
285930,558882257,1442295,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2018",2018-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, result",1018,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. 
For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, resulting in higher earnings per share despite a slight reduction in net income. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. I will start with CNA, which contributed almost 90% of our net income this quarter and accounted for the biggest year-over-year positive earnings variance. 
CNA contributed net income of [ $261 ] million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017. There were 2 main drivers of the increase, improved underwriting income and higher after-tax investment income. 
CNA posted outstanding P&C underwriting results in the quarter. This strength was broad-based and spanned all 3 P&C segments, commercial, specialty and international. 
While CNA once again experienced favorable prior year development, its underwriting results in Q1, 2018 were robust even before prior year development and catastrophe losses. 
During the first quarter, CNA's P&C combined ratio was 93.1 and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior year development and catastrophe losses, was almost as identical at 93.2. Both represented over 4 points of improvement versus last year's first quarter. 
Let me highlight CNA's loss ratio, which is a component of its combined ratio. CNA posted an underlying loss ratio of [ 60 ] in Q1, an improvement of more than 2 points from last year's first quarter and 1 point better than full year 2017. CNA's loss ratio shows real improvement and compares favorably to peers. 
The meaningful decline in CNA's combined ratio led to a significant increase in the company's P&C underwriting income, which climbed more than [ 160% ] pretax and even more after-tax given the lower corporate tax rate. 
Net investment income was lower year-over-year on a pretax basis due entirely to LP income, but the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in an increase in after-tax net investment income. 
Despite the year-over-year decline in LP income, CNA's LP portfolio returned a respectable 1.2% in a quarter during which the S&P 500 returned negative 1.2%. 
Before leaving CNA, I will note that CNA completed its review of its asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the first quarter and booked a noneconomic retroactive reinsurance charge related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. This charge, which is essentially a deferred gain, reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $28 million this year and by $12 million last year. 
Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore made a $10 million positive contribution to our net income in the first quarter despite a $25 million pretax loss. The pretax loss was an outgrowth of the continuing difficult conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues caused by a similar decline in revenue earning days. 
The swing from a pretax loss to positive net income was caused by a tax benefit as Diamond reversed an uncertain tax position it had booked in Q4 2017 related to the [indiscernible] repatriation of previously deferred non-U.S. earnings. 
Further guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS in the first quarter clarified certain provisions in the Tax Act, permitting Diamond to reverse its liability for this uncertain tax position. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year despite a decline in pretax income. The reduction in pretax income was precipitated by a 5% decline in net revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects recently placed into service and the benefits of colder weather did not make up for the near-term negative revenue impact of the previously announced restructuring of existing firm transportation agreements with Southwestern Energy as well as a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues caused by unfavorable market conditions. 
The lower corporate tax rate booked at the Loews level resulted in Boardwalk's after-tax earnings being almost flat with the prior year. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels. As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels posted excellent results in Q1 as many of its properties, including Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, posted strong operational and financial results. 
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, up from $10 million in Q1 2017. The quarterly comparison looks even better once last year's results are adjusted to the $10 million pretax, $6 million after-tax, net gain attributable to the sale of a JV property and the writedown of another JV property. 
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary available on our IR website, was $57 million in the quarter, up $13 million from last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax and after-tax investment income were down from an exceptionally strong quarter in Q1 2017, with lower returns on equities and LP investments driving the year-to-year decline. The bulk of the portfolio continues to be invested in cash and equivalents. 
The corporate and other segment improved $10 million on the pretax basis for 2 main reasons: the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 in connection with the acquisition of consolidated container and income generated by consolidated container in the first quarter of 2018. 
The parent company balance sheet continues to be extremely strong and liquid. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled just under $4.9 billion was slightly more than 50% in cash and short-term investments, and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and the diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. We received $571 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $558 million from CNA, which includes the $0.30 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
We repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $497 million. After quarter end, we've purchased an additional 4 million-plus shares for a total of $207 million. Taken together, we have repurchased over 4% of our shares outstanding since year-end 2017. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listened to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. The Federal Energy Regulatory",755,"Thank you, Mary. Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listened to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a policy change that eliminates an MLP's ability to include an income tax allowance in determining the maximum applicable rates it is allowed to charge customers on its interstate pipelines. The recent tax reform legislation, coupled with FERC's subsequent actions, have sparked a review as to whether Boardwalk should remain a publicly traded master limited partnership. It appears that FERC's action would materially decrease the maximum applicable rates Boardwalk could charge in the future. 
The effect on max rates may result in Loews being able to exercise or call right under the terms of the Boardwalk partnership agreement. Those terms allow Loews to purchase Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price. The formula price would be based on the average of the daily closing prices of Boardwalk's common units for a 180-day period prior to the day when and if we exercise our purchase right. 
This purchase right is further described both in our 10-Q and Boardwalk's 10-Q as well as in Boardwalk's past SEC filings. It is also discussed in Lowe's amended Form 13D, which will be filed later today.
We, at Loews, are exploring all our options regarding these developments. Although we expect to be able to make a decision sometime this year, no decisions have yet been made. As you can imagine, we'll have to let our documents speak for themselves since we are constrained from answering any questions on this topic. 
Luckily, we have other subsidiaries and capital allocation actions that we can discuss. In particular, the earnings for CNA and Loews Hotels have been impressive, so I'd like to give you some color on what's happening in each of these companies. 
CNA had another phenomenal quarter, delivering a combined ratio of 93.1%, the lowest quarterly underlying combined ratio it had in over a decade. While the recent tax cuts contributed to its quarterly performance, CNA's substantial earnings increase was primarily due to the strength of its underwriting results. 
For the quarter, CNA had a pretax underwriting gain of $113 million versus $43 million in the corresponding quarter last year, and adjusted net written premium likewise grew 8%. The company's growth was driven by rate, exposure change and a strong increase in new business as CNA continues to make great strides with its distribution network. 
While pleased with the strong results, CNA remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors and diligently managing its expense ratio. Loews and CNA both feel that the company is poised for ongoing responsible growth. 
And speaking of ongoing responsible growth, Loews Hotels also had a terrific quarter and is off to a great start for the year. A stronger-than-usual tourism market in Florida benefited our recently renovated Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Additionally, in Orlando, our joint venture properties with Universal Studios continued to perform remarkably well. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA was up 30% from last year's first quarter, and this growth was not based solely on the hotel change expansion but also on the strong performance of its existing properties. 
Same-store RevPAR also grew 8% from $188 in last year's first quarter to $203 during the first quarter of 2018. 
Loews Hotels continues to concentrate on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market that cater to group business. The company also seeks out properties that have partners who bring with them unique built-in demand generators as it has done so successfully in its long-term partnership at the Universal Orlando resort. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willingness and ability to invest in its own projects all represent competitive advantages. We're confident in this strategy and Loews Hotels' leadership and in the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk about share repurchases. Over the past 7 months, Loews has repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares or about 5.5% of our outstanding shares at a cost -- at a total cost of almost $1 billion. These buybacks reflect our confidence in our underlying businesses. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation levers for creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
David, over to you."
285930,558882257,1442361,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2018",2018-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, result",1013,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. 
For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, resulting in higher earnings per share despite a slight reduction in net income. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. I will start with CNA, which contributed almost 90% of our net income this quarter and accounted for the biggest year-over-year positive earnings variance. CNA contributed net income of $261 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017. There were 2 main drivers of the increase: improved underwriting income and higher after-tax investment income. 
CNA posted outstanding P&C underwriting results in the quarter. This strength was broad based and spanned all 3 P&C segments, commercial, specialty and international. 
While CNA once again experienced favorable prior year development, its underwriting results in Q1 2018 were robust even before prior year development and catastrophe losses. 
During the first quarter, CNA's P&C combined ratio was 93.1 and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior year development and catastrophe losses, was almost as identical at 93.2. Both represented over 4 points of improvement versus last year's first quarter. 
Let me highlight CNA's loss ratio, which is a component of its combined ratio. CNA posted an underlying loss ratio of 60 in Q1, an improvement of more than 2 points from last year's first quarter and 1 point better than full year 2017. CNA's loss ratio shows real improvement and compares favorably to peers. 
The meaningful decline in CNA's combined ratio led to a significant increase in the company's P&C underwriting income, which climbed more than 160% pretax and even more after-tax given the lower corporate tax rate. 
Net investment income was lower year-over-year on a pretax basis due entirely to LP income, but the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in an increase in after-tax net investment income. 
Despite the year-over-year decline in LP income, CNA's LP portfolio returned a respectable 1.2% in a quarter during which the S&P 500 returned negative 1.2%. 
Before leaving CNA, I will note that CNA completed its review of its asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the first quarter and booked a noneconomic retroactive reinsurance charge related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. This charge, which is essentially a deferred gain, reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $28 million this year and by $12 million last year. 
Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore made a $10 million positive contribution to our net income in the first quarter despite a $25 million pretax loss. The pretax loss was an outgrowth of the continuing difficult conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues caused by a similar decline in revenue earning days. 
The swing from a pretax loss to positive net income was caused by a tax benefit as Diamond reversed an uncertain tax position it had booked in Q4 2017 related to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred non-U.S. earnings. Further guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS in the first quarter clarified certain provisions in the Tax Act, permitting Diamond to reverse its liability for this uncertain tax position. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year despite a decline in pretax income. The reduction in pretax income was precipitated by a 5% decline in net revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects recently placed into service and the benefits of colder weather did not make up for the near-term negative revenue impact of the previously announced restructuring of existing firm transportation agreements with Southwestern Energy as well as a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues caused by unfavorable market conditions. 
The lower corporate tax rate booked at the Loews level resulted in Boardwalk's after-tax earnings being almost flat with the prior year. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels. As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels posted excellent results in Q1 as many of its properties, including Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, posted strong operational and financial results. 
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, up from $10 million in Q1 2017. The quarterly comparison looks even better once last year's results are adjusted for the $10 million pretax, $6 million after-tax net gain attributable to the sale of a JV property and the write-down of another JV property. 
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary available on our IR website, was $57 million in the quarter, up $13 million from last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax and after-tax investment income were down from an exceptionally strong quarter in Q1 2017 with lower returns on equities and LP investments driving the year-to-year decline. The bulk of the portfolio continues to be invested in cash and equivalents. 
The Corporate and other segment improved $10 million on a pretax basis for 2 main reasons: the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container and income generated by Consolidated Container in the first quarter of 2018. 
The parent company balance sheet continues to be extremely strong and liquid. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled just under $4.9 billion, was slightly more than 50% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. We received $571 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter; $558 million from CNA, which includes the $0.30 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
We repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $497 million. After quarter end, we've purchased an additional 4-plus million shares for a total of $207 million. Taken together, we have repurchased over 4% of our shares outstanding since year-end 2017. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listened to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a policy change that eliminates an MLP's ability to include an income tax allowance in determining the maximum applicable rates it is allowed to charge customers on its interstate pipelines. The recent tax reform legislation, coupled with FERC's subsequent actions, have sparked a review as to whether Boardwalk should remain a publicly traded master limited partnership. It appears that FERC's action would materially decrease the maximum applicable rates Boardwalk could charge in the future. 
The effect on max rates may result in Loews being able to exercise a call right under the terms of the Boardwalk partnership agreement. Those terms allow Loews to purchase Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price. The formula price would be based on the average of the daily closing prices of Boardwalk's common units for a 180-day period prior to the day when and if we exercise our purchase right. 
This purchase right is further described both in our 10-Q and Boardwalk's 10-Q as well as in Boardwalk's past SEC filings. It is also discussed in Loews' amended Form 13D, which will be filed later today.
We at Loews are exploring all our options regarding these developments. Although we expect to be able to make a decision sometime this year, no decisions have yet been made. As you can imagine, we'll have to let our documents speak for themselves since we are constrained from answering any questions on this topic. 
Luckily, we have other subsidiaries and capital allocation actions that we can discuss. In particular, the earnings for CNA and Loews Hotels have been impressive, so I'd like to give you some color on what's happening in each of these companies. 
CNA had another phenomenal quarter, delivering a combined ratio of 93.1%, the lowest quarterly underlying combined ratio it's had in over a decade. While the recent tax cuts contributed to its quarterly performance, CNA's substantial earnings increase was primarily due to the strength of its underwriting results. 
For the quarter, CNA had a pretax underwriting gain of $113 million versus $43 million in the corresponding quarter last year, and adjusted net written premium likewise grew 8%. The company's growth was driven by rate, exposure change and a strong increase in new business as CNA continues to make great strides with its distribution network. 
While pleased with the strong results, CNA remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors and diligently managing its expense ratio. Loews and CNA both feel that the company is poised for ongoing responsible growth. 
And speaking of ongoing responsible growth, Loews Hotels also had a terrific quarter and is off to a great start for the year. A stronger-than-usual tourism market in Florida benefited our recently renovated Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Additionally, in Orlando, our joint venture properties with Universal Studios continued to perform remarkably well. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA was up 30% from last year's first quarter, and this growth was not based solely on the hotel change expansion but also on the strong performance of its existing properties. 
Same-store RevPAR also grew 8% from $188 in last year's first quarter to $203 during the first quarter of 2018. 
Loews Hotels continues to concentrate on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market that cater to group business. The company also seeks out properties that have partners who bring with them unique built-in demand generators as it has done so successfully in its long-term partnership at the Universal Orlando resort. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willingness and ability to invest in its own projects all represent competitive advantages. We're confident in this strategy and Loews Hotels' leadership and in the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk about share repurchases. Over the past 7 months, Loews has repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares or about 5.5% of our outstanding shares at a cost -- at a total cost of almost $1 billion. These buybacks reflect our confidence in our underlying businesses. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation levers for creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
David, over to you."
285930,558882257,1442437,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2018",2018-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, result",1012,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. 
For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, resulting in higher earnings per share despite a slight reduction in net income. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. I will start with CNA, which contributed almost 90% of our net income this quarter and accounted for the biggest year-over-year positive earnings variance. CNA contributed net income of $261 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017. There were 2 main drivers of the increase: improved underwriting income and higher after-tax investment income. 
CNA posted outstanding P&C underwriting results in the quarter. This strength was broad-based and spanned all 3 P&C segments: commercial, specialty and international. 
While CNA once again experienced favorable prior year development, its underwriting results in Q1 2018 were robust even before prior year development and catastrophe losses. 
During the first quarter, CNA's P&C combined ratio was 93.1 and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior year development and catastrophe losses, was almost as identical at 93.2. Both represented over 4 points of improvement versus last year's first quarter. 
Let me highlight CNA's loss ratio, which is a component of its combined ratio. CNA posted an underlying loss ratio of 60 in Q1, an improvement of more than 2 points from last year's first quarter and 1 point better than full year 2017. CNA's loss ratio shows real improvement and compares favorably to peers. 
The meaningful decline in CNA's combined ratio led to a significant increase in the company's P&C underwriting income, which climbed more than 160% pretax and even more after-tax given the lower corporate tax rate. 
Net investment income was lower year-over-year on a pretax basis due entirely to LP income, but the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in an increase in after-tax net investment income. 
Despite the year-over-year decline in LP income, CNA's LP portfolio returned a respectable 1.2% in a quarter during which the S&P 500 returned negative 1.2%. 
Before leaving CNA, I will note that CNA completed its review of its asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the first quarter and booked a noneconomic retroactive reinsurance charge related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. This charge, which is essentially a deferred gain, reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $28 million this year and by $12 million last year. 
Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore made a $10 million positive contribution to our net income in the first quarter despite a $25 million pretax loss. The pretax loss was an outgrowth of the continuing difficult conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues caused by a similar decline in revenue earning days. 
The swing from a pretax loss to positive net income was caused by a tax benefit as Diamond reversed an uncertain tax position it had booked in Q4 2017 related to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred non-U.S. earnings. Further guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS in the first quarter clarified certain provisions in the Tax Act, permitting Diamond to reverse its liability for this uncertain tax position. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year despite a decline in pretax income. The reduction in pretax income was precipitated by a 5% decline in net revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects recently placed into service and the benefits of colder weather did not make up for the near-term negative revenue impact of the previously announced restructuring of existing firm transportation agreements with Southwestern Energy as well as a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues caused by unfavorable market conditions. 
The lower corporate tax rate booked at the Loews level resulted in Boardwalk's after-tax earnings being almost flat with the prior year. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels. As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels posted excellent results in Q1 as many of its properties, including Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, posted strong operational and financial results. 
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, up from $10 million in Q1 2017. The quarterly comparison looks even better once last year's results are adjusted for the $10 million pretax, $6 million after-tax net gain attributable to the sale of a JV property and the write-down of another JV property. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary available on our IR website, was $57 million in the quarter, up $13 million from last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax and after-tax investment income were down from an exceptionally strong quarter in Q1 2017 with lower returns on equities and LP investments driving the year-to-year decline. The bulk of the portfolio continues to be invested in cash and equivalents. 
The Corporate and other segment improved $10 million on a pretax basis for 2 main reasons: the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container and income generated by Consolidated Container in the first quarter of 2018. 
The parent company balance sheet continues to be extremely strong and liquid. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled just under $4.9 billion, was slightly more than 50% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. We received $571 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter; $558 million from CNA, which includes the $0.30 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
We repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $497 million. After quarter end, we've purchased an additional 4-plus million shares for a total of $207 million. Taken together, we have repurchased over 4% of our shares outstanding since year-end 2017. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

The Federal Energy Regulatory",755,"Thank you, Mary. Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listened to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a policy change that eliminates an MLP's ability to include an income tax allowance in determining the maximum applicable rates it is allowed to charge customers on its interstate pipelines. The recent tax reform legislation, coupled with FERC's subsequent actions, have sparked a review as to whether Boardwalk should remain a publicly traded master limited partnership. It appears that FERC's action would materially decrease the maximum applicable rates Boardwalk could charge in the future. 
The effect on max rates may result in Loews being able to exercise a call right under the terms of the Boardwalk partnership agreement. Those terms allow Loews to purchase Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price. The formula price would be based on the average of the daily closing prices of Boardwalk's common units for a 180-day period prior to the day when and if we exercise our purchase right. 
This purchase right is further described both in our 10-Q and Boardwalk's 10-Q as well as in Boardwalk's past SEC filings. It is also discussed in Loews' amended Form 13D, which will be filed later today.
We at Loews are exploring all our options regarding these developments. Although we expect to be able to make a decision sometime this year, no decisions have yet been made. As you can imagine, we'll have to let our documents speak for themselves since we are constrained from answering any questions on this topic. 
Luckily, we have other subsidiaries and capital allocation actions that we can discuss. In particular, the earnings for CNA and Loews Hotels have been impressive, so I'd like to give you some color on what's happening in each of these companies. 
CNA had another phenomenal quarter, delivering a combined ratio of 93.1%, the lowest quarterly underlying combined ratio it's had in over a decade. While the recent tax cuts contributed to its quarterly performance, CNA's substantial earnings increase was primarily due to the strength of its underwriting results. 
For the quarter, CNA had a pretax underwriting gain of $113 million versus $43 million in the corresponding quarter last year, and adjusted net written premium likewise grew 8%. The company's growth was driven by rate, exposure change and a strong increase in new business as CNA continues to make great strides with its distribution network. 
While pleased with the strong results, CNA remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors and diligently managing its expense ratio. Loews and CNA both feel that the company is poised for ongoing responsible growth. 
And speaking of ongoing responsible growth, Loews Hotels also had a terrific quarter and is off to a great start for the year. A stronger-than-usual tourism market in Florida benefited our recently renovated Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Additionally, in Orlando, our joint venture properties with Universal Studios continued to perform remarkably well. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA was up 30% from last year's first quarter, and this growth was not based solely on the hotel change expansion but also on the strong performance of its existing properties. 
Same-store RevPAR also grew 8% from $188 in last year's first quarter to $203 during the first quarter of 2018. 
Loews Hotels continues to concentrate on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market that cater to group business. The company also seeks out properties that have partners who bring with them unique built-in demand generators as it has done so successfully in its long-term partnership at the Universal Orlando resort. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willingness and ability to invest in its own projects all represent competitive advantages. We're confident in this strategy and Loews Hotels' leadership and in the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk about share repurchases. Over the past 7 months, Loews has repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares or about 5.5% of our outstanding shares at a cost -- at a total cost of almost $1 billion. These buybacks reflect our confidence in our underlying businesses. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation levers for creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
David, over to you."
285930,558882257,1444278,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2018",2018-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, result",1012,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. 
For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, resulting in higher earnings per share despite a slight reduction in net income. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. I will start with CNA, which contributed almost 90% of our net income this quarter and accounted for the biggest year-over-year positive earnings variance. CNA contributed net income of $261 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017. There were 2 main drivers of the increase: improved underwriting income and higher after-tax investment income. 
CNA posted outstanding P&C underwriting results in the quarter. This strength was broad-based and spanned all 3 P&C segments: commercial, specialty and international. 
While CNA once again experienced favorable prior year development, its underwriting results in Q1 2018 were robust even before prior year development and catastrophe losses. 
During the first quarter, CNA's P&C combined ratio was 93.1 and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior year development and catastrophe losses, was almost as identical at 93.2. Both represented over 4 points of improvement versus last year's first quarter. 
Let me highlight CNA's loss ratio, which is a component of its combined ratio. CNA posted an underlying loss ratio of 60 in Q1, an improvement of more than 2 points from last year's first quarter and 1 point better than full year 2017. CNA's loss ratio shows real improvement and compares favorably to peers. 
The meaningful decline in CNA's combined ratio led to a significant increase in the company's P&C underwriting income, which climbed more than 160% pretax and even more after-tax given the lower corporate tax rate. 
Net investment income was lower year-over-year on a pretax basis due entirely to LP income, but the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in an increase in after-tax net investment income. 
Despite the year-over-year decline in LP income, CNA's LP portfolio returned a respectable 1.2% in a quarter during which the S&P 500 returned negative 1.2%. 
Before leaving CNA, I will note that CNA completed its review of its asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the first quarter and booked a noneconomic retroactive reinsurance charge related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. This charge, which is essentially a deferred gain, reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $28 million this year and by $12 million last year. 
Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore made a $10 million positive contribution to our net income in the first quarter despite a $25 million pretax loss. The pretax loss was an outgrowth of the continuing difficult conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues caused by a similar decline in revenue earning days. 
The swing from a pretax loss to positive net income was caused by a tax benefit as Diamond reversed an uncertain tax position it had booked in Q4 2017 related to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred non-U.S. earnings. Further guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS in the first quarter clarified certain provisions in the Tax Act, permitting Diamond to reverse its liability for this uncertain tax position. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year despite a decline in pretax income. The reduction in pretax income was precipitated by a 5% decline in net revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects recently placed into service and the benefits of colder weather did not make up for the near-term negative revenue impact of the previously announced restructuring of existing firm transportation agreements with Southwestern Energy as well as a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues caused by unfavorable market conditions. 
The lower corporate tax rate booked at the Loews level resulted in Boardwalk's after-tax earnings being almost flat with the prior year. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels. As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels posted excellent results in Q1 as many of its properties, including Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, posted strong operational and financial results. 
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, up from $10 million in Q1 2017. The quarterly comparison looks even better once last year's results are adjusted for the $10 million pretax, $6 million after-tax net gain attributable to the sale of a JV property and the write-down of another JV property. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary available on our IR website, was $57 million in the quarter, up $13 million from last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax and after-tax investment income were down from an exceptionally strong quarter in Q1 2017 with lower returns on equities and LP investments driving the year-to-year decline. The bulk of the portfolio continues to be invested in cash and equivalents. 
The Corporate and other segment improved $10 million on a pretax basis for 2 main reasons: the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container and income generated by Consolidated Container in the first quarter of 2018. 
The parent company balance sheet continues to be extremely strong and liquid. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled just under $4.9 billion, was slightly more than 50% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. We received $571 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter; $558 million from CNA, which includes the $0.30 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
We repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $497 million. After quarter end, we've purchased an additional 4-plus million shares for a total of $207 million. Taken together, we have repurchased over 4% of our shares outstanding since year-end 2017. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

285930,573549432,1513407,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulato",1157,"Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, we began to rethink the efficacy and wisdom for the MLP structure to Boardwalk's. After careful consideration of all options, we determined that exercising our call provision was in the best interest of Loews shareholders. 
On June 29, we announced that we would redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price of $12.06 per share for a total cost to Loews of slightly over $1.5 billion. The transaction closed in July. We were able to execute this transaction by camping -- tapping the ample liquidity in the Loews Corporate Treasury. I'll be talking more about Boardwalk on future calls. 
Now on to other Loews business. Loews had a strong second quarter, positively impacted once again by consistent earnings through CNA. Premium growth for CNA remains strong and the company saw positive great trends in the second quarter. Additionally, the underlying loss ratio improved in the first half of the year from an already strong base. 
Earlier this morning, CNA announced a 17% increase in its regular dividend, reporting CNA's strong operating results and outline. And while around the subject of CNA, but also I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Craig Mincey, who is retiring after serving as the CNA Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. The company's fortress balance sheet today is due in large part to Craig's extraordinary focus an outstanding fiscal management. Craig, if you are listening, we have Loews thank you for your tremendous service and wish you a wonderful retirement.
Next, I'd like to do a 1-year checking on our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company or CCC. Loews acquired CCC and the transaction closed in May of last year, and I'm happy to report that the business is performing well. In 2018, we expect CCC to produce double digits cash-on-cash return on our equity investment. For anyone who name is quick review, CCC is the leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company makes containers for stable end markets, such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. With the acquisition of CCC, Loews added a new industry to its already diverse portfolio of businesses as well as another platform for growth.
When we acquired CCC a year ago, we talked about our desire to grow the business, and the CCC team has started that process by making 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company has bid on more sizable oppositions only to find out for the bigger companies, the prices have been too high. CCC is happy to be patient while continuing to look for additional acquisition targets. We hope to have more to report in this area in the quarters ahead.
Another reason we were attracted to CCC were the strong and experienced management team as well as its track record of operational excellence. Happily, time is only added to our positive opinion as CCC senior leadership team. Over the last year, CEO Sean Pohlman and his team have focused on creating greater efficiencies and streamlining production processes to obtain better margins. 
Additionally, CCC's price increase emphasis on their innovative, juror wide technology, a patented design that utilizes less resin while creating beverage packaging of higher strength and improved company -- customer ergonomics. For CCC, the dura wide technology has had to increased unit volume and has enhanced relationship with customers. Durawide is better for CCC's customers who are now spending less on packaging materials and better for the environment as well.
And while we're on the subject of the environment, there's been a lot of discussion in the news recently about plastics and their effect on our planet. This is an extremely important issue and one that both Loews and CCC take seriously. 
Today, I want to talk about 2 aspects of plastics in the environment, single-use plastics such as straw, disposable, [indiscernible] and plastic waste, and plastic waste that pollutes the world's ocean. First, I'd like to emphasize that CCC is not in the business of producing single-use plastic items. It's focus is on producing primary packaging designed to protect and extend the shelf life of the contents inside. Of all the packaging that CCC produces, 97% is truly recyclable. In addition to manufacturing packaging, CCC is also the second largest U.S. producer of recycled, high density polyethylene, a widely used form of plastic. 
CCC produces 100 million pounds of this recycled, high density polyethylene per year. As for ocean value plastic, 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year, the vast majority is this plastic, about 60% comes from 5 countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. By way of comparison, the United States is responsible for that 4% of waterborne plastics. 
Acutely aware of the damage that Ocean band plastic can cause, CCC created a program that recycled plastics from at risk areas, trying to put a dent in the amount of waste that reaches the beaches and waterways. In 2017, CCC committed to recycling 10 million pounds of ocean value plastics by 2019. And today, it's more than halfway to its goal. While CCC offers a number of services and products to help minimize the impact of plastic on the environment, solutions from manufacturers are only part of the answer. If the goal is to create a circular economy for the packaging industry and eliminate plastic waste, then we need more customers to be willing to buy and use recycled resin in their products, which to date have not been the case. Also, communities worldwide need to develop the proper infrastructure to support recycling. As consumer demand for recycled plastic products increases, CCC is ready, willing and able to provide them.
Moving on, I want to give a quick shoutout to Diamond Offshore. In recent contract negotiations, the company has increased its backlog on 3 drillships by 5 years. This level of activity is designed the demand for offshore drilling rigs is increasing as well as a testament to Diamond Offshore's reputation and operational excellence. Well done.
And finally, before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Adelson, I want to talk briefly about share repurchases. Year-to-date through last Friday, Loews has repurchased 16.6 million shares of its stock or 5% of the outstanding shares, at a total cost of approximately $840 million. These buybacks reflect our confidence in the underlying businesses as well as our belief that the intrinsic value of Loews is significantly higher from the market price for our shares. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation tools for creating long-term value for our shareholders.
And now, David, over to you."
285930,573549432,1513407,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, potentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69, as average shares outstanding decline",933,"Thank you, Jim, good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, potentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69, as average shares outstanding declined 5% due to share repurchase activity. Before I walk through the key drivers for the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the recently closed purchase of the common units of Boardwalk Pipeline not previously owned by Loews as well as the status of our parent company portfolio of cash and investments.
As Jim committed, we spend approximately $1.5 billion in the Boardwalk transaction. Following the transaction and our share repurchase activity, the parent company investment portfolio stands at approximately $3.1 billion, down from $4.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with our strategy of holding substantial liquidity, we are rebalancing the parent company portfolio more towards cash and equivalents. I would note that even after the boys were up transaction, we hold cash and investments far exceeding our $1.8 billion of parent company debt. The rating agencies have all maintained that Loews' ratings and outlooks.
Now for some comments on our segments. CNA contributed net income of $240 million in Q2, down slightly from the second quarter of 2017. P&C underwriting income was up year-over-year as CNA posted a combined ratio of 93.8, basically comparable to last year's second quarter, along with a 5% increase in net earned premium. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after tax underwriting income.
Investment income was also strong with improved returns on the LP portfolio and higher after tax returns on a fixed income portfolio. CNA incurred a one-time cost in Q2 2018 as it transition to our new IT infrastructure service provider. Additionally, CNA had significant realized gains in last year's second quarter versus minimal realized losses this year.
CNA score income, which excludes realized gains and losses was up 13% in the quarter. Diamond Offshore contributed a net loss of $37 million in Q2 2018 as compared to net income of $7 million last year. Diamond's profit margin was hurt by a 32% year-over-year decline in content drilling revenues versus only a 3.6% decline in contract drilling costs. 
Revenue-earning days and average daily revenue were both down. Diamond booked rig impairment charges in both periods, which reduce Diamond's contribution to our net income by $12 million this year and $23 million in last year's second quarter. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $16 million, up from $6 million in Q2 2017. During Q2 2017, Boardwalk's net income contribution reflected a $15 million loss on the sale of a processing facility. Excluding this loss, Boardwalk's contribution declined $5 million year-over-year. Boardwalk experienced a 7% year-over-year decline in net operating revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects did not make up for the negative revenue impact including the 2017 restructuring of the firm transportation agreement, a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues and contract expirations. 
Boardwalk's operating expenses were up slightly due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. For many months, equity analysts were overestimating Boardwalk's revenue and earnings prospects for the second quarter and full year. I would note that the company's performance is consistent with our expectation and those of Boardwalk management. As a reminder, Boardwalk will continue to follow with the SEC because it has bonds outstanding. However, the company will no longer hold quarterly earnings calls.
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $17 million, up from $10 million in Q2 2017. Miami Beach drove the increase with [indiscernible], Ventana Canyon, Orlando and many others also contributing. A lower effective tax rate in Q2 2018 enabled Loews Hotels to drop more of its income to the bottom line. 
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplements, rose 8% from last year's second quarter to $66 million. During the third quarter, Loews Hotels and Universal will open the 600-room Aventura Hotel at Universal Orlando. Loews Hotels will then have 6,200 rooms at Universal Orlando with another 2,800 rooms expected to come online in Orlando over the next 2 years. Turning to the parent company.
Pretax investment income was $42 million, up $40 million from the prior year second quarter, driven by higher returns on alternatives, equities and cash. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after tax results in Q2 2018. 
Corporate and other improved $11 million pretax year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of CCC-related transaction expenses in 2018 as well as other corporate expenses. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate. We received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the second quarter, $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As long as Boardwalk maintains its current distribution, our quarterly distribution from Boardwalk would be close to $26 million going forward. CNA announces this morning a $0.05 increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.35. At that rate, Loews will receive ordinary dividend of $85 million quarterly and $340 million annually from CNA before considering it special dividend. 
We repurchased 5.8 million shares during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of $290 million. During July, we have repurchased another 1 million shares for $49 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased a total of 16.6 million year-to-date representing 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Finally, I'd point out that the accounting for the Boardwalk transaction resulted in our book value, increasing by $2 per share at June 30. Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

My own belief is that CNA is very cheap going into this earnings call. CNA reported what we at Loews thought were very good earnings. And as a result, the stock is down 3% or 4% today. So I am very surprised at CNA's price auction. As you all know, we bought a lot of Loews shares, 5% of the shares just this year. And a lot of the reason for the purchase of the shares was because we believe in CNA and CNA is such a big factor in the Loews share price. There's 0.77 CNA shares for every Loews share. And as I said previously, the value of CNA to Loews drives the value of our other subsidiaries. So in my view, not only our CNA share is down, but also the sum of the parts is quite dramatic to us. So it makes us, I would say, surprised at what's going on in terms of the valuations of CNA and the Loews, but I guess, it's better for us. Us, meaning the shareholders who is building the company."

To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulato",1152,"Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, we began to rethink the efficacy and wisdom of the MLP structure for Boardwalk. After careful consideration of all options, we determined that exercising our call provision was in the best interest of Loews' shareholders. 
On June 29, we announced that we would redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price of $12.06 per share, for a total cost to Loews of slightly over $1.5 billion. The transaction closed in July. We were able to execute this transaction by camping -- tapping the ample liquidity in the Loews corporate treasury. I'll be talking more about Boardwalk on future calls. 
Now on to other Loews business. Loews had a strong second quarter, positively impacted once again by consistent earnings from CNA. Premium growth for CNA remains strong and the company saw positive rate trends in the second quarter. Additionally, the underlying loss ratio improved in the first half of the year from an already strong base. 
Earlier this morning, CNA announced a 17% increase in its regular dividend, reporting CNA's strong operating results and outline. And while around the subject of CNA, but also, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Craig Mense, who is retiring after serving as the CNA Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. The company's fortress balance sheet today is due, in large part, to Craig's extraordinary focus and outstanding fiscal management. Craig, if you are listening, we at Loews thank you for your tremendous service and wish you a wonderful retirement.
Next, I'd like to do a 1-year checking on our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company or CCC. Loews acquired CCC and the transaction had closed in May of last year. And I'm happy to report that the business is performing well. In 2018, we expect CCC to produce double digit cash-on-cash returns on our equity investment. For anyone who may need a quick review, CCC is the leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company makes containers for stable end markets, such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. With the acquisition of CCC, Loews added a new industry to its already diverse portfolio of businesses as well as another platform for growth.
When we acquired CCC a year ago, we talked about our desire to grow the business. And the CCC team has started that process by making 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company has bid on more sizable acquisitions, only to find out, for the bigger companies, the prices have been too high. CCC is happy to be patient while continuing to look for additional acquisition targets. We hope to have more to report in this area in the quarters ahead.
Another reason we were attracted to CCC were the strong and experienced management team as well as its track record of operational excellence. Happily, time has only added to our positive opinion of CCC's senior leadership team. Over the last year, CEO Sean Fallman and his team have focused on creating greater efficiencies and streamlining production processes to obtain better margins. 
Additionally, CCC has placed increased emphasis on their innovative, Dura-Lite technology, a patented design that utilizes less resin while creating beverage packaging of higher strength and improved customer ergonomics. For CCC, the Dura-Lite technology has had to increased unit volume and has enhanced relationship with customers. Dura-Lite is better for CCC's customers, who are now spending less on packaging materials, and better for the environment as well.
And while we're on the subject of the environment, there's been a lot of discussion in the news recently about plastics and their effect on our planet. This is an extremely important issue and one that both Loews and CCC take seriously. 
Today, I want to talk about 2 aspects of plastics in the environment: single-use plastics such as straw, disposable, cutlery and plastic lids; and plastic waste that pollutes the world's oceans. First, I'd like to emphasize that CCC is not in the business of producing single-use plastic items. Its focus is on producing primary packaging designed to protect and extend the shelf life of the contents inside. Of all the packaging that CCC produces, 97% is fully recyclable. In addition to manufacturing and packaging, CCC is also the second largest U.S. producer of recycled, high-density polyethylene, a widely used form of plastic. 
CCC produces 100 million pounds of this recycled, high-density polyethylene per year. As for ocean-bound plastic, 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year. The vast majority of this plastic, about 60% comes from 5 countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. By way of comparison, the United States is responsible for that 4% of waterborne plastics. 
Acutely aware of the damage that ocean-bound plastic can cause, CCC created a program that recycles plastic from at-risk areas, trying to put a dent in the amount of waste that reaches the beaches and waterways. In 2017, CCC committed to recycling 10 million pounds of ocean-bound plastic by 2019. And today, it's more than halfway to its goal. While CCC offers a number of services and products to help minimize the impact of plastic on the environment, solutions from manufacturers are only part of the answer. If the goal is to create a circular economy for the packaging industry and eliminate plastic waste, then we need more companies to be willing to buy and use recycled resin in their products, which to date, have not been the case. Also, communities worldwide need to develop the proper infrastructure to support recycling. As consumer demand for recycled plastic products increases, CCC is ready, willing and able to provide them.
Moving on, I want to give a quick shout-out to Diamond Offshore. In recent contract negotiations, the company has increased its backlog on 3 drillships by 5 years. This level of activity is a sign that demand for offshore drilling rigs is increasing as well as a testament to Diamond Offshore's reputation and operational excellence. Well done.
And finally, before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk briefly about share repurchases. Year-to-date through last Friday, Loews has repurchased 16.6 million shares of its stock, or 5% of the outstanding shares, at a total cost of approximately $840 million. These buybacks reflect our confidence in the underlying businesses as well as our belief that the intrinsic value of Loews is significantly higher than the market price for our shares. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation tools for creating long-term value for our shareholders.
And now, David, over to you."
285930,573549432,1513473,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter.

Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding declined 5% due to share repurchase activity. Before I walk through the key drivers for the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the recently closed purchase of the common units of Boardwalk Pipeline not previously owned by Loews as well as the status of our parent company portfolio of cash and investments.
As Jim committed, we spent approximately $1.5 billion in the Boardwalk transaction. Following the transaction and our share repurchase activity, the parent company investment portfolio stands at approximately $3.1 billion, down from $4.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with our strategy of holding substantial liquidity, we are rebalancing the parent company portfolio more toward cash and equivalents. I would note that even after the Boardwalk transaction, we hold cash and investments far exceeding our $1.8 billion of parent company debt. The rating agencies have all maintained the -- Loews' ratings and outlooks.
Now for some comments on our segments. CNA contributed net income of $240 million in Q2, down slightly from the second quarter of 2017. P&C underwriting income was up year-over-year as CNA posted a combined ratio of 93.8, basically comparable to last year's second quarter, along with a 5% increase in net earned premium. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after tax underwriting income. Investment income was also strong, with improved returns on the LP portfolio and higher after-tax returns on the fixed income portfolio. CNA incurred one-time costs in Q2 2018 as it transitioned to a new IT infrastructure service provider. Additionally, CNA had significant realized gains in last year's second quarter versus minimal realized losses this year. CNA's core income, which excludes realized gains and losses, was up 13% in the quarter. 
Diamond Offshore contributed a net loss of $37 million in Q2 2018 as compared to net income of $7 million last year. Diamond's profit margin was hurt by a 32% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues versus only a 3.6% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue-earning days and average daily revenue were both down. Diamond booked rig impairment charges in both periods, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our net income by $12 million this year and $23 million in last year's second quarter. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $16 million, up from $6 million in Q2 2017. During Q2 2017, Boardwalk's net income contribution reflected a $15 million loss on the sale of a processing facility. Excluding this loss, Boardwalk's contribution declined $5 million year-over-year. Boardwalk experienced a 7% year-over-year decline in net operating revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects did not make up for the negative revenue impact, including the 2017 restructuring of the firm transportation agreement, a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues and contract expirations.
Boardwalk's operating expenses were up slightly due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. For many months, equity analysts were overestimating Boardwalk's revenue and earnings prospects for the second quarter and full year. I would note that the company's performance is consistent with our expectations and those of Boardwalk management. As a reminder, Boardwalk will continue to file with the SEC because it has bonds outstanding. However, the company will no longer hold quarterly earnings calls.
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $17 million, up from $10 million in Q2 2017. Miami Beach drove the increase with Coronado, Ventana Canyon, Orlando and many others also contributing. A lower effective tax rate in Q2 2018 enabled Loews Hotels to drop more of its income to the bottom line.  Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplements, rose 8% from last year's second quarter to $66 million. During the third quarter, Loews Hotels and Universal will open the 600-room Aventura Hotel at Universal Orlando. Loews Hotels will then have 6,200 rooms at Universal Orlando, with another 2,800 rooms expected to come online in Orlando over the next 2 years. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $42 million, up $40 million from the prior year second quarter, driven by higher returns on alternatives, equities and cash. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after-tax results in Q2 2018. 
Corporate and other improved $11 million pretax year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of CCC-related transaction expenses in 2018 as well as other corporate expenses. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rates. We received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the second quarter: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As long as Boardwalk maintains its current distribution, our quarterly distribution from Boardwalk would be close to $26 million going forward. CNA announced this morning a $0.05 increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.35. At that rate, Loews would receive ordinary dividend of $85 million quarterly and $340 million annually from CNA, before considering it special dividend. 
We repurchased 5.8 million shares during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of $290 million. During July, we have repurchased another 1 million shares for $49 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased a total of 16.6 million year-to-date, representing 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Finally, I'd point out that the accounting for the Boardwalk transaction resulted in our book value increasing by $2 per share at June 30. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

My own belief is that CNA is very cheap, going into this earnings call. CNA reported what we at Loews thought was very good earnings. And as a result, the stock is down 3% or 4% today. So I am very surprised at CNA's price auction. As you all know, we bought a lot of Loews shares, 5% of the shares just this year. And a lot of the reason for the purchase of the shares was because we believe in CNA, and CNA is such a big factor in the Loews' share price. There's 0.77 CNA shares for every Loews share. And as I said previously, the value of CNA to Loews dwarfs the value of our other subsidiaries. So in my view, not only our CNA share is down, but also, the sum of the parts is quite dramatic to us. So it makes us, I would say, surprised at just what's going on in terms of the valuations of CNA and then Loews. But I guess, it's better for us. Us, meaning the shareholders who is building the company."

To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulato",1152,"Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, we began to rethink the efficacy and wisdom of the MLP structure for Boardwalk. After careful consideration of all options, we determined that exercising our call provision was in the best interest of Loews' shareholders. 
On June 29, we announced that we would redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price of $12.06 per share, for a total cost to Loews of slightly over $1.5 billion. The transaction closed in July. We were able to execute this transaction by camping -- tapping the ample liquidity in the Loews corporate treasury. I'll be talking more about Boardwalk on future calls. 
Now on to other Loews business. Loews had a strong second quarter, positively impacted once again by consistent earnings from CNA. Premium growth for CNA remains strong and the company saw positive rate trends in the second quarter. Additionally, the underlying loss ratio improved in the first half of the year from an already strong base. 
Earlier this morning, CNA announced a 17% increase in its regular dividend, reporting CNA's strong operating results and outline. And while around the subject of CNA, but also, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Craig Mense, who is retiring after serving as the CNA Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. The company's fortress balance sheet today is due, in large part, to Craig's extraordinary focus and outstanding fiscal management. Craig, if you are listening, we at Loews thank you for your tremendous service and wish you a wonderful retirement.
Next, I'd like to do a 1-year checking on our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company or CCC. Loews acquired CCC and the transaction had closed in May of last year. And I'm happy to report that the business is performing well. In 2018, we expect CCC to produce double digit cash-on-cash returns on our equity investment. For anyone who may need a quick review, CCC is the leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company makes containers for stable end markets, such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. With the acquisition of CCC, Loews added a new industry to its already diverse portfolio of businesses as well as another platform for growth.
When we acquired CCC a year ago, we talked about our desire to grow the business. And the CCC team has started that process by making 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company has bid on more sizable acquisitions, only to find out, for the bigger companies, the prices have been too high. CCC is happy to be patient while continuing to look for additional acquisition targets. We hope to have more to report in this area in the quarters ahead.
Another reason we were attracted to CCC were the strong and experienced management team as well as its track record of operational excellence. Happily, time has only added to our positive opinion of CCC's senior leadership team. Over the last year, CEO Sean Fallman and his team have focused on creating greater efficiencies and streamlining production processes to obtain better margins. 
Additionally, CCC has placed increased emphasis on their innovative, Dura-Lite technology, a patented design that utilizes less resin while creating beverage packaging of higher strength and improved customer ergonomics. For CCC, the Dura-Lite technology has had to increased unit volume and has enhanced relationship with customers. Dura-Lite is better for CCC's customers, who are now spending less on packaging materials, and better for the environment as well.
And while we're on the subject of the environment, there's been a lot of discussion in the news recently about plastics and their effects on our planet. This is an extremely important issue and one that both Loews and CCC take seriously. 
Today, I want to talk about 2 aspects of plastics in the environment: single-use plastics such as straw, disposable, cutlery and plastic lids; and plastic waste that pollutes the world's oceans. First, I'd like to emphasize that CCC is not in the business of producing single-use plastic items. Its focus is on producing primary packaging designed to protect and extend the shelf life of the contents inside. Of all the packaging that CCC produces, 97% is fully recyclable. In addition to manufacturing and packaging, CCC is also the second largest U.S. producer of recycled, high-density polyethylene, a widely used form of plastic. 
CCC produces 100 million pounds of this recycled, high-density polyethylene per year. As for ocean-bound plastic, 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year. The vast majority of this plastic, about 60% comes from 5 countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. By way of comparison, the United States is responsible for that 4% of waterborne plastics. 
Acutely aware of the damage that ocean-bound plastic can cause, CCC created a program that recycles plastic from at-risk areas, trying to put a dent in the amount of waste that reaches the beaches and waterways. In 2017, CCC committed to recycling 10 million pounds of ocean-bound plastic by 2019. And today, it's more than halfway to its goal. While CCC offers a number of services and products to help minimize the impact of plastic on the environment, solutions from manufacturers are only part of the answer. If the goal is to create a circular economy for the packaging industry and eliminate plastic waste, then we need more companies to be willing to buy and use recycled resin in their products, which to date, have not been the case. Also, communities worldwide need to develop the proper infrastructure to support recycling. As consumer demand for recycled plastic products increases, CCC is ready, willing and able to provide them.
Moving on, I want to give a quick shout-out to Diamond Offshore. In recent contract negotiations, the company has increased its backlog on 3 drillships by 5 years. This level of activity is a sign that demand for offshore drilling rigs is increasing as well as a testament to Diamond Offshore's reputation and operational excellence. Well done.
And finally, before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk briefly about share repurchases. Year-to-date through last Friday, Loews has repurchased 16.6 million shares of its stock, or 5% of the outstanding shares, at a total cost of approximately $840 million. These buybacks reflect our confidence in the underlying businesses as well as our belief that the intrinsic value of Loews is significantly higher than the market price for our shares. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation tools for creating long-term value for our shareholders.
And now, David, over to you."
285930,573549432,1521757,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding decl",929,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding declined 5% due to share repurchase activity. Before I walk through the key drivers for the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the recently closed purchase of the common units of Boardwalk Pipeline not previously owned by Loews as well as the status of our parent company portfolio of cash and investments.
As Jim commented, we spent approximately $1.5 billion in the Boardwalk transaction. Following the transaction and our share repurchase activity, the parent company investment portfolio stands at approximately $3.1 billion, down from $4.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with our strategy of holding substantial liquidity, we are rebalancing the parent company portfolio more toward cash and equivalents. I would note that even after the Boardwalk transaction, we hold cash and investments far exceeding our $1.8 billion of parent company debt. The rating agencies have all maintained the Loews' ratings and outlooks.
Now for some comments on our segments. CNA contributed net income of $240 million in Q2, down slightly from the second quarter of 2017. P&C underwriting income was up year-over-year as CNA posted a combined ratio of 93.8, basically comparable to last year's second quarter, along with a 5% increase in net earned premium. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after tax underwriting income. Investment income was also strong, with improved returns on the LP portfolio and higher after-tax returns on the fixed income portfolio. CNA incurred one-time costs in Q2 2018 as it transitioned to a new IT infrastructure service provider. Additionally, CNA had significant realized gains in last year's second quarter versus minimal realized losses this year. CNA's core income, which excludes realized gains and losses, was up 13% in the quarter. 
Diamond Offshore contributed a net loss of $37 million in Q2 2018 as compared to net income of $7 million last year. Diamond's profit margin was hurt by a 32% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues versus only a 3.6% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue-earning days and average daily revenue were both down. Diamond booked rig impairment charges in both periods, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our net income by $12 million this year and $23 million in last year's second quarter. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $16 million, up from $6 million in Q2 2017. During Q2 2017, Boardwalk's net income contribution reflected a $15 million loss on the sale of a processing facility. Excluding this loss, Boardwalk's contribution declined $5 million year-over-year. Boardwalk experienced a 7% year-over-year decline in net operating revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects did not make up for the negative revenue impact, including the 2017 restructuring of the firm transportation agreement, a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues and contract expirations.
Boardwalk's operating expenses were up slightly due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. For many months, equity analysts were overestimating Boardwalk's revenue and earnings prospects for the second quarter and full year. I would note that the company's performance is consistent with our expectations and those of Boardwalk management. As a reminder, Boardwalk will continue to file with the SEC because it has bonds outstanding. However, the company will no longer hold quarterly earnings calls.
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $17 million, up from $10 million in Q2 2017. Miami Beach drove the increase with Coronado, Ventana Canyon, Orlando and many others also contributing. A lower effective tax rate in Q2 2018 enabled Loews Hotels to drop more of its income to the bottom line.  Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplements, rose 8% from last year's second quarter to $66 million. During the third quarter, Loews Hotels and Universal will open a 600-room Aventura Hotel at Universal Orlando. Loews Hotels will then have 6,200 rooms at Universal Orlando, with another 2,800 rooms expected to come online in Orlando over the next 2 years. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $42 million, up $40 million from the prior year second quarter, driven by higher returns on alternatives, equities and cash. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after-tax results in Q2 2018. 
Corporate and other improved $11 million pretax year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of CCC-related transaction expenses in 2018 as well as other corporate expenses. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rates. We received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the second quarter: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As long as Boardwalk maintains its current distribution, our quarterly distribution from Boardwalk would be close to $26 million going forward. CNA announced this morning a $0.05 increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.35. At that rate, Loews would receive ordinary dividend of $85 million quarterly and $340 million annually from CNA, before considering it special dividend. 
We repurchased 5.8 million shares during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of $290 million. During July, we have repurchased another 1 million shares for $49 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased a total of 16.6 million year-to-date, representing 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Finally, I'd point out that the accounting for the Boardwalk transaction resulted in our book value increasing by $2 per share at June 30. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

My own belief is that CNA is very cheap, going into this earnings call. CNA reported what we at Loews thought was very good earnings. And as a result, the stock is down 3% or 4% today. So I am very surprised at CNA's price auction. As you all know, we bought a lot of Loews shares, 5% of the shares just this year. And a lot of the reason for the purchase of the shares was because we believe in CNA, and CNA is such a big factor in the Loews' share price. There's 0.77 CNA shares for every Loews share. And as I said previously, the value of CNA to Loews dwarfs the value of our other subsidiaries. So in my view, not only are CNA share is down, but also, the sum of the parts is quite dramatic to us. So it makes us, I would say, surprised at just what's going on in terms of the valuations of CNA and then Loews. But I guess, it's better for us.

To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulato",1151,"Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews' decision to redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, we began to rethink the efficacy and wisdom of the MLP structure for Boardwalk. After careful consideration of all options, we determined that exercising our call provision was in the best interest of Loews' shareholders. 
On June 29, we announced that we would redeem Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price of $12.06 per share, for a total cost to Loews of slightly over $1.5 billion. The transaction closed in July. We were able to execute this transaction by camping -- tapping the ample liquidity in the Loews corporate treasury. I'll be talking more about Boardwalk on future calls. 
Now on to other Loews business. Loews had a strong second quarter, positively impacted once again by consistent earnings from CNA. Premium growth for CNA remains strong and the company saw positive rate trends in the second quarter. Additionally, the underlying loss ratio improved in the first half of the year from an already strong base. 
Earlier this morning, CNA announced a 17% increase in its regular dividend, reporting CNA's strong operating results and outline. And while around the subject of CNA, but also, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Craig Mense, who is retiring after serving as the CNA Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. The company's fortress balance sheet today is due, in large part, to Craig's extraordinary focus and outstanding fiscal management. Craig, if you are listening, we at Loews thank you for your tremendous service and wish you a wonderful retirement.
Next, I'd like to do a 1-year checking on our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company or CCC. Loews acquired CCC and the transaction had closed in May of last year. And I'm happy to report that the business is performing well. In 2018, we expect CCC to produce double-digit cash-on-cash returns on our equity investment. For anyone who may need a quick review, CCC is the leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company makes containers for stable end markets, such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. With the acquisition of CCC, Loews added a new industry to its already diverse portfolio of businesses as well as another platform for growth.
When we acquired CCC a year ago, we talked about our desire to grow the business. And the CCC team has started that process by making 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company has bid on more sizable acquisitions, only to find out, for the bigger companies, the prices have been too high. CCC is happy to be patient while continuing to look for additional acquisition targets. We hope to have more to report in this area in the quarters ahead.
Another reason we were attracted to CCC were the strong and experienced management team as well as its track record of operational excellence. Happily, time has only added to our positive opinion of CCC's senior leadership team. Over the last year, CEO Sean Fallman and his team have focused on creating greater efficiencies and streamlining production processes to obtain better margins. 
Additionally, CCC has placed increased emphasis on their innovative, Dura-Lite technology, a patented design that utilizes less resin while creating beverage packaging of higher strength and improved customer ergonomics. For CCC, the Dura-Lite technology has had to increased unit volume and has enhanced relationship with customers. Dura-Lite is better for CCC's customers, who are now spending less on packaging materials, and better for the environment as well.
And while we're on the subject of the environment, there's been a lot of discussion in the news recently about plastics and their effects on our planet. This is an extremely important issue and one that both Loews and CCC take seriously. 
Today, I want to talk about 2 aspects of plastics in the environment: single-use plastics such as straw, disposable, cutlery and plastic lids; and plastic waste that pollutes the world's oceans. First, I'd like to emphasize that CCC is not in the business of producing single-use plastic items. Its focus is on producing primary packaging designed to protect and extend the shelf life of the contents inside. Of all the packaging that CCC produces, 97% is fully recyclable. In addition to manufacturing and packaging, CCC is also the second largest U.S. producer of recycled, high-density polyethylene, a widely used form of plastic. 
CCC produces 100 million pounds of this recycled, high-density polyethylene per year. As for ocean-bound plastic, 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year. The vast majority of this plastic, about 60% comes from 5 countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. By way of comparison, the United States is responsible for that 4% of waterborne plastics. 
Acutely aware of the damage that ocean-bound plastic can cause, CCC created a program that recycles plastic from at-risk areas, trying to put a dent in the amount of waste that reaches the beaches and waterways. In 2017, CCC committed to recycling 10 million pounds of ocean-bound plastic by 2019. And today, it's more than halfway to its goal. While CCC offers a number of services and products to help minimize the impact of plastic on the environment, solutions from manufacturers are only part of the answer. If the goal is to create a circular economy for the packaging industry and eliminate plastic waste, then we need more companies to be willing to buy and use recycled resin in their products, which to date, have not been the case. Also, communities worldwide need to develop the proper infrastructure to support recycling. As consumer demand for recycled plastic products increases, CCC is ready, willing and able to provide them.
Moving on, I want to give a quick shout-out to Diamond Offshore. In recent contract negotiations, the company has increased its backlog on 3 drillships by 5 years. This level of activity is a sign that demand for offshore drilling rigs is increasing as well as a testament to Diamond Offshore's reputation and operational excellence. Well done.
And finally, before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk briefly about share repurchases. Year-to-date through last Friday, Loews has repurchased 16.6 million shares of its stock, or 5% of the outstanding shares, at a total cost of approximately $840 million. These buybacks reflect our confidence in the underlying businesses as well as our belief that the intrinsic value of Loews is significantly higher than the market price for our shares. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation tools for creating long-term value for our shareholders.

285930,573549432,1522482,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding decl",929,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding declined 5% due to share repurchase activity. Before I walk through the key drivers for the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the recently closed purchase of the common units of Boardwalk Pipeline not previously owned by Loews as well as the status of our parent company portfolio of cash and investments.
As Jim commented, we spent approximately $1.5 billion in the Boardwalk transaction. Following the transaction and our share repurchase activity, the parent company investment portfolio stands at approximately $3.1 billion, down from $4.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with our strategy of holding substantial liquidity, we are rebalancing the parent company portfolio more toward cash and equivalents. I would note that even after the Boardwalk transaction, we hold cash and investments far exceeding our $1.8 billion of parent company debt. The rating agencies have all maintained the Loews' ratings and outlooks.
Now for some comments on our segments. CNA contributed net income of $240 million in Q2, down slightly from the second quarter of 2017. P&C underwriting income was up year-over-year as CNA posted a combined ratio of 93.8, basically comparable to last year's second quarter, along with a 5% increase in net earned premium. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after tax underwriting income. Investment income was also strong, with improved returns on the LP portfolio and higher after-tax returns on the fixed income portfolio. CNA incurred onetime costs in Q2 2018 as it transitioned to a new IT infrastructure service provider. Additionally, CNA had significant realized gains in last year's second quarter versus minimal realized losses this year. CNA's core income, which excludes realized gains and losses, was up 13% in the quarter. 
Diamond Offshore contributed a net loss of $37 million in Q2 2018 as compared to net income of $7 million last year. Diamond's profit margin was hurt by a 32% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues versus only a 3.6% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue-earning days and average daily revenue were both down. Diamond booked rig impairment charges in both periods, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our net income by $12 million this year and $23 million in last year's second quarter. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $16 million, up from $6 million in Q2 2017. During Q2 2017, Boardwalk's net income contribution reflected a $15 million loss on the sale of a processing facility. Excluding this loss, Boardwalk's contribution declined $5 million year-over-year. Boardwalk experienced a 7% year-over-year decline in net operating revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects did not make up for the negative revenue impact, including the 2017 restructuring of the firm transportation agreement, a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues and contract expirations.
Boardwalk's operating expenses were up slightly due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. For many months, equity analysts were overestimating Boardwalk's revenue and earnings prospects for the second quarter and full year. I would note that the company's performance is consistent with our expectations and those of Boardwalk management. As a reminder, Boardwalk will continue to file with the SEC because it has bonds outstanding. However, the company will no longer hold quarterly earnings calls.
Loews Hotels contributed net income of $17 million, up from $10 million in Q2 2017. Miami Beach drove the increase with Coronado, Ventana Canyon, Orlando and many others also contributing. A lower effective tax rate in Q2 2018 enabled Loews Hotels to drop more of its income to the bottom line. Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplements, rose 8% from last year's second quarter to $66 million. During the third quarter, Loews Hotels and Universal will open a 600-room Aventura Hotel at Universal Orlando. Loews Hotels will then have 6,200 rooms at Universal Orlando, with another 2,800 rooms expected to come online in Orlando over the next 2 years. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $42 million, up $40 million from the prior year second quarter, driven by higher returns on alternatives, equities and cash. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after-tax results in Q2 2018. 
Corporate and other improved $11 million pretax year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of CCC-related transaction expenses in 2018 as well as other corporate expenses. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rates. We received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the second quarter: $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As long as Boardwalk maintains its current distribution, our quarterly distribution from Boardwalk would be close to $26 million going forward. CNA announced this morning a $0.05 increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.35. At that rate, Loews would receive ordinary dividend of $85 million quarterly and $340 million annually from CNA, before considering it special dividend. 
We repurchased 5.8 million shares during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of $290 million. During July, we have repurchased another 1 million shares for $49 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased a total of 16.6 million year-to-date, representing 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Finally, I'd point out that the accounting for the Boardwalk transaction resulted in our book value increasing by $2 per share at June 30. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

So I am very surprised at CNA's price auction. As you all know, we bought a lot of Loews shares, 5% of the shares just this year. And a lot of the reason for the purchase of the shares was because we believe in CNA, and CNA is such a big factor in the Loews' share price. There's 0.77 CNA shares for every Loews share. And as I said previously, the value of CNA to Loews dwarfs the value of our other subsidiaries. So in my view, not only are CNA share is down, but also, the sum of the parts is quite dramatic to us.

285930,586898850,1591232,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2018",2018-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary. Today, I'd like to talk briefly about two things, CNA and share repurchases. CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results in more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome,",631,"Thank you, Mary. Today, I'd like to talk briefly about two things, CNA and share repurchases. CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results in more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome, at Loews, we understand if there are a number of factors that can positively or negatively impact earnings and for that reason, we focus on making decisions and running businesses for the long term, and we continue to see positive outcomes from some of the decisions made over the past decade at CNA.
CNA has worked hard to strengthen its underwriting talent, improved technology, it's technology infrastructure and expand its distribution network, all while maintaining its fortress balance sheet. CNA has also actively managed the risks from its runoff, long-term-care segment.
On their earnings call earlier this morning, the company's CEO, Dino Robusto, and CFO James Anderson, walk shareholders through additional details about their long-term care book of business. CNA's proactive management of this business, together with its reserve unlocking at year-end 2015, has led to several years of stable results. And at Loews, we feel great about how they've handled it.
Let me hit some of the highlights that Dino and James talked about. First, the long-term care business is a closed book of business that's in runoff mode. CNA has not written a new individual long-term care policy since 2003. And since 2015, the number of individual policyholders has decreased by 15%. Also, around 2003, CNA stopped accepting a new group long-term care policies. The active lives in these group policies have declined 29% since the end of 2015. Additionally, CNA's long-term care book of business is mature. The company has processed more than 100,000 claims, which have yielded solid data that CNA is using to model reserves for the segment going forward.
We are confident that CNA's long-term care reserves are built on prudent assumptions. For example, CNA's reserves assume only rate increases that CNA has already filed but have not yet been approved, or rate increases that the company plans to file in the near future as part of a current rate increase program. Beyond that, no other rate increases are assumed.
At Loews, we're very interested in CNA's long-term care book of business and their active management of it. We engage with CNA regularly about the company's strategic direction for the long-term care segment as well as its reserves, and we feel confident that CNA is adequately reserved and is managing the business appropriately.
And if you need more proof of how we feel about CNA, look no further than our share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2014, we have purchased about 74 million shares of Loews stock at a total cost of $3.2 billion, fully cognizant of CNA's long-term-care exposure. As our largest subsidiary, CNA makes up a significant portion of the value of each Loews common share, so our buybacks underscore the confidence we feel in our insurance subsidiaries long-term value-creation power.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.5% of our outstanding common stock or more than 18 million shares at a total cost of about $920 million.
Our long-term listeners to this call know, at Lowe's, we don't have an automatic share repurchase program, buying shares no matter what. We are very sensitive to the price we pay for anything, especially our shares. When we can repurchase Loews' shares at below our view of their intrinsic value, we feel that's a great use of our cash. Share buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to invest in our business, while also rewarding long-term holders of the stock. Rather than complain about the prices of Loews and CNA, we recognize the gift that the markets are giving us, and we buy our shares.
Over to you, David."
285930,586898850,1591232,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2018",2018-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter.

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter. Our EPS comparison benefited from share repurchase activity over the past 12 months.
Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers. A quick summary of the quarter. CNA accounted for the bulk of our year-over-year net income improvement as lower catastrophe losses and continued strong underlying -- underwriting income drove the results.
Boardwalk and Loews Hotels also posted favorable year-over-year contributions. Offsetting these increases were lower contributions from Diamond Offshore and the parent company investment portfolio. As in Q1 and Q2, the lower corporate tax rate benefited our year-over-year after-tax results.
Now for more detail. CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $300 million, up $170 million from Q3 2017. P&C underwriting income drove the increase. CNA's third quarter combined ratio improved almost 10 points from 103.7 in 2017 to 94.2 in 2018, translating into a $161 million increase in pretax P&C underwriting income at CNA. Lower catastrophe losses at CNA drove the year-over-year underwriting improvement. In 2017, CNA had pretax catastrophe losses of $269 million or 16.5 points versus only $46 million or 2.6 points in this year's third quarter. Catastrophe losses reduced Loews' third quarter net income by $32 million this year versus $170 million last year.
CNA booked favorable prior-year development in both Q3 2018 and Q3 2017, although the amount of favorable development was less this year than last, partially offsetting the earnings impact of this substantially lower catastrophe losses.
CNA's underlying combined ratio of 94.8, which excludes cats and prior-year development was essentially in line with last year's third quarter. Other factors favorably impacting CNA's year-over-year comparison were higher after-tax net investment income, the absence this year of last year's loss on the early redemption of debt and higher income in the Life & Group segment, which includes long-term-care. CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly earnings presentation, which can be found on its IR website. Please note that CNA completed its long-term care reserve review in Q3 and intends to shift its reserve review to the third quarter going forward.
The company's GAAP LTC reserves, which totaled just under $12 billion, are split approximately 77-23 between reserves for future policy benefits also known as active life reserves, and claims reserves. This year's review resulted in the modest favorable release from its claims reserve and no unlocking of its active life reserves.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $27 million in Q3 2018 as compared to net income of $6 million last year, reflecting their continued decline in drilling activity and average day rate for Diamond feet. Contract drilling revenues declined 21% versus only a 5% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down as the company experienced contract expirations as well as rigs rolling to lower day rates. Unusual items affected Diamond's earnings in both years' third quarters. Diamond's 2018 contribution was reduced by $8 million because of a legal settlement last year, a loss on the early retirement of debt reduced our earnings by $11 million.
Diamond continues to focus on ensuring it has ample liquidity during this extended market trough. At the beginning of our them October, Diamond executed a new 5-year $950 million revolving credit facility. The new revolver is in addition to Diamond's existing revolver, which was reduced to $325 million, $100 million, of which matures in 2019 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2020. Currently, both of the facilities remain undrawn.
Boardwalk contributed $28 million to our net income, up from $17 million last year. The year-over-year comparison was affected by Loews' 100% ownership of Boardwalk in Q3 2018 versus 51% last year. Had Loews owned 100% of Boardwalk in last year's third quarter, net income contribution would have declined year-over-year even with the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The decline in profitability stemmed from margin compression, which caused Boardwalk's pretax income to drop from $69 million to $38 million in Q3 2018. The company experienced a $17 million decrease in net operating revenues, a $12 million increase in operating expenses and a slight increase in interest expense. The revenue decline was driven by contract expirations, contract renewals at lower rates, contract restructurings and lower parking & lending and storage results, partially offsetting these declines were revenues generating by the growth projects and higher system utilization. Boardwalk's operating expenses increased because the depreciation property taxes and employee-related costs.
Loews Hotels had a terrific third quarter. Its net income contribution was $11 million, up from $4 million in Q3 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose nearly 17% from last year's third quarter to $49 million. Most Miami Beach and Coronado were the main drivers of the improved performance. Continued earnings growth generated by the universal Orlando joint venture was masked by cost associated with the opening of the 600-room Aventura Hotel during the third quarter.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $5 million, down $43 million from the prior year's third quarter driven by lower returns on equities and alternatives. The corporate tax rate differential between the 2 years benefited the year-over-year after-tax comparison.
Corporate and Other was consistent with the prior year on a pretax basis. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate in Q3 2018. During Q3 2018, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk. We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $88 million. We purchased an additional 1 million shares since quarter end for approximately $47 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased 18.4 million shares during 2018 or about $923 million, representing 5.5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2017.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. As I stated last quarter, we are rebalancing our invested assets in light of the cash used to acquire the Boardwalk units. At quarter-end, cash and equivalents accounted for over 60% of the parent company portfolio.
Let me now turn it back to Mary."

CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly earnings presentation, which can be found on its IR website. Please note that CNA completed its long-term care reserve review in Q3 and intends to shift its reserve review to the third quarter going forward.
The company's GAAP LTC reserves, which totaled just under $12 billion, are split approximately 77-23 between reserves for future policy benefits, also known as active life reserves, and claims reserves. This year's review resulted in a modest favorable release from its claims reserve and no unlocking of its active life reserves.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $27 million in Q3 2018 as compared to net income of $6 million last year, reflecting their continued decline in drilling activity and average day rate for Diamond fleet. Contract drilling revenues declined 21% versus only a 5% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down as the company experienced contract expirations as well as rigs rolling to lower day rates. Unusual items affected Diamond's earnings in both years' third quarters. Diamond's 2018 contribution was reduced by $8 million because of a legal settlement. Last year, a loss on the early retirement of debt reduced our earnings by $11 million.
Diamond continues to focus on ensuring it has ample liquidity during this extended market trough. At the beginning of our October, Diamond executed a new 5-year $950 million revolving credit facility. The new revolver is in addition to Diamond's existing revolver, which was reduced to $325 million, $100 million, of which matures in 2019 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2020. Currently, both of the facilities remain undrawn.
Boardwalk contributed $28 million to our net income, up from $17 million last year. The year-over-year comparison was affected by Loews' 100% ownership of Boardwalk in Q3 2018 versus 51% last year. Had Loews owned 100% of Boardwalk in last year's third quarter, net income contribution would have declined year-over-year even with the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The decline in profitability stemmed from margin compression, which caused Boardwalk's pretax income to drop from $69 million to $38 million in Q3 2018. The company experienced a $17 million decrease in net operating revenues, a $12 million increase in operating expenses and a slight increase in interest expense. The revenue decline was driven by contract expirations, contract renewals at lower rates, contract restructurings and lower parking & lending and storage results. Partially offsetting these declines were revenues generated by the growth projects and higher system utilization. Boardwalk's operating expenses increased because of the depreciation property taxes and employee-related costs.
Loews Hotels had a terrific third quarter. Its net income contribution was $11 million, up from $4 million in Q3 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose nearly 17% from last year's third quarter to $49 million. Loews Most Miami Beach and Coronado were the main drivers of the improved performance. Continued earnings growth generated by the Universal Orlando joint venture was masked by costs associated with the opening of the 600-room Aventura Hotel during the third quarter.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $5 million, down $43 million from the prior year's third quarter driven by lower returns on equities and alternatives. The corporate tax rate differential between the 2 years benefited the year-over-year after-tax comparison.
Corporate and other was consistent with the prior year on a pretax basis. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate in Q3 2018.
During Q3 2018, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk. We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $88 million. We purchased an additional 1 million shares since quarter end for approximately $47 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased 18.4 million shares during 2018 for about $923 million, representing 5.5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2017.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. As I stated last quarter, we are rebalancing our invested assets in light of the cash used to acquire the Boardwalk units. At quarter end, cash and equivalents accounted for over 60% of the parent company portfolio.

285930,586898850,1595913,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2018",2018-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary.

CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results and more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome, at Loews, we understand that there are a number of factors that can positively or negatively impact earnings. And for that reason, we focus on making decisions and running businesses for the long term, and we continue to see positive outcomes from some of the decisions made over the past decade at CNA.
  
  CNA has worked hard to strengthen its underwriting talent, improve its technology infrastructure and expand its distribution network, all while maintaining its fortress balance sheet. CNA has also actively managed the risks from its runoff, long-term care segment.
  
  On their earnings call earlier this morning, the company's CEO, Dino Robusto; and CFO, James Anderson, walked shareholders through additional details about their long-term care book of business. CNA's proactive management of this business, together with its reserve unlocking at year-end 2015, has led to several years of stable results. And at Loews, we feel great about how they've handled it.
  
  Let me hit some of the highlights that Dino and James talked about. First, the long-term care business is a closed book of business that's in runoff mode. CNA has not written a new individual long-term care policy since 2003. And since 2015, the number of individual policyholders has decreased by 15%. Also, around 2003, CNA stopped accepting new group long-term care policies. The active lives in these group policies have declined 29% since the end of 2015. Additionally, CNA's long-term care book of business is mature. The company has processed more than 100,000 claims, which have yielded solid data that CNA is using to model reserves for the segment going forward.
  
  We are confident that CNA's long-term care reserves are built on prudent assumptions. For example, CNA's reserves assume only rate increases that CNA has already filed but have not yet been approved, or rate increases that the company plans to file in the near future as part of a current rate increase program. Beyond that, no other rate increases are assumed.
  
  At Loews, we're very interested in CNA's long-term care book of business and their active management of it. We engage with CNA regularly about the company's strategic direction for the long-term care segment as well as its reserves. And we feel confident that CNA is adequately reserved and is managing the business appropriately.
  
  And if you need more proof of how we feel about CNA, look no further than our share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2014, we have purchased about 74 million shares of Loews stock at a total cost of $3.2 billion, fully cognizant of CNA's long-term care exposure. As our largest subsidiary, CNA makes up a significant portion of the value of each Loews common share, so our buybacks underscore the confidence we feel in our insurance subsidiary's long-term value-creation power. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.5% of our outstanding common stock or more than 18 million shares at a total cost of about $920 million.
  
  As long-term listeners to this call know, at Lowes, we don't have an automatic share repurchase program, buying shares no matter what. We are very sensitive to the price we pay for anything, especially our shares. When we can repurchase Loews shares at below our view of their intrinsic value, we feel that's a great use of our cash. Share buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to invest in our business while also rewarding long-term holders of the stock. Rather than complain about the prices of Loews and CNA, we recognize the gift that the markets are giving us, and we buy our shares.
  
  Over to you, David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter. Our EPS comparison benefited from share repurchase activity over the past 12 months.
  
  Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers.
  
  A quick summary of the quarter. CNA accounted for the bulk of our year-over-year net income improvement as lower catastrophe losses and continued strong underlying -- underwriting income drove the results. Boardwalk and Loews Hotels also posted favorable year-over-year contributions. Offsetting these increases were lower contributions from Diamond Offshore and the parent company investment portfolio. As in Q1 and Q2, the lower corporate tax rate benefited our year-over-year after-tax results.
  
  Now for more detail. CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $300 million, up $170 million from Q3 2017. P&C underwriting income drove the increase. CNA's third quarter combined ratio improved almost 10 points from 103.7 in 2017 to 94.2 in 2018, translating into a $161 million increase in pretax P&C underwriting income at CNA. Lower catastrophe losses at CNA drove the year-over-year underwriting improvement. In 2017, CNA had pretax catastrophe losses of $269 million or 16.5 points versus only $46 million or 2.6 points in this year's third quarter. Catastrophe losses reduced Loews' third quarter net income by $32 million this year versus $170 million last year.
  
  CNA booked favorable prior year development in both Q3 2018 and Q3 2017, although the amount of favorable development was less this year than last, partially offsetting the earnings impact of the substantially lower catastrophe losses.
  
  CNA's underlying combined ratio of 94.8, which excludes cats and prior year development, was essentially in line with last year's third quarter. Other factors favorably impacting CNA's year-over-year comparison were higher after-tax net investment income; the absence this year of last year's loss on the early redemption of debt; and higher income in the Life & Group segment, which includes long-term care.
  
  CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly earnings presentation, which can be found on its IR website. Please note that CNA completed its long-term care reserve review in Q3 and intends to shift its reserve review to the third quarter going forward.
  
  The company's GAAP LTC reserves, which totaled just under $12 billion, are split approximately 77-23 between reserves for future policy benefits, also known as active life reserves, and claims reserves. This year's review resulted in a modest favorable release from its claims reserve and no unlocking of its active life reserves.
  
  Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $27 million in Q3 2018 as compared to net income of $6 million last year, reflecting their continued decline in drilling activity and average day rate for Diamond's fleet. Contract drilling revenues declined 21% versus only a 5% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down as the company experienced contract expirations as well as rigs rolling to lower day rates. Unusual items affected Diamond's earnings in both years' third quarters. Diamond's 2018 contribution was reduced by $8 million because of a legal settlement. Last year, a loss on the early retirement of debt reduced our earnings by $11 million.

The new revolver is in addition to Diamond's existing revolver, which was reduced to $325 million, $100 million of which matures in 2019 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2020. Currently, both of the facilities remain undrawn.
  
  Boardwalk contributed $28 million to our net income, up from $17 million last year. The year-over-year comparison was affected by Loews' 100% ownership of Boardwalk in Q3 2018 versus 51% last year. Had Loews owned 100% of Boardwalk in last year's third quarter, net income contribution would have declined year-over-year even with the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The decline in profitability stemmed from margin compression, which caused Boardwalk's pretax income to drop from $69 million to $38 million in Q3 2018. The company experienced a $17 million decrease in net operating revenues, a $12 million increase in operating expenses and a slight increase in interest expense. The revenue decline was driven by contract expirations, contract renewals at lower rates, contract restructurings and lower parking and lending [ in ] storage results. Partially offsetting these declines were revenues generated by the growth projects and higher system utilization. Boardwalk's operating expenses increased because of the depreciation property taxes and employee-related costs.
  
  Loews Hotels had a terrific third quarter. Its net income contribution was $11 million, up from $4 million in Q3 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose nearly 17% from last year's third quarter to $49 million. Loews Miami Beach and Coronado were the main drivers of the improved performance. Continued earnings growth generated by the Universal Orlando joint venture was masked by costs associated with the opening of the 600-room Aventura Hotel during the third quarter.
  
  Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $5 million, down $43 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by lower returns on equities and alternatives. The corporate tax rate differential between the 2 years benefited the year-over-year after-tax comparison.
  
  Corporate and other was consistent with the prior year on a pretax basis. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate in Q3 2018.
  
  During Q3 2018, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk.

285930,586898850,1597278,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2018",2018-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary.

While good quarterly results are always welcome, a",630,"Thank you, Mary. Today, I'd like to talk briefly about 2 things, CNA and share repurchases. CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results and more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome, at Loews, we understand that there are a number of factors that can positively or negatively impact earnings. And for that reason, we focus on making decisions and running businesses for the long term, and we continue to see positive outcomes from some of the decisions made over the past decade at CNA.
 
 CNA has worked hard to strengthen its underwriting talent, improve its technology infrastructure and expand its distribution network, all while maintaining its fortress balance sheet. CNA has also actively managed the risks from its runoff, long-term care segment.
 
 On their earnings call earlier this morning, the company's CEO, Dino Robusto; and CFO, James Anderson, walked shareholders through additional details about their long-term care book of business. CNA's proactive management of this business, together with its reserve unlocking at year-end 2015, has led to several years of stable results. And at Loews, we feel great about how they've handled it.
 
 Let me hit some of the highlights that Dino and James talked about. First, the long-term care business is a closed book of business that's in runoff mode. CNA has not written a new individual long-term care policy since 2003. And since 2015, the number of individual policyholders has decreased by 15%. Also, around 2003, CNA stopped accepting new group long-term care policies. The active lives in these group policies have declined 29% since the end of 2015. Additionally, CNA's long-term care book of business is mature. The company has processed more than 100,000 claims, which have yielded solid data that CNA is using to model reserves for the segment going forward.
 
 We are confident that CNA's long-term care reserves are built on prudent assumptions. For example, CNA's reserves assume only rate increases that CNA has already filed but have not yet been approved or rate increases that the company plans to file in the near future as part of a current rate increase program. Beyond that, no other rate increases are assumed.
 
 At Loews, we're very interested in CNA's long-term care book of business and their active management of it. We engage with CNA regularly about the company's strategic direction for the long-term care segment as well as its reserves. And we feel confident that CNA is adequately reserved and is managing the business appropriately.
 
 And if you need more proof of how we feel about CNA, look no further than our share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2014, we have purchased about 74 million shares of Loews stock at a total cost of $3.2 billion, fully cognizant of CNA's long-term care exposure. As our largest subsidiary, CNA makes up a significant portion of the value of each Loews common share, so our buybacks underscore the confidence we feel in our insurance subsidiary's long-term value-creation power. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.5% of our outstanding common stock or more than 18 million shares at a total cost of about $920 million.
 
 As long-term listeners to this call know, at Lowes, we don't have an automatic share repurchase program, buying shares no matter what. We are very sensitive to the price we pay for anything, especially our shares. When we can repurchase Loews shares at below our view of their intrinsic value, we feel that's a great use of our cash. Share buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to invest in our business while also rewarding long-term holders of the stock. Rather than complain about the prices of Loews and CNA, we recognize the gift that the markets are giving us, and we buy our shares.
 
 Over to you, David."
285930,586898850,1597278,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2018",2018-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter. Our EPS comparison benefited from share repurchase activity over t",1065,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter. Our EPS comparison benefited from share repurchase activity over the past 12 months.
 
 Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers.
 
 A quick summary of the quarter. CNA accounted for the bulk of our year-over-year net income improvement as lower catastrophe losses and continued strong underlying -- underwriting income drove the results. Boardwalk and Loews Hotels also posted favorable year-over-year contributions. Offsetting these increases were lower contributions from Diamond Offshore and the parent company investment portfolio. As in Q1 and Q2, the lower corporate tax rate benefited our year-over-year after-tax results.
 
 Now for more detail. CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $300 million, up $170 million from Q3 2017. P&C underwriting income drove the increase. CNA's third quarter combined ratio improved almost 10 points from 103.7 in 2017 to 94.2 in 2018, translating into a $161 million increase in pretax P&C underwriting income at CNA. Lower catastrophe losses at CNA drove the year-over-year underwriting improvement. In 2017, CNA had pretax catastrophe losses of $269 million or 16.5 points versus only $46 million or 2.6 points in this year's third quarter. Catastrophe losses reduced Loews' third quarter net income by $32 million this year versus $170 million last year.
 
 CNA booked favorable prior year development in both Q3 2018 and Q3 2017, although the amount of favorable development was less this year than last, partially offsetting the earnings impact of the substantially lower catastrophe losses.
 
 CNA's underlying combined ratio of 94.8, which excludes cats and prior year development, was essentially in line with last year's third quarter. Other factors favorably impacting CNA's year-over-year comparison were higher after-tax net investment income; the absence this year of last year's loss on the early redemption of debt; and higher income in the Life & Group segment, which includes long-term care.
 
 CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly earnings presentation, which can be found on its IR website. Please note that CNA completed its long-term care reserve review in Q3 and intends to shift its reserve review to the third quarter going forward.
 
 The company's GAAP LTC reserves, which totaled just under $12 billion, are split approximately 77-23 between reserves for future policy benefits, also known as active life reserves, and claims reserves. This year's review resulted in a modest favorable release from its claims reserve and no unlocking of its active life reserves.
 
 Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $27 million in Q3 2018 as compared to net income of $6 million last year, reflecting their continued decline in drilling activity and average day rate for Diamond's fleet. Contract drilling revenues declined 21% versus only a 5% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down as the company experienced contract expirations as well as rigs rolling to lower day rates. Unusual items affected Diamond's earnings in both years' third quarters. Diamond's 2018 contribution was reduced by $8 million because of a legal settlement. Last year, a loss on the early retirement of debt reduced our earnings by $11 million.
 
 Diamond continues to focus on ensuring it has ample liquidity during this extended market trough. At the beginning of October, Diamond executed a new 5-year $950 million revolving credit facility. The new revolver is in addition to Diamond's existing revolver, which was reduced to $325 million, $100 million of which matures in 2019 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2020. Currently, both of the facilities remain undrawn.
 
 Boardwalk contributed $28 million to our net income, up from $17 million last year. The year-over-year comparison was affected by Loews' 100% ownership of Boardwalk in Q3 2018 versus 51% last year. Had Loews owned 100% of Boardwalk in last year's third quarter, net income contribution would have declined year-over-year even with the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The decline in profitability stemmed from margin compression, which caused Boardwalk's pretax income to drop from $69 million to $38 million in Q3 2018. The company experienced a $17 million decrease in net operating revenues, a $12 million increase in operating expenses and a slight increase in interest expense. The revenue decline was driven by contract expirations, contract renewals at lower rates, contract restructurings and lower parking and lending [ in ] storage results. Partially offsetting these declines were revenues generated by the growth projects and higher system utilization. Boardwalk's operating expenses increased because of the depreciation property taxes and employee-related costs.
 
 Loews Hotels had a terrific third quarter. Its net income contribution was $11 million, up from $4 million in Q3 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose nearly 17% from last year's third quarter to $49 million. Loews Miami Beach and Coronado were the main drivers of the improved performance. Continued earnings growth generated by the Universal Orlando joint venture was masked by costs associated with the opening of the 600-room Aventura Hotel during the third quarter.
 
 Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $5 million, down $43 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by lower returns on equities and alternatives. The corporate tax rate differential between the 2 years benefited the year-over-year after-tax comparison.
 
 Corporate and other was consistent with the prior year on a pretax basis. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate in Q3 2018.
 
 During Q3 2018, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk. We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $88 million. We purchased an additional 1 million shares since quarter end for approximately $47 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased 18.4 million shares during 2018 for about $923 million, representing 5.5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2017.
 
 Loews ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. As I stated last quarter, we are rebalancing our invested assets in light of the cash used to acquire the Boardwalk units. At quarter end, cash and equivalents accounted for over 60% of the parent company portfolio.
 
 Let me now turn it back to Mary."
