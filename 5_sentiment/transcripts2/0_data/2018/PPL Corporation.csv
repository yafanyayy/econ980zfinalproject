Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2017 results and a look at 2018 and beyond in light of U.S. Tax Reform. I'll discuss the strength of our dividend and our commitment to dividend growth. I will also provide an update on the U.K. regulatory environment. Vince will then review our 2017 segment earnings results and provide a more detailed financial overview of our updated financial outlook. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
On Slide 4, very briefly, I'd like to start with the state of our business in light of U.S. Tax Reform. Tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rates. The credit impacts of Tax Reform on PPL were more than we expecting, given the enacted tax rate of 21% compared to our expectation of 25%. We've taken steps to mitigate the impact of the lower corporate tax rate on earnings and our cash flows. In short, we've added an additional equity plan -- to our plan in 2018, we've increased our cash distributions from the U.K., and we're utilizing the excess value in our foreign currency hedges in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we move through the presentation this morning.
While there've been a number of changes with respect to our business plan, there are a number of items that actually have not changed. We still expect to grow earnings per share by 5% to 6% through 2020 off of our new 2018 [ based ] year. Our updated plan reflects higher projected 2020 earnings per share compared to our previous estimate, despite the effects of tax reform. 
We're committed to continue dividend growth and today, we announced the 4% increase in the dividend, consistent with our prior expectations. We are intent on maintaining solid credit ratings as well. We maintained this significant level of capital investments that also drives our long-term value. And we strive for operational performance, excellence each day. And we will deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. 
The state of our business remains strong, even as we've addressed the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced that we achieved the high end of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range for $2.25 per share. This was the eighth consecutive year that PPL exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast, which highlights the operational excellence of our pure-play regulated utilities. The $0.07 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance of $2.18 per share was due to lower O&M expenses in the U.S. and U.K. and favorable weather in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2018. We've updated our business plan to reflect the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform and our mitigation actions and have announced our formal 2018 guidance range of $2.20 a share to $2.40 per share with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2017 actual ongoing earnings to the 2018 midpoint later during his remarks. But in summary, despite tax reform, our 2018 midpoint is $0.05 higher than our very strong 2017 results. 
Looking longer term, our objective with this updated business plan is to continue to provide 5% to 6% earnings per share growth through 2020 while improving our credit metrics. We've established the 2018 midpoint as the new baseline for the 5% to 6% growth to coincide with the effective date of tax reform. As expected, the largest adverse effect of U.S. Tax Reform was on our projected credit metrics, with FFO to debt dropping into the low 12% range over the plan period prior to any mitigation effects.
In order to support our current ratings with S&P and Moody's, we're targeting to get back to an FFO-to-debt ratio of [ 13% ] by the end of 2019. We've taken several steps laying the groundwork to achieve this goal. First, we are utilizing the excess hedge value in 2018 through 2020 to mitigate the near-term tax impact to earnings and cash flow by letting our current hedges settle in their respective years. We feel comfortable with this revised strategy, given the strength of where the pound is trading against the dollar today. Secondly, we plan to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018 compared to our prior guidance for equity issuances of [ $350 million ] per year. Our additional equity needs beyond 2018 will be dependent upon the performance of our businesses, foreign currency and regulatory outcomes. Currently, we expect to issue between $500 million and $1 billion of equity in 2019 and 2020 with very minimal equity needs beyond 2020. We will work to minimize the amount of additional equity needed in 2019 and 2020. Even at the high end of the equity range, we are confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings growth through 2020. And at the low end of the range, we would actually exceed our EPS growth of 5% to 6% guidance through 2020. 
Turning to the dividend. I want to reiterate that our dividend is secure, and we remain committed to dividend growth. In every quarter since 1946, we have paid a dividend to our shareowners, and PPL's dividend continues to be an important piece of our overall shareowner return. This year is no exception. We announced the 4% dividend increase for 2018 with an annualized rate of $1.64 per share. I should point out that given our yield is significantly above our peer average, we will continue to monitor this as we consider the growth rate moving forward. We believe that disconnect between our yield and that of our peers is temporary, driven by the current political and regulatory uncertainty that exists in the U.K. I want to reiterate our position on the U.K. regulatory model, in that, it remains a premium jurisdiction.
Vince and I, along with Robert Symons, recently had a very constructive meeting with the most senior members of Ofgem, the regulator in the U.K. Following that meeting, we feel even more confident that WPD is well positioned for long-term success under the RIIO regulatory framework and that the mid-period review will not be a material event for WPD or for PPL. I'll talk more about my thoughts on the U.K. in a few minutes. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 where we outline some of our significant accomplishments in 2017. In addition to our strong financial results, from an operational standpoint, we continue to invest in the future, successfully executing on $3.5 billion work of infrastructure improvements. These investments continue to make our U.S. and U.K. networks smarter, more reliable, more sustainable and more resilient. In Pennsylvania, we installed about [ 600,000 advanced meters, ] completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of our [ $160 million ] Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project and added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to enhance distribution automation and strengthen grid resilience and reliability.
In Kentucky, we completed a 20-year 540 mile gas main replacement project in the Louisville area and made significant progress of more than $800 million environmental upgrades as part of a 10-year project to cap and close [ ashponds ] at our coal-fired power plants. 
And in the U.K., we continue to make progress on our asset replacement and fault-management plans as well as advancing nearly 2 dozen low-carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of renewable energy resources. As we executed these investment plans, we remain focused on continuous improvement and value for our customers. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. PPL Electric Utilities also achieved the lowest OSHA Recordable Injury Rate as well as the highest customer satisfaction rate in our company's history. 
The company finished the year near the top [indiscernible] file of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. 
In 2017, our Pennsylvania customers experienced [ 550,000 ] fewer power outages than they did just 10 years ago.
In Kentucky, LG&E and KU achieved the company's lowest OSHA Recordable Injury Rate in their history, finishing among the best in a group of comparable utilities nationwide, while also improving reliability for our customers. In 2017, LG&E and KU also had their best performance for customer reliability in more than a decade. Since 2010, our Kentucky Utilities have reduced both the frequency and duration of customer outages by 35% and 34%, respectively. 
On the generation side of the business, the utilities achieved their lowest combined annual forced outage rate since 2004, once again, putting us in the top quartile of our peers' forced outage metric for the year. And in the U.K., WPD remains on track to achieve its 2017, 2018 performance incentive targets, which include reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, with its 4 distribution network operators maintaining the top 4 spots for customer satisfaction among all the U.K. P&Ls. This is a testament that the capital dollars we are spending across all 3 of our business lines are providing real value for customers. 
Also, in 2017, LG&E and KU received Kentucky Public Service Commission approval for a combined rate increase of [ $116 million, ] with new rates taking effect July 1 of last year.
As we executed on our business plans in 2017, we also remained committed to transparency and sustainability. In November, PPL released the details of a scenario-based climate assessment report, examining the potential impact of climate policies on PPL, consistent with a shareowner request for increased disclosure. In December, we issued our completed Edison Electric Institute environmental, social and governance reporting template. PPL was one of a number of EEI member companies that helped to develop the template to provide investors a condensed, consistent look at sustainability metrics across our sector. In January of year, we announced a new goal to cut the company's carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2010 levels by the year [2050. ] We expect to achieve these reductions by economically replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, improving our energy efficiency, reducing substation greenhouse gas emissions and cutting vehicle fleet emissions. We also announced our intent to respond to CDP's Annual Climate Survey. 
In summary, once again in 2017, we demonstrated strong execution across our U.S. and U.K. businesses, as we positioned the company for continued growth and success.
Turning to Slide 7. I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on off-chance public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the Transmission and Gas Distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns for regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.
However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree the sector, in general, will see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO.
From our side, we communicated to Ofgem, the concerns that we've been hearing directly from our investors about the uncertainty of the U.K. regulation and the impact it's having on investor confidence. We are also aware that some of our investors are actively engaging with Ofgem and expressing their views and concerns to them directly. I would encourage you to continue at that direct engagement and to respond to the formal consultation processes as we have done for the mid-period review and plan to do on the RIIO-2 consultation.
As many of you know, the consultation process is underway to determine if a mid-period review for ED 1 is required, with a decision expected in the spring of 2018. Ofgem knows that the MPR mechanism was intended to be very limited in scope and that they have not identified any issues that meet the original scope definition. Given that fact, we firmly believe that at MPR, with an extension of scope, would ultimately lead to increased cost for customers, as regulatory uncertainty will likely drive higher equity risk premiums and higher financing costs. We have made that clear to Ofgem on behalf of our shareowners and other stakeholders in our formal consultation response, and they acknowledged that they have heard the same message from many others as well. Based on everything we are aware of to date, we do not expect the MPR to have a material impact on our future results. 
Regarding RIIO-ED2, we believe it's far too early to predict any outcomes, as the rules have not yet been developed by Ofgem. However, with Ofgem's statements that the best-performing company should still be able to earn double-digit returns and that they want to drive more differentiation between the best and worst-performing DNOs, we believe WPD is very well positioned to succeed in that type of regulatory construct in RIIO-ED2.
Ofgem expects to consult with stakeholders in early 2018 on the proposed structure for the broader RIIO-2 framework. 
WPD and PPL will have an opportunity to share their views with Ofgem during this phase, similar to prior price control reviews.
Finally, I would like to add that we still have 5 years before the next rate period takes effect, which begins in April of 2023. We've been very successful in the past at navigating through new price control and mitigating earnings impacts. As we move forward, we will work constructively with Ofgem to continue to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns to our shareowners. In addition, we will keep investors informed of the ongoing regulatory processes and provide greater visibility into U.K. regulation and financial results. In fact, we are providing expanded disclosures on the U.K. regulated section -- segment, rather, in the business section of our 10-K that will be filed later today. 
Moving to Slide 8, we've updated the slide to reflect our base rate -- our I'm sorry, our rate base and earnings growth, posttax reform. We expect U.S. rate base to be higher relative to our prior plan due to the lower tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. We now project our combined regulated rate base to grow by 6.4% through 2020, increasing to $31 billion. We continue to expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $10 billion in infrastructure investment we plan to make during that period, which supports our 5% to 6% EPS growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Windsor for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"
185508,550446812,1398549,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earn",2029,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.
Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earnings were $1.64 per share compared to $2.79 per share a year ago. Lower reported earnings for the quarter and the year reflect a current year noncash loss of $321 million or $0.47 per share due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform legislation enacted in December of 2017. This loss was driven by a reduction to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforward of about $120 million and pension and other compensation related liabilities of about $90 million to reflect the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, we established a valuation allowance of about $100 million related to foreign tax credits associated with the transition from a worldwide to a territorial approach to taxing foreign earnings. 
Adjusting for special items, including the effect of tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were [ $0.55 ] per share compared with $0.60 per share a year ago. The $0.05 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11, primarily due to higher income taxes due to a benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits and lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The lower U.K. results were partially offset by higher domestic gross margin in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky and lower operation and maintenance expense in Pennsylvania. 
Moving to the bottom table. Full year earnings from ongoing operations were at $2.25 per share, placing us at the top of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range compared with $2.45 per share for 2016.
I'll cover the year-over-year segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment. But first, let me just highlight the impact of weather for the quarter and the year.
For the quarter, we experienced [ a penny ] of favorable domestic weather compared to the prior year and compared to budget, mostly from Kentucky. And for the year, domestic weather negatively impacted our results by $0.04 compared to the prior year and $0.03 compared to [budget. ] 
In the U.K., for the year, weather was flat compared to '16 and favorable by $0.02 compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the full year segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2017, a $0.01 increase over 2016 results. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from additional transmission capital investment and lower operation and maintenance expense, which was partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions, higher financing cost and higher income taxes and other. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.57 per share in 2017, a $0.01 decrease from 2016. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher gross margins from higher base electricity  and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017, of about $0.05, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of negative $0.03 and higher depreciation expense due to asset addition. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.28 per share in 2017, a $0.21 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower year-over-year results were primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.27, which we were expecting; increased depreciation expense from asset addition; and higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt. This was partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by the April 1, 2006 price -- 2016 price increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily from higher pension income and lower income taxes primarily due to lower U.K. income taxes and the 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions, partially offset by a U.S. tax benefit recorded in 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Moving to Slide 15 and a more detailed review of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. As Bill mentioned, U.S. Tax Reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rate. The final legislation included many of the provisions we and other electric utilities advocated for, including the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities paid for by foregoing bonus depreciation. However, Tax Reform does negatively impacted earnings and credit due to lower tax yield on holding company interest expense and reduced cash flows at our domestic utility, as we passed through to customers the lower cost of federal income taxes. And since PPL is not a current federal taxpayer, we will see no immediate corporate cash benefit from the reduced tax rate.
The net result in our credit metrics was a reduction in our FFO-to-debt metrics into the low 12% range over the planning period, which pressures our current credit rating. Therefore, in response, we expect to settle the foreign currency hedges over the next few years to help mitigate near-term earnings and cash flow impact, and we now plan to increase our equity issuances in 2018. 
In terms of the U.K. segment, tax reform shift to a territorial tax system for foreign entities is not expected to have a material impact on PPL. We were able to successfully mitigate the legislation's onetime incremental tax on accumulated foreign earnings with existing net operating losses and foreign tax credits. In addition, the fact that U.S. parent corporations will generally no longer be subject to an incremental U.S. tax on cash repatriation, this provides us with greater flexibility, long term, to repatriate cash from the U.K. 
As referred to in earlier remarks, we've increased the projected amount of cash for repatriation from the U.K. to pre-requisite levels of between $300 million and $500 million per year compared to our prior plan of $100 million to $200 million a year, which also results in a corresponding shift in borrowing from the U.S. to the U.K. segment.
While there is no -- while there is now greater long-term flexibly with regards to repatriation, this decision was primarily driven by the change in the U.S. tax rate and the strengthening of the pound. Overall, the impact of U.S. Tax Reform was a net benefit to our federal cash tax-paying status, as we don't expect to be a federal cash taxpayer now until 2022 or 2023. 
Lastly, on the regulatory front, on January 29, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the KPSE, to commence returning savings related to tax reform to their customers. In Pennsylvania, the PUC requested comments regarding the impacts of tax reform on customer rates last week. We are preparing our responses to this request and we'll wait for formal guidance from the commission. At this point, we have not received formal guidance from them. We will continue to work closely with the applicable regulatory bodies to a corporately reflect and corporate the impact of federal tax reform in our rate.
Turning to a discussion of our updated plan. On Slide 16, we show a walk from our 2017 actual ongoing earning of $2.25 per share to the midpoint of our 2018 forecast prior to tax reform of $2.33 per share. We then continue to walk, reflecting the impacts of tax reform and then that our current 2018 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.30 per share. In summary, our 2018 midpoint is still $0.05 per share higher than our strong 2017 results despite the effects of tax reform. Looking at the detailed operational drivers on the left-hand side of the slide, our U.K. segment is expected to deliver higher earnings of $0.08 compared to 2017, primarily resulting from a higher foreign currency exchange rate and higher pension income, primarily due to continued pension funding required by our pension trustees. Partially offset by higher taxes, primarily the result of $0.11 of tax benefit recorded in 2017 that are not expected to reach repeat in 2018. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we're projecting higher margins of $0.12, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. In terms of our Kentucky margins, the positive projection includes a full year's work of rate [ case ] benefit along with the assumption back-to-normal weather. 
Our pretax reform plan included equity issuances of [ $350 million ] per year, which results in about $0.05 of dilution for 2018 compared to 2017. 
Moving to the effects of tax reform on the right-hand side of the slide. As expected, earnings were impacted by about $0.06 from the lower tax [ yield ] on holding company interest expense. However, this was more than offset by higher earning on higher domestic rate base, higher foreign currency rates, as we shifted our hedge strategy to let the excess hedge values flow through each year, effectively eliminating the restrike strategy that we were deploying prior to Tax Reform and other factors. Finally, we see about $0.05 of incremental dilution from the additional [ $650 million ] of equity relative to our prior assumption, net of the benefits from lower debt financing.
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $15 billion over the period. Our revised capital plan [ increased ] by about $180 million compared to the prior plan, primarily driven by an increase in Pennsylvania distribution spending to maximize reliability. This incremental distribution capital should be subject to recovery under the [ disk ] mechanism and is consistent with our most recently approved [indiscernible] filing. We also slightly increased our reliability-based capital spending in 2018 through '21 in Kentucky, while shifting some of our environmental spending out to later years.
We currently project our capital investments to be slightly lower in the back end of the plan compared to current levels due to the completion of advanced metering projects in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which is consistent with prior capital plans. We also reflect lower transmission spend in Pennsylvania in '21 and '22, as we only include identified projects in our capital plan. There could be further capital spending opportunities, as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. I'll also point out that this 5-year capital plan does not include project [compass. ] 
And finally, moving to Slide 18 for a foreign currency update. Post tax reform, we have updated our hedge portfolio to incorporate the lower tax rate of 21%, down from 35%. We are now 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average of $1.34 per pound and 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39. And since the third quarter call, we've continued to layer on additional hedges for 2020 and are now 35% hedged at an average rate of [$1.46. ] 
To help us at the earnings and credit impacts from tax reform, we expect to let our current hedges settle in their respective years without significant additional restrikes going forward. The restrike strategy served its purpose to provide some stability and flexibility, as the pound was under a lot of pressure immediately following the Brexit poll in 2016. Looking forward and given the strength of the pound, we would expect to hedge more in line with the ranges established by our risk management framework on a rolling 36-month basis. As a reminder, we target 70 to 100% hedged in year 1, 30% to 70% hedged in year 2 and 0% to 30% hedged in year 3. 
As I mentioned, we've increased our budgeted rate on 2020 open positions to be more reflective of current market rates. However, this remains a conservative assumption, as the current average forward rate for 2020 is well above $1.40.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

First, we believe we have a solid, low-risk organic growth plan that we can deliver on. Delivering on this plan, in fact, has been our strategic focus since the spin-off of our competitive generation business. And that focus has not changed. Our intention is squarely on delivering long-term earnings growth, on strengthening our balance sheet and on reaching a positive resolution on the mid-period review in the U.K., all of which we are making progress towards.
We believe PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. Nothing we see on the horizon change that view.

But one of the reasons we gave you a range for the equity issuances of -- for '19 and '20 of [ 500 to a billion ], $500 million to $1 billion was the fact that we have delivered in excess of the midpoint. So taking that into account as well as some of the other moving parts, for example, we don't have the regulatory outcomes yet in Pennsylvania nor at FERC. We think that there is some upside there, not only just in delivering, but that $500 million is probably achievable in terms of the equity in '19 and '20 if things fall in places as they could. So again, kind of being conservative.

But I don't think the fundamentals of the business, overall have changed much, because everyone's pretty much on the same level playing field. Now having said that, for PPL specifically, because 50% of our business is in the U.K., and 50% here -- is here, as interest rates rise in the U.S, we've got somewhat of a hedge against rising interest rates here vis-à-vis the U.K. So that to the extent that the U.K. interest rates remain much lower than they are here in the U.S, that could be a positive to the stock. And I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change from the PPL perspective in our view of M&A. So what we have said in the past is that we can be successful with the organic growth plan that we have. We don't need M&A to be successful.

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2017 results and a look at 2018 and beyond in light of U.S. tax reform. I'll discuss the strength of our dividend and our commitment to dividend growth. I will also provide an update on the U.K. regulatory environment. Vince will then review our 2017 segment earning results and provide a more detailed financial overview of our updated financial outlook. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
On Slide 4, very briefly, I'd like to start with the state of our business in light of U.S. tax reform. Tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rates. The credit impacts of tax reform on PPL were more than we were expecting, given the enacted tax rate of 21% compared to our expectation of 25%. We've taken steps to mitigate the impact of the lower corporate tax rate on earnings and our cash flows. In short, we've added an additional equity to our plan in 2018, we've increased our cash distributions from the U.K., and we're utilizing the excess value in our foreign currency hedges in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we move through the presentation this morning.
While there've been a number of changes with respect to our business plan, there are a number of items that actually have not changed. We still expect to grow earnings per share by 5% to 6% through 2020 off of our new 2018 base year. Our updated plan reflects higher projected 2020 earnings per share compared to our previous estimate, despite the effects of tax reform. 
We're committed to continue dividend growth and today, we announced the 4% increase in the dividend, consistent with our prior expectations. We are intent on maintaining solid credit ratings as well. We maintain the significant level of capital investment that also drives our long-term value. And we strive for operational performance, excellence each day. And we will deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. 
The state of our business remains strong, even as we've addressed the impacts of U.S. tax reform.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced that we achieved the high end of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range or $2.25 per share. This was the eighth consecutive year that PPL exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast, which highlights the operational excellence of our pure-play regulated utilities. The $0.07 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance of $2.18 per share was due to lower O&M expenses in the U.S. and U.K. and favorable weather in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2018. We've updated our business plan to reflect the impacts of U.S. tax reform and our mitigation actions and have announced our formal 2018 guidance range of $2.20 a share to $2.40 per share with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2017 actual ongoing earnings to the 2018 midpoint later during his remarks. But in summary, despite tax reform, our 2018 midpoint is $0.05 higher than our very strong 2017 results. 
Looking longer term, our objective with this updated business plan is to continue to provide 5% to 6% earnings per share growth through 2020 while improving our credit metrics. We've established the 2018 midpoint as the new baseline for the 5% to 6% growth to coincide with the effective date of tax reform. As expected, the largest adverse effect of U.S. tax reform was on our projected credit metrics, with FFO to debt dropping into the low 12% range over the plan period prior to any mitigation effects.
In order to support our current ratings with S&P and Moody's, we're targeting to get back to an FFO to debt ratio of 13% by the end of 2019. We've taken several steps laying the groundwork to achieve this goal. First, we are utilizing the excess hedge value in 2018 through 2020 to mitigate the near-term tax impact to earnings and cash flow by letting our current hedges settle in their respective years. We feel comfortable with this revised strategy, given the strength of where the pound is trading against the dollar today. Secondly, we plan to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018 compared to our prior guidance for equity issuances of $350 million per year. Our additional equity needs beyond 2018 will be dependent upon the performance of our businesses, foreign currency and regulatory outcomes. Currently, we expect to issue between $500 million and $1 billion of equity in 2019 and 2020 with very minimal equity needs beyond 2020. We will work to minimize the amount of additional equity needed in 2019 and 2020. Even at the high end of the equity range, we are confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings growth through 2020. And at the low end of the range, we would actually exceed our EPS growth of 5% to 6% guidance through 2020. 
Turning to the dividend. I want to reiterate that our dividend is secure, and we remain committed to dividend growth. In every quarter since 1946, we have paid a dividend to our shareowners, and PPL's dividend continues to be an important piece of our overall shareowner return. This year is no exception. We announced the 4% dividend increase for 2018 with an annualized rate of $1.64 per share. I should point out that given our yield is significantly above our peer average, we will continue to monitor this as we consider the growth rate moving forward. We believe that disconnect between our yield and that of our peers is temporary, driven by the current political and regulatory uncertainty that exists in the U.K. I want to reiterate our position on the U.K. regulatory model, in that, it remains a premium jurisdiction.
Vince and I, along with Robert Symons, recently had a very constructive meeting with the most senior members of Ofgem, the regulator in the U.K. Following that meeting, we feel even more confident that WPD is well positioned for long-term success under the RIIO regulatory framework and that the mid-period review will not be a material event for WPD or for PPL. I'll talk more about my thoughts on the U.K. in a few minutes. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 where we outline some of our significant accomplishments in 2017. In addition to our strong financial results, from an operational standpoint, we continue to invest in the future, successfully executing on $3.5 billion worth of infrastructure improvements. These investments continue to make our U.S. and U.K. networks smarter, more reliable, more sustainable and more resilient. In Pennsylvania, we installed about 600,000 advanced meters, completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of our $160 million Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project and added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to enhance distribution automation and strengthen grid resilience and reliability.
In Kentucky, we completed a 20-year 540 mile gas main replacement project in the Louisville area and made significant progress of more than $800 million in environmental upgrades as part of a 10-year project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants.  
And in the U.K., we continue to make progress on our asset replacement and fault management plans as well as advancing nearly 2 dozen low-carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of renewable energy resources. As we executed these investment plans, we remain focused on continuous improvement and value for our customers. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. PPL Electric Utilities also achieved the lowest OSHA recordable injury rate as well as the highest customer satisfaction rate in our company's history. 
The company finished the year near the top decile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. 
In 2017, our Pennsylvania customers experienced 550,000 fewer power outages than they did just 10 years ago.
In Kentucky, LG&E and KU achieved the company's lowest OSHA recordable injury rate in their history, finishing among the best in a group of comparable utilities nationwide, while also improving reliability for our customers. In 2017, LG&E and KU also had their best performance for customer reliability in more than a decade. Since 2010, our Kentucky Utilities have reduced both the frequency and duration of customer outages by 35% and 34%, respectively.
On the generation side of the business, the utilities achieved their lowest combined annual forced outage rate since 2004, once again, putting us in the top quartile of our peers' forced outage metric for the year. 
And in the U.K., WPD remains on track to achieve its 2017, 2018 performance incentive targets, which include reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, with its 4 distribution network operators maintaining the top 4 spots for customer satisfaction among all the U.K. P&Ls. 
This is a testament that the capital dollars we are spending across all 3 of our business lines are providing real value for customers. 
Also, in 2017, LG&E and KU received Kentucky Public Service Commission approval for a combined rate increase of $116 million with new rates taking effect July 1 of last year.
As we executed on our business plans in 2017, we also remained committed to transparency and sustainability. In November, PPL released the detailed scenario-based climate assessment report, examining the potential impact of climate policies on PPL, consistent with a shareowner request for increased disclosure. In December, we issued our completed Edison Electric Institute environmental, social and governance reporting template. PPL was one of the number of EEI member companies that helped to develop the template to provide investors a condensed, consistent look at sustainability metrics across our sector. In January of this year, we announced a new goal to cut the company's carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2010 levels by the year 2050. We expect to achieve these reductions by economically replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, improving our energy efficiency, reducing substation greenhouse gas emissions and cutting vehicle fleet emissions. We also announced our intent to respond to CDP's annual climate survey. 
In summary, once again in 2017, we demonstrated strong execution across our U.S. and U.K. businesses, as we position the company for continued growth and success.
Turning to Slide 7. I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.  However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree to sector, in general, we'll see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO.  
From our side, we communicated to Ofgem, the concerns we've been hearing directly from our investors about the uncertainty of the U.K. regulation and the impact it's having on investor confidence. We are also aware that some of our investors are actively engaging with Ofgem and expressing their views and concerns to them directly. I would encourage you to continue that direct engagement and to respond to the formal consultation processes as we have done for the mid-period review and plan to do on the RIIO-2 consultation.
As many of you know, the consultation process is underway to determine if a mid-period review for ED1 is required, with a decision expected in the spring of 2018. Ofgem notes that the MPR mechanism was intended to be very limited in scope and that they have not identified any issues that meet the original scope definition. Given that fact, we firmly believe that an MPR, with an extension of scope, would ultimately lead to increased cost for customers, as regulatory uncertainty will likely drive higher equity risk premium and higher financing costs. We have made that clear to Ofgem on behalf of our shareowners and other stakeholders in our formal consultation response, and they acknowledged that they have heard the same message from many others as well. Based on everything we are aware of to date, we do not expect the MPR to have a material impact on our future results. 
Regarding RIIO-ED2, we believe it's far too early to predict any outcomes, as the rules have not yet been developed by Ofgem. However, with Ofgem's statements that the best-performing company should still be able to earn double-digit returns and that they want to drive more differentiation between the best and worst-performing DNOs, we believe WPD is very well positioned to succeed in that type of regulatory construct in RIIO-ED2.
Ofgem expects to consult with stakeholders in early 2018 on the proposed structure for the broader RIIO-2 framework. 
WPD and PPL will have an opportunity to share their views with Ofgem during this phase, similar to prior price control reviews.
Finally, I would like to add that we still have 5 years before the next rate period takes effect, which begins in April of 2023. We've been very successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and mitigating earnings impacts. As we move forward, we will work constructively with Ofgem to continue to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. In addition, we will keep investors informed of the ongoing regulatory processes and provide greater visibility into U.K. regulation and financial results. In fact, we are providing expanded disclosures on the U.K. regulated section -- segment, rather, in the business section of our 10-K that will be filed later today. 
Moving to Slide 8, we've updated this slide to reflect our base rate -- I'm sorry, our rate base and earnings growth, post tax reform. We expect U.S. rate base to be higher relative to our prior plan due to the lower tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. We now project our combined regulated rate base to grow by 6.4% through 2020, increasing to $31 billion. We continue to expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $10 billion in infrastructure investment we plan to make during that period, which supports our 5% to 6% EPS growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earn",2001,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.
Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earnings were $1.64 per share compared to $2.79 per share a year ago. Lower reported earnings for the quarter and the year reflect a current year noncash loss of $321 million or $0.47 per share due to the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December of 2017. This loss was driven by a reduction to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforward of about $120 million and pension and other compensation-related liabilities of about $90 million to reflect the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, we established a valuation allowance of about $100 million related to foreign tax credits associated with the transition from a worldwide to a territorial approach to taxing foreign earnings. 
Adjusting for special items, including the effects of tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.60 per share a year ago. The $0.05 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11, primarily due to higher income taxes due to a benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits and lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The lower U.K. results were partially offset by higher domestic gross margin in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky and lower operation and maintenance expense in Pennsylvania. 
Moving to the bottom table. Full year earnings from ongoing operations were at $2.25 per share, placing us at the top of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range compared with $2.45 per share for 2016.
I'll cover the year-over-year segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment. But first, let me just highlight the impact of weather for the quarter and the year.
For the quarter, we experienced $0.01 of favorable domestic weather compared to the prior year and compared to budget, mostly from Kentucky. And for the year, domestic weather negatively impacted our results by $0.04 compared to the prior year and $0.03 compared to budget.  
In the U.K., for the year, weather was flat compared to '16 and favorable by $0.02 compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the full year segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2017, a $0.01 increase over 2016 results. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from additional transmission capital investment and lower operation and maintenance expense. This was partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions, higher financing cost and higher income taxes and other. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.57 per share in 2017, a $0.01 decrease from 2016. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017, of about $0.05, partially offset by lower sales volumes, due to unfavorable weather of negative $0.03 and higher depreciation expense due to asset addition. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.28 per share in 2017, a $0.21 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower year-over-year results were primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.27, which we were expecting; increased depreciation expense from asset addition; and higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt. This was partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily from higher pension income and lower income taxes primarily due to lower U.K. income taxes and the 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions, partially offset by a U.S. tax benefit recorded in 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Moving to Slide 15 and a more detailed review of the impact of U.S. tax reform. As Bill mentioned, U.S. tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rate. The final legislation included many of the provisions we and other electric utilities advocated for, including the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities paid for by foregoing bonus depreciation. However, tax reform does negatively impact earnings and credit due to lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and reduced cash flows at our domestic utilities, as we pass through to customers the lower cost of federal income taxes. And since PPL is not a current federal taxpayer, we will see no immediate corporate cash benefit from the reduced tax rate.
The net result in our credit metrics was a reduction in our FFO to debt metrics into the low 12% range over the planning period, which pressures our current credit rating. Therefore, in response, we expect to settle the foreign currency hedges over the next few years to help mitigate near-term earnings and cash flow impact, and we now plan to increase our equity issuances in 2018. 
In terms of the U.K. segment, tax reform shift to a territorial tax system for foreign entities is not expected to have a material impact on PPL. We were able to successfully mitigate the legislation's onetime incremental tax on accumulated foreign earnings with existing net operating losses and foreign tax credits. 
In addition, the fact that U.S. parent corporations will generally no longer be subject to an incremental U.S. tax on cash repatriation, this provides us with greater flexibility, long term, to repatriate cash from the U.K. 
As referred to in earlier remarks, we've increased the projected amount of cash repatriation from the U.K. to pre-Brexit levels of between $300 million and $500 million per year compared to our prior plan of $100 million to $200 million a year, which also results in a corresponding shift in borrowing from the U.S. to the U.K. segment.
While there is now greater long-term flexibly with regards to repatriation, this decision was primarily driven by the change in the U.S. tax rate and the strengthening of the pound. Overall, the impact of U.S. tax reform was a net benefit to our federal cash tax-paying status, as we don't expect to be a federal cash taxpayer now until 2022 or 2023. 
Lastly, on the regulatory front, on January 29, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the KPSC, to commence returning savings related to tax reform to their customers. In Pennsylvania, the PUC requested comments regarding the impacts of tax reform on customer rates last week. We are preparing our responses to this request and we'll wait for formal guidance from the commission. At this point, we have not received formal guidance from FERC. We will continue to work closely with the applicable regulatory bodies to a appropriately reflect and incorporate the impact of federal tax reform in our rate.
Turning to a discussion of our updated plan. On Slide 16, we show a walk from our 2017 actual ongoing earning of $2.25 per share to the midpoint of our 2018 forecast prior to tax reform of $2.33 per share. We then continue to walk, reflecting the impacts of tax reform and then that our current 2018 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.30 per share. In summary, our 2018 midpoint is still $0.05 per share higher than our strong 2017 results despite the effects of tax reform. 
Looking at the detailed operational drivers on the left-hand side of the slide, our U.K. segment is expected to deliver higher earnings of $0.08 compared to 2017, primarily resulting from a higher foreign currency exchange rate and higher pension income, primarily due to continued pension funding required by our pension trustees, partially offset by higher taxes, primarily the result of $0.11 of tax benefit recorded in 2017 that are not expected to reach repeat in 2018. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we're projecting higher margins of $0.12, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. In terms of our Kentucky margins, the positive projection includes a full year's worth of rate case benefit along with the assumption back-to-normal weather. 
Our pretax reform plan included equity issuances of $350 million per year, which results in about $0.05 of dilution for 2018 compared to 2017. 
Moving to the effects of tax reform on the right-hand side of the slide. As expected, earnings were impacted by about $0.06 from the lower tax shield on holding company interest expense. However, this was more than offset by higher earning on higher domestic rate base, higher foreign currency rates, as we shifted our hedge strategy to let the excess hedge values flow through each year, effectively eliminating the restrike strategy that we were deploying prior to tax reform and other factors. Finally, we see about $0.05 of incremental dilution from the additional $650 million of equity relative to our prior assumption, net of the benefits from lower debt financing.
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $15 billion over the period. Our revised capital plan increased by about $180 million compared to the prior plan, primarily driven by an increase in Pennsylvania distribution spending to maximize reliability. This incremental distribution capital should be subject to recovery under the disk mechanism and is consistent with our most recently approved LTIP filing. 
We also slightly increased our reliability-based capital spending in 2018 through '21 in Kentucky, while shifting some of our environmental spending out to later years.
We currently project our capital investments to be slightly lower in the back end of the plan compared to current levels due to the completion of advanced metering projects in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which is consistent with prior capital plans. We also reflect lower transmission spend in Pennsylvania in '21 and '22, as we only include identified projects in our capital plan. There could be further capital spending opportunities, as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. I'll also point out that this 5-year capital plan does not include Project Compass.
And finally, moving to Slide 18 for a foreign currency update. Post tax reform, we have updated our hedge portfolio to incorporate the lower tax rate of 21%, down from 35%. We are now 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average of $1.34 per pound and 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39. And since the third quarter call, we've continued to layer on additional hedges for 2020 and are now 35% hedged at an average rate of $1.46.
To help offset the earnings and credit impacts from tax reform, we expect to let our current hedges settle in their respective years without significant additional restrikes going forward. The restrike strategy served its purpose to provide some stability and flexibility, as the pound was under a lot of pressure immediately following the Brexit vote in 2016. Looking forward and given the strength of the pound, we would expect to hedge more in line with the ranges established by our risk management framework on a rolling 36-month basis. As a reminder, we target 70 to 100% hedged in year 1; 30% to 70% hedged in year 2; and 0% to 30% hedged in year 3. 
As I mentioned, we've increased our budgeted rate on 2020 open position to be more reflective of current market rates. However, this remains a conservative assumption, as the current average forward rate for 2020 is well above $1.40.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

We believe PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. Nothing we see on the horizon changes that view. We continue to project, competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend, even post tax reform. We continue to demonstrate an ability to mitigate challenges that affect our business, as we did with Brexit last year and now again, with U.S. tax reform. Our utilities remain among the very best in the regions they serve, and we're continuing to invest responsibly to make the grid smarter, more reliable, more resilient and to advance a cleaner energy future. The bottom line is, we will continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. And we will continue to deliver long-term value to those who invest in PPL.

But one of the reasons we gave you a range for the equity issuances of -- for '19 and '20 of $500 million to $1 billion was the fact that we have delivered in excess of the midpoint. So taking that into account as well as some of the other moving parts, for example, we don't have the regulatory outcomes yet in Pennsylvania nor at FERC. We think that there is some upside there, not only just in delivering, but that $500 million is probably achievable in terms of the equity in '19 and '20 if things fall in places as they could. So again, kind of being conservative.

On the M&A front, I don't really think that tax reform overall is going to have a significant effect within our sector, whether that's in the EU or here in the U.S. I think -- the one effect it could have is, it does remove the uncertainty about what tax reform might have been. So from that perspective, it might create some more opportunity for some. But I don't think the fundamentals of the business, overall, have changed much, because everyone's pretty much on the same level playing field. Now having said that, for PPL specifically, because 50% of our business is in the U.K., and 50% is here, as interest rates rise in the U.S, we've got somewhat of a hedge against rising interest rates here vis-à-vis the U.K. So to the extent that the U.K. interest rates remain much lower than they are here in the U.S, that could be a positive to the stock. And I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change from the PPL perspective in our view of M&A. So what we've said in the past is that we can be successful with the organic growth plan that we have. We don't need M&A to be successful. I think we've been pretty transparent that as we think about M&A, our objective has been to strengthen our EPS growth rate and credit metrics, if you were to engage in M&A.

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2017 results and a look at 2018 and beyond in light of U.S. tax reform. I'll discuss the strength of our dividend and our commitment to dividend growth. I will also provide an update on the U.K. regulatory environment. Vince will then review our 2017 segment earning results and provide a more detailed financial overview of our updated financial outlook. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
On Slide 4, very briefly, I'd like to start with the state of our business in light of U.S. tax reform. Tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rates. The credit impacts of tax reform on PPL were more than we were expecting, given the enacted tax rate of 21% compared to our expectation of 25%. We've taken steps to mitigate the impact of the lower corporate tax rate on earnings and our cash flows. In short, we've added an additional equity to our plan in 2018, we've increased our cash distributions from the U.K., and we're utilizing the excess value in our foreign currency hedges in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we move through the presentation this morning.
While there've been a number of changes with respect to our business plan, there are a number of items that actually have not changed. We still expect to grow earnings per share by 5% to 6% through 2020 off of our new 2018 base year. Our updated plan reflects higher projected 2020 earnings per share compared to our previous estimate, despite the effects of tax reform. 
We're committed to continue dividend growth and today, we announced the 4% increase in the dividend, consistent with our prior expectations. We are intent on maintaining solid credit ratings as well. We maintain the significant level of capital investment that also drives our long-term value. And we strive for operational performance, excellence each day. And we will deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. 
The state of our business remains strong, even as we've addressed the impacts of U.S. tax reform.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced that we achieved the high end of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range or $2.25 per share. This was the eighth consecutive year that PPL exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast, which highlights the operational excellence of our pure-play regulated utilities. The $0.07 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance of $2.18 per share was due to lower O&M expenses in the U.S. and U.K. and favorable weather in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2018. We've updated our business plan to reflect the impacts of U.S. tax reform and our mitigation actions and have announced our formal 2018 guidance range of $2.20 a share to $2.40 per share with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2017 actual ongoing earnings to the 2018 midpoint later during his remarks. But in summary, despite tax reform, our 2018 midpoint is $0.05 higher than our very strong 2017 results. 
Looking longer term, our objective with this updated business plan is to continue to provide 5% to 6% earnings per share growth through 2020 while improving our credit metrics. We've established the 2018 midpoint as the new baseline for the 5% to 6% growth to coincide with the effective date of tax reform. As expected, the largest adverse effect of U.S. tax reform was on our projected credit metrics, with FFO to debt dropping into the low 12% range over the plan period prior to any mitigation effects.
In order to support our current ratings with S&P and Moody's, we're targeting to get back to an FFO to debt ratio of 13% by the end of 2019. We've taken several steps laying the groundwork to achieve this goal. First, we are utilizing the excess hedge value in 2018 through 2020 to mitigate the near-term tax impact to earnings and cash flow by letting our current hedges settle in their respective years. We feel comfortable with this revised strategy, given the strength of where the pound is trading against the dollar today. Secondly, we plan to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018 compared to our prior guidance for equity issuances of $350 million per year. Our additional equity needs beyond 2018 will be dependent upon the performance of our businesses, foreign currency and regulatory outcomes. Currently, we expect to issue between $500 million and $1 billion of equity in 2019 and 2020 with very minimal equity needs beyond 2020. We will work to minimize the amount of additional equity needed in 2019 and 2020. Even at the high end of the equity range, we are confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings growth through 2020. And at the low end of the range, we would actually exceed our EPS growth of 5% to 6% guidance through 2020. 
Turning to the dividend. I want to reiterate that our dividend is secure, and we remain committed to dividend growth. In every quarter since 1946, we have paid a dividend to our shareowners, and PPL's dividend continues to be an important piece of our overall shareowner return. This year is no exception. We announced the 4% dividend increase for 2018 with an annualized rate of $1.64 per share. I should point out that given our yield is significantly above our peer average, we will continue to monitor this as we consider the growth rate moving forward. We believe that disconnect between our yield and that of our peers is temporary, driven by the current political and regulatory uncertainty that exists in the U.K. I want to reiterate our position on the U.K. regulatory model, in that, it remains a premium jurisdiction.
Vince and I, along with Robert Symons, recently had a very constructive meeting with the most senior members of Ofgem, the regulator in the U.K. Following that meeting, we feel even more confident that WPD is well positioned for long-term success under the RIIO regulatory framework and that the mid-period review will not be a material event for WPD or for PPL. I'll talk more about my thoughts on the U.K. in a few minutes. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 where we outline some of our significant accomplishments in 2017. In addition to our strong financial results, from an operational standpoint, we continue to invest in the future, successfully executing on $3.5 billion worth of infrastructure improvements. These investments continue to make our U.S. and U.K. networks smarter, more reliable, more sustainable and more resilient. In Pennsylvania, we installed about 600,000 advanced meters, completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of our $160 million Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project and added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to enhance distribution automation and strengthen grid resilience and reliability.
In Kentucky, we completed a 20-year 540 mile gas main replacement project in the Louisville area and made significant progress of more than $800 million in environmental upgrades as part of a 10-year project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants.  
And in the U.K., we continue to make progress on our asset replacement and fault management plans as well as advancing nearly 2 dozen low-carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of renewable energy resources. As we executed these investment plans, we remain focused on continuous improvement and value for our customers. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. PPL Electric Utilities also achieved the lowest OSHA recordable injury rate as well as the highest customer satisfaction rate in our company's history. 
The company finished the year near the top decile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. 
In 2017, our Pennsylvania customers experienced 550,000 fewer power outages than they did just 10 years ago.
In Kentucky, LG&E and KU achieved the company's lowest OSHA recordable injury rate in their history, finishing among the best in a group of comparable utilities nationwide, while also improving reliability for our customers. In 2017, LG&E and KU also had their best performance for customer reliability in more than a decade. Since 2010, our Kentucky Utilities have reduced both the frequency and duration of customer outages by 35% and 34%, respectively.
On the generation side of the business, the utilities achieved their lowest combined annual forced outage rate since 2004, once again, putting us in the top quartile of our peers' forced outage metric for the year. 
And in the U.K., WPD remains on track to achieve its 2017, 2018 performance incentive targets, which include reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, with its 4 distribution network operators maintaining the top 4 spots for customer satisfaction among all the U.K. P&Ls. 
This is a testament that the capital dollars we are spending across all 3 of our business lines are providing real value for customers. 
Also, in 2017, LG&E and KU received Kentucky Public Service Commission approval for a combined rate increase of $116 million with new rates taking effect July 1 of last year.
As we executed on our business plans in 2017, we also remained committed to transparency and sustainability. In November, PPL released the detailed scenario-based climate assessment report, examining the potential impact of climate policies on PPL, consistent with a shareowner request for increased disclosure. In December, we issued our completed Edison Electric Institute environmental, social and governance reporting template. PPL was one of the number of EEI member companies that helped to develop the template to provide investors a condensed, consistent look at sustainability metrics across our sector. In January of this year, we announced a new goal to cut the company's carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2010 levels by the year 2050. We expect to achieve these reductions by economically replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, improving our energy efficiency, reducing substation greenhouse gas emissions and cutting vehicle fleet emissions. We also announced our intent to respond to CDP's annual climate survey. 
In summary, once again in 2017, we demonstrated strong execution across our U.S. and U.K. businesses, as we position the company for continued growth and success.
Turning to Slide 7. I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.  However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree to sector, in general, we'll see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO.  
From our side, we communicated to Ofgem, the concerns we've been hearing directly from our investors about the uncertainty of the U.K. regulation and the impact it's having on investor confidence. We are also aware that some of our investors are actively engaging with Ofgem and expressing their views and concerns to them directly. I would encourage you to continue that direct engagement and to respond to the formal consultation processes as we have done for the mid-period review and plan to do on the RIIO-2 consultation.
As many of you know, the consultation process is underway to determine if a mid-period review for ED1 is required, with a decision expected in the spring of 2018. Ofgem notes that the MPR mechanism was intended to be very limited in scope and that they have not identified any issues that meet the original scope definition. Given that fact, we firmly believe that an MPR, with an extension of scope, would ultimately lead to increased cost for customers, as regulatory uncertainty will likely drive higher equity risk premium and higher financing costs. We have made that clear to Ofgem on behalf of our shareowners and other stakeholders in our formal consultation response, and they acknowledged that they have heard the same message from many others as well. Based on everything we are aware of to date, we do not expect the MPR to have a material impact on our future results. 
Regarding RIIO-ED2, we believe it's far too early to predict any outcomes, as the rules have not yet been developed by Ofgem. However, with Ofgem's statements that the best-performing company should still be able to earn double-digit returns and that they want to drive more differentiation between the best and worst-performing DNOs, we believe WPD is very well positioned to succeed in that type of regulatory construct in RIIO-ED2.
Ofgem expects to consult with stakeholders in early 2018 on the proposed structure for the broader RIIO-2 framework. 
WPD and PPL will have an opportunity to share their views with Ofgem during this phase, similar to prior price control reviews.
Finally, I would like to add that we still have 5 years before the next rate period takes effect, which begins in April of 2023. We've been very successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and mitigating earnings impacts. As we move forward, we will work constructively with Ofgem to continue to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. In addition, we will keep investors informed of the ongoing regulatory processes and provide greater visibility into U.K. regulation and financial results. In fact, we are providing expanded disclosures on the U.K. regulated section -- segment, rather, in the business section of our 10-K that will be filed later today. 
Moving to Slide 8, we've updated this slide to reflect our base rate -- I'm sorry, our rate base and earnings growth, post tax reform. We expect U.S. rate base to be higher relative to our prior plan due to the lower tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. We now project our combined regulated rate base to grow by 6.4% through 2020, increasing to $31 billion. We continue to expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $10 billion in infrastructure investment we plan to make during that period, which supports our 5% to 6% EPS growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earn",2001,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.
Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earnings were $1.64 per share compared to $2.79 per share a year ago. Lower reported earnings for the quarter and the year reflect a current year noncash loss of $321 million or $0.47 per share due to the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December of 2017. This loss was driven by a reduction to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforward of about $120 million and pension and other compensation-related liabilities of about $90 million to reflect the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, we established a valuation allowance of about $100 million related to foreign tax credits associated with the transition from a worldwide to a territorial approach to taxing foreign earnings. 
Adjusting for special items, including the effects of tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.60 per share a year ago. The $0.05 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11, primarily due to higher income taxes due to a benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits and lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The lower U.K. results were partially offset by higher domestic gross margin in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky and lower operation and maintenance expense in Pennsylvania. 
Moving to the bottom table. Full year earnings from ongoing operations were at $2.25 per share, placing us at the top of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range compared with $2.45 per share for 2016.
I'll cover the year-over-year segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment. But first, let me just highlight the impact of weather for the quarter and the year.
For the quarter, we experienced $0.01 of favorable domestic weather compared to the prior year and compared to budget, mostly from Kentucky. And for the year, domestic weather negatively impacted our results by $0.04 compared to the prior year and $0.03 compared to budget.  
In the U.K., for the year, weather was flat compared to '16 and favorable by $0.02 compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the full year segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2017, a $0.01 increase over 2016 results. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from additional transmission capital investment and lower operation and maintenance expense. This was partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions, higher financing cost and higher income taxes and other. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.57 per share in 2017, a $0.01 decrease from 2016. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017, of about $0.05, partially offset by lower sales volumes, due to unfavorable weather of negative $0.03 and higher depreciation expense due to asset addition. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.28 per share in 2017, a $0.21 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower year-over-year results were primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.27, which we were expecting; increased depreciation expense from asset addition; and higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt. This was partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily from higher pension income and lower income taxes primarily due to lower U.K. income taxes and the 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions, partially offset by a U.S. tax benefit recorded in 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Moving to Slide 15 and a more detailed review of the impact of U.S. tax reform. As Bill mentioned, U.S. tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rate. The final legislation included many of the provisions we and other electric utilities advocated for, including the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities paid for by foregoing bonus depreciation. However, tax reform does negatively impact earnings and credit due to lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and reduced cash flows at our domestic utilities, as we pass through to customers the lower cost of federal income taxes. And since PPL is not a current federal taxpayer, we will see no immediate corporate cash benefit from the reduced tax rate.
The net result in our credit metrics was a reduction in our FFO to debt metrics into the low 12% range over the planning period, which pressures our current credit rating. Therefore, in response, we expect to settle the foreign currency hedges over the next few years to help mitigate near-term earnings and cash flow impact, and we now plan to increase our equity issuances in 2018. 
In terms of the U.K. segment, tax reform shift to a territorial tax system for foreign entities is not expected to have a material impact on PPL. We were able to successfully mitigate the legislation's onetime incremental tax on accumulated foreign earnings with existing net operating losses and foreign tax credits. 
In addition, the fact that U.S. parent corporations will generally no longer be subject to an incremental U.S. tax on cash repatriation, this provides us with greater flexibility, long term, to repatriate cash from the U.K. 
As referred to in earlier remarks, we've increased the projected amount of cash repatriation from the U.K. to pre-Brexit levels of between $300 million and $500 million per year compared to our prior plan of $100 million to $200 million a year, which also results in a corresponding shift in borrowing from the U.S. to the U.K. segment.
While there is now greater long-term flexibly with regards to repatriation, this decision was primarily driven by the change in the U.S. tax rate and the strengthening of the pound. Overall, the impact of U.S. tax reform was a net benefit to our federal cash tax-paying status, as we don't expect to be a federal cash taxpayer now until 2022 or 2023. 
Lastly, on the regulatory front, on January 29, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the KPSC, to commence returning savings related to tax reform to their customers. In Pennsylvania, the PUC requested comments regarding the impacts of tax reform on customer rates last week. We are preparing our responses to this request and we'll wait for formal guidance from the commission. At this point, we have not received formal guidance from FERC. We will continue to work closely with the applicable regulatory bodies to a appropriately reflect and incorporate the impact of federal tax reform in our rate.
Turning to a discussion of our updated plan. On Slide 16, we show a walk from our 2017 actual ongoing earning of $2.25 per share to the midpoint of our 2018 forecast prior to tax reform of $2.33 per share. We then continue to walk, reflecting the impacts of tax reform and then that our current 2018 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.30 per share. In summary, our 2018 midpoint is still $0.05 per share higher than our strong 2017 results despite the effects of tax reform. 
Looking at the detailed operational drivers on the left-hand side of the slide, our U.K. segment is expected to deliver higher earnings of $0.08 compared to 2017, primarily resulting from a higher foreign currency exchange rate and higher pension income, primarily due to continued pension funding required by our pension trustees, partially offset by higher taxes, primarily the result of $0.11 of tax benefit recorded in 2017 that are not expected to reach repeat in 2018. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we're projecting higher margins of $0.12, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. In terms of our Kentucky margins, the positive projection includes a full year's worth of rate case benefit along with the assumption back-to-normal weather. 
Our pretax reform plan included equity issuances of $350 million per year, which results in about $0.05 of dilution for 2018 compared to 2017. 
Moving to the effects of tax reform on the right-hand side of the slide. As expected, earnings were impacted by about $0.06 from the lower tax shield on holding company interest expense. However, this was more than offset by higher earning on higher domestic rate base, higher foreign currency rates, as we shifted our hedge strategy to let the excess hedge values flow through each year, effectively eliminating the restrike strategy that we were deploying prior to tax reform and other factors. Finally, we see about $0.05 of incremental dilution from the additional $650 million of equity relative to our prior assumption, net of the benefits from lower debt financing.
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $15 billion over the period. Our revised capital plan increased by about $180 million compared to the prior plan, primarily driven by an increase in Pennsylvania distribution spending to maximize reliability. This incremental distribution capital should be subject to recovery under the disk mechanism and is consistent with our most recently approved LTIP filing. 
We also slightly increased our reliability-based capital spending in 2018 through '21 in Kentucky, while shifting some of our environmental spending out to later years.
We currently project our capital investments to be slightly lower in the back end of the plan compared to current levels due to the completion of advanced metering projects in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which is consistent with prior capital plans. We also reflect lower transmission spend in Pennsylvania in '21 and '22, as we only include identified projects in our capital plan. There could be further capital spending opportunities, as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. I'll also point out that this 5-year capital plan does not include Project Compass.
And finally, moving to Slide 18 for a foreign currency update. Post tax reform, we have updated our hedge portfolio to incorporate the lower tax rate of 21%, down from 35%. We are now 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average of $1.34 per pound and 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39. And since the third quarter call, we've continued to layer on additional hedges for 2020 and are now 35% hedged at an average rate of $1.46.
To help offset the earnings and credit impacts from tax reform, we expect to let our current hedges settle in their respective years without significant additional restrikes going forward. The restrike strategy served its purpose to provide some stability and flexibility, as the pound was under a lot of pressure immediately following the Brexit vote in 2016. Looking forward and given the strength of the pound, we would expect to hedge more in line with the ranges established by our risk management framework on a rolling 36-month basis. As a reminder, we target 70% to 100% hedged in year 1; 30% to 70% hedged in year 2; and 0% to 30% hedged in year 3. 
As I mentioned, we've increased our budgeted rate on 2020 open position to be more reflective of current market rates. However, this remains a conservative assumption, as the current average forward rate for 2020 is well above $1.40.

First, we believe that we have a solid, low-risk organic growth plan that we can deliver on. Delivering on this plan, in fact, has been our strategic focus since the spin-off of our competitive generation business. And that focus has not changed. Our intention is squarely on delivering long-term earnings growth, on strengthening our balance sheet and on reaching a positive resolution on the mid-period review in the U.K., all of which we are making progress towards.
We believe PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. Nothing we see on the horizon changes that view. We continue to project, competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend, even post tax reform. We continue to demonstrate an ability to mitigate challenges that affect our business, as we did with Brexit last year and now again, with U.S. tax reform. Our utilities remain among the very best in the regions they serve, and we're continuing to invest responsibly to make the grid smarter, more reliable, more resilient and to advance a cleaner energy future. The bottom line is, we will continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. And we will continue to deliver long-term value to those who invest in PPL.  
With that, operator, let's open the call up for some questions."

As far as equity needs post 2020, we think they're going to be very minimal, probably just the DRIP, $100 million or less per year. So in effect, we've accelerated a lot of the $350 million a year that we would've had otherwise in 2021 and 2022.

But one of the reasons we gave you a range for the equity issuances of -- for '19 and '20 of $500 million to $1 billion was the fact that we have delivered in excess of the midpoint. So taking that into account as well as some of the other moving parts, for example, we don't have the regulatory outcomes yet in Pennsylvania nor at FERC. We think that there is some upside there, not only just in delivering, but that $500 million is probably achievable in terms of the equity in '19 and '20 if things fall in places as they could. So again, kind of being conservative.

On the M&A front, I don't really think that tax reform overall is going to have a significant effect within our sector, whether that's in the EU or here in the U.S. I think -- the 1 effect it could have is, it does remove the uncertainty about what tax reform might have been. So from that perspective, it might create some more opportunity for some. But I don't think the fundamentals of the business, overall, have changed much, because everyone's pretty much on the same level playing field. Now having said that, for PPL specifically, because 50% of our business is in the U.K., and 50% is here, as interest rates rise in the U.S, we've got somewhat of a hedge against rising interest rates here vis-à-vis the U.K. So to the extent that the U.K. interest rates remain much lower than they are here in the U.S, that could be a positive to the stock. And I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change from the PPL perspective in our view of M&A. So what we've said in the past is that we can be successful with the organic growth plan that we have. We don't need M&A to be successful.

Said another way, I'm unaware of any transaction that would meet these objectives today. Our focus is clearly on delivering long-term earnings growth, which we can do organically. I'd also mention that, currently, we think our stock is undervalue and we believe that transaction multiples are currently -- continue to be pretty excessive, and would not allow us to achieve our objectives in any M&A, kind of, scenario."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2017 results and a look at 2018 and beyond in light of U.S. tax reform. I'll discuss the strength of our dividend and our commitment to dividend growth. I will also provide an update on the U.K. regulatory environment. Vince will then review our 2017 segment earning results and provide a more detailed financial overview of our updated financial outlook. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
On Slide 4, very briefly, I'd like to start with the state of our business in light of U.S. tax reform. Tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rates. The credit impacts of tax reform on PPL were more than we were expecting, given the enacted tax rate of 21% compared to our expectation of 25%. We've taken steps to mitigate the impact of the lower corporate tax rate on earnings and our cash flows. In short, we've added an additional equity to our plan in 2018, we've increased our cash distributions from the U.K., and we're utilizing the excess value in our foreign currency hedges in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we move through the presentation this morning.
While there've been a number of changes with respect to our business plan, there are a number of items that actually have not changed. We still expect to grow earnings per share by 5% to 6% through 2020 off of our new 2018 base year. Our updated plan reflects higher projected 2020 earnings per share compared to our previous estimate, despite the effects of tax reform. 
We're committed to continue dividend growth and today, we announced the 4% increase in the dividend, consistent with our prior expectations. We are intent on maintaining solid credit ratings as well. We maintain the significant level of capital investment that also drives our long-term value. And we strive for operational performance, excellence each day. And we will deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. 
The state of our business remains strong, even as we've addressed the impacts of U.S. tax reform.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced that we achieved the high end of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range or $2.25 per share. This was the eighth consecutive year that PPL exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast, which highlights the operational excellence of our pure-play regulated utilities. The $0.07 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance of $2.18 per share was due to lower O&M expenses in the U.S. and U.K. and favorable weather in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2018. We've updated our business plan to reflect the impacts of U.S. tax reform and our mitigation actions and have announced our formal 2018 guidance range of $2.20 a share to $2.40 per share with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2017 actual ongoing earnings to the 2018 midpoint later during his remarks. But in summary, despite tax reform, our 2018 midpoint is $0.05 higher than our very strong 2017 results. 
Looking longer term, our objective with this updated business plan is to continue to provide 5% to 6% earnings per share growth through 2020 while improving our credit metrics. We've established the 2018 midpoint as the new baseline for the 5% to 6% growth to coincide with the effective date of tax reform. As expected, the largest adverse effect of U.S. tax reform was on our projected credit metrics, with FFO to debt dropping into the low 12% range over the plan period prior to any mitigation effects.
In order to support our current ratings with S&P and Moody's, we're targeting to get back to an FFO to debt ratio of 13% by the end of 2019. We've taken several steps laying the groundwork to achieve this goal. First, we are utilizing the excess hedge value in 2018 through 2020 to mitigate the near-term tax impact to earnings and cash flow by letting our current hedges settle in their respective years. We feel comfortable with this revised strategy, given the strength of where the pound is trading against the dollar today. Secondly, we plan to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018 compared to our prior guidance for equity issuances of $350 million per year. Our additional equity needs beyond 2018 will be dependent upon the performance of our businesses, foreign currency and regulatory outcomes. Currently, we expect to issue between $500 million and $1 billion of equity in 2019 and 2020 with very minimal equity needs beyond 2020. We will work to minimize the amount of additional equity needed in 2019 and 2020. Even at the high end of the equity range, we are confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings growth through 2020. And at the low end of the range, we would actually exceed our EPS growth of 5% to 6% guidance through 2020. 
Turning to the dividend. I want to reiterate that our dividend is secure, and we remain committed to dividend growth. In every quarter since 1946, we have paid a dividend to our shareowners, and PPL's dividend continues to be an important piece of our overall shareowner return. This year is no exception. We announced the 4% dividend increase for 2018 with an annualized rate of $1.64 per share. I should point out that given our yield is significantly above our peer average, we will continue to monitor this as we consider the growth rate moving forward. We believe that disconnect between our yield and that of our peers is temporary, driven by the current political and regulatory uncertainty that exists in the U.K. I want to reiterate our position on the U.K. regulatory model, in that, it remains a premium jurisdiction.
Vince and I, along with Robert Symons, recently had a very constructive meeting with the most senior members of Ofgem, the regulator in the U.K. Following that meeting, we feel even more confident that WPD is well positioned for long-term success under the RIIO regulatory framework and that the mid-period review will not be a material event for WPD or for PPL. I'll talk more about my thoughts on the U.K. in a few minutes. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 where we outline some of our significant accomplishments in 2017. In addition to our strong financial results, from an operational standpoint, we continue to invest in the future, successfully executing on $3.5 billion worth of infrastructure improvements. These investments continue to make our U.S. and U.K. networks smarter, more reliable, more sustainable and more resilient. In Pennsylvania, we installed about 600,000 advanced meters, completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of our $160 million Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project and added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to enhance distribution automation and strengthen grid resilience and reliability.
In Kentucky, we completed a 20-year 540-mile gas main replacement project in the Louisville area and made significant progress of more than $800 million in environmental upgrades as part of a 10-year project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants.  
And in the U.K., we continue to make progress on our asset replacement and fault management plans as well as advancing nearly 2 dozen low-carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of renewable energy resources. As we executed these investment plans, we remain focused on continuous improvement and value for our customers. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. PPL Electric Utilities also achieved the lowest OSHA recordable injury rate as well as the highest customer satisfaction rate in our company's history. 
The company finished the year near the top decile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. 
In 2017, our Pennsylvania customers experienced 550,000 fewer power outages than they did just 10 years ago.
In Kentucky, LG&E and KU achieved the company's lowest OSHA recordable injury rate in their history, finishing among the best in a group of comparable utilities nationwide, while also improving reliability for our customers. In 2017, LG&E and KU also had their best performance for customer reliability in more than a decade. Since 2010, our Kentucky Utilities have reduced both the frequency and duration of customer outages by 35% and 34%, respectively.
On the generation side of the business, the utilities achieved their lowest combined annual forced outage rate since 2004, once again, putting us in the top quartile of our peers' forced outage metric for the year. 
And in the U.K., WPD remains on track to achieve its 2017, 2018 performance incentive targets, which include reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, with its 4 distribution network operators maintaining the top 4 spots for customer satisfaction among all the U.K. P&Ls. 
This is a testament that the capital dollars we are spending across all 3 of our business lines are providing real value for customers. 
Also, in 2017, LG&E and KU received Kentucky Public Service Commission approval for a combined rate increase of $116 million with new rates taking effect July 1 of last year.
As we executed on our business plans in 2017, we also remained committed to transparency and sustainability. In November, PPL released the detailed scenario-based climate assessment report, examining the potential impact of climate policies on PPL, consistent with a shareowner request for increased disclosure. In December, we issued our completed Edison Electric Institute environmental, social and governance reporting template. PPL was one of the number of EEI member companies that helped to develop the template to provide investors a condensed, consistent look at sustainability metrics across our sector. In January of this year, we announced a new goal to cut the company's carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2010 levels by the year 2050. We expect to achieve these reductions by economically replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, improving our energy efficiency, reducing substation greenhouse gas emissions and cutting vehicle fleet emissions. We also announced our intent to respond to CDP's annual climate survey. 
In summary, once again in 2017, we demonstrated strong execution across our U.S. and U.K. businesses, as we position the company for continued growth and success.
Turning to Slide 7. I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.  However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree to sector, in general, we'll see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO.  
From our side, we communicated to Ofgem, the concerns we've been hearing directly from our investors about the uncertainty of the U.K. regulation and the impact it's having on investor confidence. We are also aware that some of our investors are actively engaging with Ofgem and expressing their views and concerns to them directly. I would encourage you to continue that direct engagement and to respond to the formal consultation processes as we have done for the mid-period review and plan to do on the RIIO-2 consultation.
As many of you know, the consultation process is underway to determine if a mid-period review for ED1 is required, with a decision expected in the spring of 2018. Ofgem notes that the MPR mechanism was intended to be very limited in scope and that they have not identified any issues that meet the original scope definition. Given that fact, we firmly believe that an MPR, with an extension of scope, would ultimately lead to increased cost for customers, as regulatory uncertainty will likely drive higher equity risk premium and higher financing costs. We have made that clear to Ofgem on behalf of our shareowners and other stakeholders in our formal consultation response, and they acknowledged that they have heard the same message from many others as well. Based on everything we are aware of to date, we do not expect the MPR to have a material impact on our future results. 
Regarding RIIO-ED2, we believe it's far too early to predict any outcomes, as the rules have not yet been developed by Ofgem. However, with Ofgem's statements that the best-performing company should still be able to earn double-digit returns and that they want to drive more differentiation between the best and worst-performing DNOs, we believe WPD is very well positioned to succeed in that type of regulatory construct in RIIO-ED2.
Ofgem expects to consult with stakeholders in early 2018 on the proposed structure for the broader RIIO-2 framework. 
WPD and PPL will have an opportunity to share their views with Ofgem during this phase, similar to prior price control reviews.
Finally, I would like to add that we still have 5 years before the next rate period takes effect, which begins in April of 2023. We've been very successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and mitigating earnings impacts. As we move forward, we will work constructively with Ofgem to continue to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. In addition, we will keep investors informed of the ongoing regulatory processes and provide greater visibility into U.K. regulation and financial results. In fact, we are providing expanded disclosures on the U.K. regulated section -- segment, rather, in the business section of our 10-K that will be filed later today. 
Moving to Slide 8, we've updated this slide to reflect our base rate -- I'm sorry, our rate base and earnings growth, post tax reform. We expect U.S. rate base to be higher relative to our prior plan due to the lower tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. We now project our combined regulated rate base to grow by 6.4% through 2020, increasing to $31 billion. We continue to expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $10 billion in infrastructure investment we plan to make during that period, which supports our 5% to 6% EPS growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earn",2001,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10 for a review of our financial results.
Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full year 2017 reported earnings were $1.64 per share compared to $2.79 per share a year ago. Lower reported earnings for the quarter and the year reflect a current year noncash loss of $321 million or $0.47 per share due to the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December of 2017. This loss was driven by a reduction to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforward of about $120 million and pension and other compensation-related liabilities of about $90 million to reflect the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, we established a valuation allowance of about $100 million related to foreign tax credits associated with the transition from a worldwide to a territorial approach to taxing foreign earnings. 
Adjusting for special items, including the effects of tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.60 per share a year ago. The $0.05 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11, primarily due to higher income taxes due to a benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits and lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The lower U.K. results were partially offset by higher domestic gross margin in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky and lower operation and maintenance expense in Pennsylvania. 
Moving to the bottom table. Full year earnings from ongoing operations were at $2.25 per share, placing us at the top of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range compared with $2.45 per share for 2016.
I'll cover the year-over-year segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment. But first, let me just highlight the impact of weather for the quarter and the year.
For the quarter, we experienced $0.01 of favorable domestic weather compared to the prior year and compared to budget, mostly from Kentucky. And for the year, domestic weather negatively impacted our results by $0.04 compared to the prior year and $0.03 compared to budget.  
In the U.K., for the year, weather was flat compared to '16 and favorable by $0.02 compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the full year segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2017, a $0.01 increase over 2016 results. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from additional transmission capital investment and lower operation and maintenance expense. This was partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions, higher financing cost and higher income taxes and other. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.57 per share in 2017, a $0.01 decrease from 2016. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017, of about $0.05, partially offset by lower sales volumes, due to unfavorable weather of negative $0.03 and higher depreciation expense due to asset addition. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.28 per share in 2017, a $0.21 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower year-over-year results were primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.27, which we were expecting; increased depreciation expense from asset addition; and higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt. This was partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily from higher pension income and lower income taxes primarily due to lower U.K. income taxes and the 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions, partially offset by a U.S. tax benefit recorded in 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Moving to Slide 15 and a more detailed review of the impact of U.S. tax reform. As Bill mentioned, U.S. tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rate. The final legislation included many of the provisions we and other electric utilities advocated for, including the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities paid for by foregoing bonus depreciation. However, tax reform does negatively impact earnings and credit due to lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and reduced cash flows at our domestic utilities, as we pass through to customers the lower cost of federal income taxes. And since PPL is not a current federal taxpayer, we will see no immediate corporate cash benefit from the reduced tax rate.
The net result in our credit metrics was a reduction in our FFO to debt metrics into the low 12% range over the planning period, which pressures our current credit rating. Therefore, in response, we expect to settle the foreign currency hedges over the next few years to help mitigate near-term earnings and cash flow impact, and we now plan to increase our equity issuances in 2018. 
In terms of the U.K. segment, tax reform shift to a territorial tax system for foreign entities is not expected to have a material impact on PPL. We were able to successfully mitigate the legislation's onetime incremental tax on accumulated foreign earnings with existing net operating losses and foreign tax credits. 
In addition, the fact that U.S. parent corporations will generally no longer be subject to an incremental U.S. tax on cash repatriation, this provides us with greater flexibility, long term, to repatriate cash from the U.K. 
As referred to in earlier remarks, we've increased the projected amount of cash repatriation from the U.K. to pre-Brexit levels of between $300 million and $500 million per year compared to our prior plan of $100 million to $200 million a year, which also results in a corresponding shift in borrowing from the U.S. to the U.K. segment.
While there is now greater long-term flexibly with regards to repatriation, this decision was primarily driven by the change in the U.S. tax rate and the strengthening of the pound. Overall, the impact of U.S. tax reform was a net benefit to our federal cash tax-paying status, as we don't expect to be a federal cash taxpayer now until 2022 or 2023. 
Lastly, on the regulatory front, on January 29, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the KPSC, to commence returning savings related to tax reform to their customers. In Pennsylvania, the PUC requested comments regarding the impacts of tax reform on customer rates last week. We are preparing our responses to this request and we'll wait for formal guidance from the commission. At this point, we have not received formal guidance from FERC. We will continue to work closely with the applicable regulatory bodies to a appropriately reflect and incorporate the impact of federal tax reform in our rate.
Turning to a discussion of our updated plan. On Slide 16, we show a walk from our 2017 actual ongoing earning of $2.25 per share to the midpoint of our 2018 forecast prior to tax reform of $2.33 per share. We then continue to walk, reflecting the impacts of tax reform and then that our current 2018 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.30 per share. In summary, our 2018 midpoint is still $0.05 per share higher than our strong 2017 results despite the effects of tax reform. 
Looking at the detailed operational drivers on the left-hand side of the slide, our U.K. segment is expected to deliver higher earnings of $0.08 compared to 2017, primarily resulting from a higher foreign currency exchange rate and higher pension income, primarily due to continued pension funding required by our pension trustees, partially offset by higher taxes, primarily the result of $0.11 of tax benefit recorded in 2017 that are not expected to reach repeat in 2018. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we're projecting higher margins of $0.12, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. In terms of our Kentucky margins, the positive projection includes a full year's worth of rate case benefit along with the assumption back-to-normal weather. 
Our pretax reform plan included equity issuances of $350 million per year, which results in about $0.05 of dilution for 2018 compared to 2017. 
Moving to the effects of tax reform on the right-hand side of the slide. As expected, earnings were impacted by about $0.06 from the lower tax shield on holding company interest expense. However, this was more than offset by higher earning on higher domestic rate base, higher foreign currency rates, as we shifted our hedge strategy to let the excess hedge values flow through each year, effectively eliminating the restrike strategy that we were deploying prior to tax reform and other factors. Finally, we see about $0.05 of incremental dilution from the additional $650 million of equity relative to our prior assumption, net of the benefits from lower debt financing.
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $15 billion over the period. Our revised capital plan increased by about $180 million compared to the prior plan, primarily driven by an increase in Pennsylvania distribution spending to maximize reliability. This incremental distribution capital should be subject to recovery under the disk mechanism and is consistent with our most recently approved LTIP filing. 
We also slightly increased our reliability-based capital spending in 2018 through '21 in Kentucky, while shifting some of our environmental spending out to later years.
We currently project our capital investments to be slightly lower in the back end of the plan compared to current levels due to the completion of advanced metering projects in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which is consistent with prior capital plans. We also reflect lower transmission spend in Pennsylvania in '21 and '22, as we only include identified projects in our capital plan. There could be further capital spending opportunities, as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. I'll also point out that this 5-year capital plan does not include Project Compass.
And finally, moving to Slide 18 for a foreign currency update. Post tax reform, we have updated our hedge portfolio to incorporate the lower tax rate of 21%, down from 35%. We are now 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average of $1.34 per pound and 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39. And since the third quarter call, we've continued to layer on additional hedges for 2020 and are now 35% hedged at an average rate of $1.46.
To help offset the earnings and credit impacts from tax reform, we expect to let our current hedges settle in their respective years without significant additional restrikes going forward. The restrike strategy served its purpose to provide some stability and flexibility, as the pound was under a lot of pressure immediately following the Brexit vote in 2016. Looking forward and given the strength of the pound, we would expect to hedge more in line with the ranges established by our risk management framework on a rolling 36-month basis. As a reminder, we target 70% to 100% hedged in year 1; 30% to 70% hedged in year 2; and 0% to 30% hedged in year 3. 
As I mentioned, we've increased our budgeted rate on 2020 open position to be more reflective of current market rates. However, this remains a conservative assumption, as the current average forward rate for 2020 is well above $1.40.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

First, we believe that we have a solid, low-risk organic growth plan that we can deliver on. Delivering on this plan, in fact, has been our strategic focus since the spin-off of our competitive generation business. And that focus has not changed. Our intention is squarely on delivering long-term earnings growth, on strengthening our balance sheet and on reaching a positive resolution on the mid-period review in the U.K., all of which we are making progress towards.
We believe PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. Nothing we see on the horizon changes that view. We continue to project, competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend, even post tax reform. We continue to demonstrate an ability to mitigate challenges that affect our business, as we did with Brexit last year and now again, with U.S. tax reform. Our utilities remain among the very best in the regions they serve, and we're continuing to invest responsibly to make the grid smarter, more reliable, more resilient and to advance a cleaner energy future. The bottom line is, we will continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. And we will continue to deliver long-term value to those who invest in PPL.  
With that, operator, let's open the call up for some questions."

But one of the reasons we gave you a range for the equity issuances of -- for '19 and '20 of $500 million to $1 billion was the fact that we have delivered in excess of the midpoint. So taking that into account as well as some of the other moving parts, for example, we don't have the regulatory outcomes yet in Pennsylvania nor at FERC. We think that there is some upside there, not only just in delivering, but that $500 million is probably achievable in terms of the equity in '19 and '20 if things fall in places as they could. So again, kind of being conservative.

Now having said that, for PPL specifically, because 50% of our business is in the U.K., and 50% is here, as interest rates rise in the U.S, we've got somewhat of a hedge against rising interest rates here vis-à-vis the U.K. So to the extent that the U.K. interest rates remain much lower than they are here in the U.S, that could be a positive to the stock. And I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change from the PPL perspective in our view of M&A. So what we've said in the past is that we can be successful with the organic growth plan that we have. We don't need M&A to be successful. I think we've been pretty transparent that as we think about M&A, our objective has been to strengthen our EPS growth rate and credit metrics, if you were to engage in M&A. Said another way, I'm unaware of any transaction that would meet these objectives today. Our focus is clearly on delivering long-term earnings growth, which we can do organically. I'd also mention that, currently, we think our stock is undervalue and we believe that transaction multiples are currently -- continue to be pretty excessive, and would not allow us to achieve our objectives in any M&A, kind of, scenario."

Moving to Slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of 2018 first quarter results and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our first quarter 2018 segment earnings results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we have an ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today we announced strong first quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.74 per share, up almost 20% from $0.62 per share a year ago. This increase was driven by higher earnings in our U.S. segment, partially offset by expected lower earnings in the U.K. segment. 
We performed a very well against our business plans in Q1 putting PPL solidly on track to deliver on our 2018 earnings forecast of $2.20 per share to $2.40 per share. 
Today, we are also affirming our long-term projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2018 through 2020 off of our 2018 forecast midpoint. In addition, we're updating are expected equity needs. 
On our year-end call, we communicated and equity needs of between $2 billion and $3 billion from 2018 to 2020. That was approximately $1 billion to $2 billion higher than our prior plans as a result of tax reform. We are now targeting to be near the low end of our previously announced a range driven primarily by revisions to our business plan as we've continued to assess and revise our expectations regarding the impact of tax reform. 
Achieving our updated equity target would result in annual earnings growth rate and the high end of the 5% to 6% range. 
Turning to U.K. regulatory and political update on Slide 5. On April 30, Ofgem announced that they have determined that no mid-period review is necessary for RIIO-ED1. We believe Ofgem through their consultation process arrived at the best outcome for all stakeholders. We appreciated the opportunity to share our views with Ofgem during the consultation phase and that they ultimately decided to adhere to the regulatory construct they developed with the distribution companies. 
We believe this is an important regulation, which we continue to view as one of the premerger inspections. We look forward to continuing to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. I should also note that WPD has agreed to voluntarily return to customers GBP 77 million related to the rail electrification project -- projects rather in WPD's territories that were curtailed by the government in mid-2017. 
This voluntary return will not have a material impact to PPL and was outside of the scope of the mid-period review. As Ofgem noted, this voluntary return of funds to customers by WPD was a key consideration in their decision not to conduct an extension of the mid-period review. Ofgem also noted that adjusting network returns would damage investor confidence and could increase financing cost for networks. We believe Ofgem's decision is a very positive step for the industry, as it demonstrates that Ofgem understands the need to balance all stakeholders needs. 
In other U.K. regulatory developments, Ofgem released its RIIO-2 framework consultation document on March 7 with yesterday marking the deadline for stakeowner responses. As we stated, the consultation was in line with our expectations and we believe WPD can continue to provide customer benefits, while still meeting shareowner expectations. Ofgem has determined that the current framework is generally working for customers and we agree. We shared in our consultation response that our view is that RIIO-1 has worked well so far in controlling costs to consumers, strengthening customer service and reliability, improving customer satisfaction, spurring network investment and fostering greater innovation. 
For example, the sector continue to reduce the number of power cuts across Great Britain during the 2016/2017 regulatory year. Since privatization, there has been a 50% reduction in the number of customer interruptions and a 60% reduction in the length of customer interruptions. 
On the innovation front, the industry accommodated a 60% increase in small-scale generation connections during the 2016/2017 regulatory year. More than 2.8 gigawatts was connected to the electric distribution network over that period. Finally, customer satisfaction is at a record high since RIIO network sector and world reports began tracking these metrics. It's clear from these examples that there is already strong evidence in the first 2 years of RIIO-ED1 that demonstrates the RIIO strategy is on course to deliver on its objectives. 
Ultimately, we think of the wide range of proposals in the RIIO-2 consultation document offers us an opportunity to help shape the regulation in ways that are supportive of high-performing and innovative network such as WPD's. 
We focused our response to the consultation on 4 key areas; fair returns, incentives, the cost of debt and the cost of equity. Relative to the potential for lower returns on equity, I would point out that we are in a period where the U.K. risk-free rate is negative by approximately 100 basis points. This is about 200 basis points lower than the 10 and 20 year averages. WPD's cost of equity will be set during the electric distribution consultation that will take place in 2020/2021 time frame. By that time, we would expect the risk-free rate to be in positive territory, more in line with historical rates. 
In addition, we expect significant opportunities for continued investments throughout the next price control period as the U.K. continues to advance its initiative related to electrification and infrastructure requirements to support renewable energy resources. And we have ample time to prepare for any changes that could be made for RIIO-ED2 with our business plan submissions not due until the mid-2021 period. 
We remain confident in the U.K. regulatory framework and our ability to develop a high-quality plan for the future that will benefit customers and shareowners. The next step in the RIIO-ED2 process its Ofgem Ofgem's decision regarding the broader RIIO-2 framework consultation, which is expected later this summer following their review of stakeholder responses. 
Finally, on the political front, we see an improved environment with Brexit moving forward and radical calls for re-nationalization beginning to fade. In addition, the pound has strengthened considerably over the past 12 to 18 months and we have been able to hedge into this strength, as Vince will share a few moments. 
On Slide 6, we provide an example of our Rio ED1 execution outlining our strong U.K. incentive performance for that 2017/2018 regulatory period. As you can see, WPD's operating companies once again earned the top 4 rankings in terms of customer satisfaction among all the distribution network operators in the U.K. with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10. 
In addition, we achieved more than 70% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, reflecting our continued drive to deliver value for our customers. This translates into future returns for our shareowners as we earned approximately $100 million of incentive revenues for the regulatory period consistent with our historical performance and our expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings",747,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings guidance at this point given that we are only through Q1, but we are very confident that we can deliver the midpoint of our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance and our tracking above that midpoint today. 
Let's move to Slide 8 for an overview of first quarter segment results. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 over the prior year driven by strong results at our domestic utilities. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment improved by $0.09 and Kentucky Regulated improved by $0.05 compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was also higher by $0.06, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in Q1 of 2017. These improved domestic earnings were partially offset by expected lower earnings at the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.08. 
Before we discuss segment details, I'll review the impact of weather on our Q1 results. Overall, we saw about a $0.02 improvement compared to the prior year due to weather with domestic weather driving a $0.04 improvement from Q1 2017, partially offset by $0.02 of unfavorable weather in the U.K. The U.S. returned to no more normal weather in Q1 2018 compared to last year's mild winter temperatures. As a result, our Kentucky operations experienced a 30% increase in heating degree days, while we saw more than a 10% increase in Pennsylvania quarter-over-quarter. 
Weather was not a significant factor compared to our budget for the first quarter 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period a year ago. This result was driven primarily by higher transmission margins from additional capital investment and higher peak transmission system demand in 2018. 
Higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes due to weather, lower operation and maintenance expenses due to lower corporate services because as well as lower payroll and lower income taxes resulting from the lower federal tax rate from U.S. tax reform. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017 and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions. 
Note that for Kentucky, the impact of lower federal tax rate is reflected on the income taxes as another line item with the offset being lower revenues reflected in adjusted gross margins, off being about $0.03. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in Q1 2018, an $0.08 decline compared to a year ago. The reduction in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes driven by a tax benefit that we recorded in Q1 2017 related to accelerated pension contributions that did not recur in 2018 and higher U.K. income taxes due to accelerated tax reductions in Q1 2017. In addition, we experienced lower adjusted gross margins in the U.K. driven by the April 1, 2017 price decrease of penny and lower sales volume of a penny. The price decrease was due to true up mechanisms primarily for interest and inflation and was partially offset by higher base demand revenues from the normal annual price increases. These lower results were, partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 12. The pound has continued to show strength versus the U.S. dollar and we layer on additional hedges since year-end. We have increased our hedge position in 2020 to about 50% at an average rate of $1.49 per pound. The chart on the right shows the trend of improving rates over the past year with the current forward curve continuing to be well above our budgeted rate of $1.40 per pound. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

And clearly, Ofgem is not going to set that rate for us today. So that rate for us will not be set until roughly 2021. So by that point, we would think that Brexit would be well behind us that the Bank of England would be not fundamentally doing what they've been doing to kind of keep interest rates low, very low and that the situation would improve.

Moving to Slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 first quarter results and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our first quarter 2018 segment earnings results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong first quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.74 per share, up almost 20% from $0.62 per share a year ago. This increase was driven by higher earnings in our U.S. segment, partially offset by expected lower earnings in the U.K. segment. 
We performed very well against our business plans in Q1, putting PPL solidly on track to deliver on our 2018 earnings forecast of $2.20 per share to $2.40 per share.
Today, we are also affirming our long-term projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2018 through 2020, off of our 2018 forecast midpoint. In addition, we're updating our expected equity needs.
On our year-end call, we communicated an equity need of between $2 billion and $3 billion from 2018 to 2020. That was approximately $1 billion to $2 billion higher than our prior plans as a result of tax reform. We are now targeting to be near the low end of our previously announced range, driven primarily by revisions to our business plan as we've continued to assess and revise our expectations regarding the impact of tax reform. Achieving our updated equity target would result in an earnings growth rate at the high end of the 5% to 6% range.
Turning to U.K. regulatory and political update on Slide 5. On April 30, Ofgem announced that they've determined that no mid-period review is necessary for RIIO-ED1. We believe Ofgem through their consultation process arrived at the best outcome for all stakeholders. We appreciated the opportunity to share our views with Ofgem during the consultation phase and that they ultimately decided to adhere to the regulatory construct they developed with the distribution companies.
We believe this is an important signal of support for U.K. regulation, which we continue to view as one of the premier jurisdictions. We look forward to continuing to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. I should also note that WPD has agreed to voluntarily return to customers GBP 77 million related to the rail electrification project -- projects rather, in WPD's territories that were curtailed by the government in mid-2017. This voluntary return will not have a material impact to PPL and was outside of the scope of the mid-period review. As Ofgem noted, this voluntary return of funds to customers by WPD was a key consideration in their decision not to conduct an extension of the mid-period review. Ofgem also noted that adjusting network returns would damage investor confidence and could increase financing cost for networks. We believe Ofgem's decision is a very positive step for the industry, as it demonstrates that Ofgem understands the need to balance all stakeholders' needs.
In other U.K. regulatory developments, Ofgem released its RIIO-2 framework consultation document on March 7 with yesterday marking the deadline for stakeowner responses. As we've stated, the consultation was in line with our expectations, and we believe WPD can continue to provide customer benefits, while still meeting shareowner expectations.
Ofgem has determined that the current framework is generally working for customers, and we agree. We shared in our consultation response that our view is that RIIO-1 has worked well so far in controlling costs to consumers, strengthening customer service and reliability, improving customer satisfaction, spurring network investment and fostering greater innovation. For example, the sector continued to reduce the number of power cuts across Great Britain during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. Since privatization, there has been a 50% reduction in the number of customer interruptions and a 60% reduction in the length of customer interruptions.
On the innovation front, the industry accommodated a 60% increase in small-scale generation connections during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. More than 2.8 gigawatts was connected to the electric distribution network over that period. Finally, customer satisfaction is at a record high since RIIO network sector annual reports began tracking these metrics. It's clear from these examples that there is already strong evidence in the first 2 years of RIIO-ED1 that demonstrates the RIIO strategy is on course to deliver on its objectives.
Ultimately, we think the wide range of proposals in the RIIO-2 consultation document offers us an opportunity to help shape the regulation in ways that are supportive of high-performing and innovative network, such as WPD's.
We focused our response to the consultation on 4 key areas; fair returns, incentives, the cost of debt and the cost of equity. Relative to the potential for lower returns on equity, I would point out that we are in a period where the U.K. risk-free rate is negative by approximately 100 basis points. This is about 200 basis points lower than the 10- and 20-year averages. WPD's cost of equity will be set during the electric distribution consultation that will take place in 2020-2021 time frame. By that time, we would expect the risk-free rate to be in positive territory, more in line with historical rates.
In addition, we expect significant opportunities for continued investment throughout the next price-control period as the U.K. continues to advance its initiative related to electrification and infrastructure requirements to support renewable energy resources. And we have ample time to prepare for any changes that could be made for RIIO-ED2 with our business plan submissions not due until the mid-2021 period.
We remain confident in the U.K. regulatory framework and our ability to develop a high-quality plan for the future that will benefit customers and shareowners. The next step in the RIIO-ED2 process is Ofgem's decision regarding the broader RIIO-2 framework consultation, which is expected later this summer following their review of stakeholder responses.
Finally, on the political front, we see an improved environment with Brexit moving forward and radical calls for renationalization beginning to fade. In addition, the pound has strengthened considerably over the past 12 to 18 months, and we have been able to hedge into this strength, as Vince will share in a few moments.
On Slide 6, we provide an example of our RIIO-ED1 execution outlining our strong U.K. incentive performance for the 2017-2018 regulatory period. As you can see, WPD's operating companies once again earned the top 4 rankings in terms of customer satisfaction among all the distribution network operators in the U.K. with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10.
In addition, we achieved more than 70% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, reflecting our continued drive to deliver value for our customers. This translates into future returns for our shareowners as we earned approximately $100 million of incentive revenues for the regulatory period consistent with our historical performance and our expectations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year.

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings guidance at this point given that we are only through Q1, but we are very confident that we can deliver the midpoint of our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance and are tracking above that midpoint today.
Let's move to Slide 8 for an overview of first quarter segment results. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 over the prior year, driven by strong results at our domestic utilities. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment improved by $0.09 and Kentucky Regulated improved by $0.05 compared to 2017.
Corporate and other was also higher by $0.06, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in Q1 of 2017. These improved domestic earnings were partially offset by expected lower earnings at the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.08.
Before we discuss segment details, I'll review the impact of weather on our Q1 results. Overall, we saw about a $0.02 improvement compared to the prior year due to weather with domestic weather driving a $0.04 improvement from Q1 2017, partially offset by $0.02 of unfavorable weather in the U.K. The U.S. returned to more normal weather in Q1 2018 compared to last year's mild winter temperatures. As a result, our Kentucky operations experienced a 30% increase in heating degree days, while we saw more than a 10% increase in Pennsylvania quarter-over-quarter. Weather was not a significant factor compared to our budget for the first quarter 2018.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period a year ago. This result was driven primarily by higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher peak transmission system demand in 2018, higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes due to weather, lower operation and maintenance expenses due to lower corporate services costs as well as lower payroll, and lower income taxes resulting from the lower federal tax rate from U.S. tax reform.
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Note that for Kentucky, the impact of lower federal tax rate is reflected on the income taxes in other line item with the offset being lower revenues reflected in adjusted gross margins, off being about $0.03.
Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in Q1 2018, an $0.08 decline compared to a year ago. The reduction in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes, driven by a tax benefit that we recorded in Q1 2017 related to accelerated pension contributions that did not recur in 2018, and higher U.K. income taxes due to accelerated tax deductions in Q1 2017. In addition, we experienced lower adjusted gross margins in the U.K., driven by the April 1, 2017 price decrease of $0.01 and lower sales volume of $0.01. The price decrease was due to true-up mechanisms, primarily for interest and inflation, and was partially offset by higher base demand revenue from the normal annual price increases. These lower results were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 12. The pound has continued to show strength versus the U.S. dollar, and we layered on additional hedges since year-end. We have increased our hedge position in 2020 to about 50% at an average rate of $1.49 per pound. The chart on the right shows the trend of improving rates over the past year with the current forward curve continuing to be well above our budgeted rate of $1.40 per pound.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

And to be honest, given that is why we issued a range of equity between $2 billion to $3 billion, given how much we tried to get done in a relatively short period of time. Subsequent to the call, we just went back and continued to refine the analysis with a strong focus on FFO. Because as we've talked in the past, FFO carries a lot more weight in the FFO to debt metric than reducing debt does. It's about an 8x multiple on the leverage that you get there. And -- so as we kind of reiterate -- or iterated the plan, we found we were a bit too conservative in the way we modeled some depreciation aspects and how that kind of flowed through the cash flows and the earnings. That was, to be honest with you, the bulk of it and then there was just a little bit in a bunch of other line items that we found.

We are currently in the process of dialoguing with the PaPUC on exactly how the industry and specific companies will handle the effects of tax reform. On March 15, the commission -- actually, before that, they had sent out a secretarial letter requesting information from all of the utilities. We responded to that. On March 15, they set rates to be temporary and then basically, 6 months with the option to expand it another 6 months and they are now really assessing the impacts. They also asked if the utilities had either capital or other projects that we could redeploy the revenues that we were collecting from the higher tax rate. And so we've submitted ideas around that. So at this point, we're not sure if or when we would have to give the revenue back on the distribution side. And then, on transmission, we filed our formula rate, June 1 -- effective June 1, and that's when we will make the reduction from 35% to 21% in that filing."

Moving to Slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 first quarter results and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our first quarter 2018 segment earnings results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong first quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.74 per share, up almost 20% from $0.62 per share a year ago. This increase was driven by higher earnings in our U.S. segments, partially offset by expected lower earnings in the U.K. segment.
We performed very well against our business plans in Q1, putting PPL solidly on track to deliver on our 2018 earnings forecast of $2.20 per share to $2.40 per share.
Today, we are also affirming our long-term projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2018 through 2020, off of our 2018 forecast midpoint. In addition, we're updating our expected equity needs.
On our year-end call, we communicated an equity need of between $2 billion and $3 billion from 2018 to 2020. That was approximately $1 billion to $2 billion higher than our prior plans as a result of tax reform. We are now targeting to be near the low end of our previously announced range, driven primarily by revisions to our business plan as we've continued to assess and revise our expectations regarding the impact of tax reform. Achieving our updated equity target would result in an earnings growth rate at the high end of the 5% to 6% range.
Turning to a U.K. regulatory and political update on Slide 5. On April 30, Ofgem announced that they've determined that no mid-period review is necessary for RIIO-ED1. We believe Ofgem through their consultation process arrived at the best outcome for all stakeholders. We appreciated the opportunity to share our views with Ofgem during the consultation phase and that they ultimately decided to adhere to the regulatory construct they developed with the distribution companies.
We believe this is an important signal of support for U.K. regulation, which we continue to view as one of the premier jurisdictions. We look forward to continuing to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. I should also note that WPD has agreed to voluntarily return to customers GBP 77 million related to the rail electrification project -- projects rather, in WPD's territories that were curtailed by the government in mid-2017. This voluntary return will not have a material impact to PPL and was outside of the scope of the mid-period review. As Ofgem noted, this voluntary return of funds to customers by WPD was a key consideration in their decision not to conduct an extension of the mid-period review. Ofgem also noted that adjusting network returns would damage investor confidence and could increase financing cost for networks. We believe Ofgem's decision is a very positive step for the industry, as it demonstrates that Ofgem understands the need to balance all stakeholders' needs.
In other U.K. regulatory developments, Ofgem released its RIIO-2 framework consultation document on March 7 with yesterday marking the deadline for stakeowner responses. As we've stated, the consultation was in line with our expectations, and we believe WPD can continue to provide customer benefits while still meeting shareowner expectations.
Ofgem has determined that the current framework is generally working for customers, and we agree. We shared in our consultation response that our view is that RIIO-1 has worked well so far in controlling costs to consumers, strengthening customer service and reliability, improving customer satisfaction, spurring network investment and fostering greater innovation. For example, the sector continued to reduce the number of power cuts across Great Britain during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. Since privatization, there has been a 50% reduction in the number of customer interruptions and a 60% reduction in the length of customer interruptions.
On the innovation front, the industry accommodated a 60% increase in small-scale generation connections during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. More than 2.8 gigawatts was connected to the electric distribution network over that period. Finally, customer satisfaction is at a record high since RIIO network sector annual reports began tracking these metrics. It's clear from these examples that there is already strong evidence in the first 2 years of RIIO-ED1 that demonstrates the RIIO strategy is on course to deliver on its objectives.
Ultimately, we think the wide range of proposals in the RIIO-2 consultation document offers us an opportunity to help shape the regulation in ways that are supportive of high-performing and innovative networks such as WPD's.
We focused our response to the consultation on 4 key areas: fair returns, incentives, the cost of debt and the cost of equity. Relative to the potential for lower returns on equity, I would point out that we are in a period where the U.K. risk-free rate is negative by approximately 100 basis points. This is about 200 basis points lower than the 10- and 20-year averages. WPD's cost of equity will be set during the electric distribution consultation that will take place in 2020-2021 time frame. By that time, we would expect the risk-free rate to be in positive territory, more in line with historical rates.
In addition, we expect significant opportunities for continued investment throughout the next price-control period as the U.K. continues to advance its initiative related to electrification and infrastructure requirements to support renewable energy resources. And we have ample time to prepare for any changes that could be made for RIIO-ED2 with our business plan submissions not due until the mid-2021 period.
We remain confident in the U.K. regulatory framework and our ability to develop a high-quality plan for the future that will benefit customers and shareowners. The next step in the RIIO-ED2 process is Ofgem's decision regarding the broader RIIO-2 framework consultation, which is expected later this summer following their review of stakeholder responses.
Finally, on the political front, we see an improved environment with Brexit moving forward and radical calls for renationalization beginning to fade. In addition, the pound has strengthened considerably over the past 12 to 18 months, and we have been able to hedge into this strength, as Vince will share in a few moments.
On Slide 6, we provide an example of our RIIO-ED1 execution outlining our strong U.K. incentive performance for the 2017-2018 regulatory period. As you can see, WPD's operating companies once again earned the top 4 rankings in terms of customer satisfaction among all the distribution network operators in the U.K. with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10.
In addition, we achieved more than 70% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, reflecting our continued drive to deliver value for our customers. This translates into future returns for our shareowners as we earned approximately $100 million of incentive revenues for the regulatory period, consistent with our historical performance and our expectations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year.

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings guidance at this point given that we are only through Q1, but we are very confident that we can deliver the midpoint of our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance and are tracking above that midpoint today.
Let's move to Slide 8 for an overview of first quarter segment results. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 over the prior year, driven by strong results at our domestic utilities. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment improved by $0.09 and Kentucky Regulated improved by $0.05 compared to 2017.
Corporate and other was also higher by $0.06, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in Q1 of 2017. These improved domestic earnings were partially offset by expected lower earnings at the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.08.
Before we discuss segment details, I'll review the impact of weather on our Q1 results. Overall, we saw about a $0.02 improvement compared to the prior year due to weather with domestic weather driving a $0.04 improvement from Q1 2017, partially offset by $0.02 of unfavorable weather in the U.K. The U.S. returned to more normal weather in Q1 2018 compared to last year's mild winter temperatures. As a result, our Kentucky operations experienced a 30% increase in heating degree days, while we saw more than a 10% increase in Pennsylvania quarter-over-quarter. Weather was not a significant factor compared to our budget for the first quarter 2018.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period a year ago. This result was driven primarily by higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher peak transmission system demand in 2018, higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes due to weather, lower operation and maintenance expenses due to lower corporate services costs as well as lower payroll, and lower income taxes resulting from the lower federal tax rate from U.S. tax reform.
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Note that for Kentucky, the impact of lower federal tax rate is reflected on the income taxes in other line item with the offset being lower revenues reflected in adjusted gross margins, both being about $0.03.
Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in Q1 2018, an $0.08 decline compared to a year ago. The reduction in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes, driven by a tax benefit that we recorded in Q1 2017 related to accelerated pension contributions that did not recur in 2018, and higher U.K. income taxes due to accelerated tax deductions in Q1 2017. In addition, we experienced lower adjusted gross margins in the U.K., driven by the April 1, 2017, price decrease of $0.01 and lower sales volume of $0.01. The price decrease was due to true-up mechanisms, primarily for interest and inflation, and was partially offset by higher base demand revenue from the normal annual price increases. These lower results were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 12. The pound has continued to show strength versus the U.S. dollar, and we layered on additional hedges since year-end. We have increased our hedge position in 2020 to about 50% at an average rate of $1.49 per pound. The chart on the right shows the trend of improving rates over the past year with the current forward curve continuing to be well above our budgeted rate of $1.40 per pound.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Because as we've talked in the past, FFO carries a lot more weight in the FFO to debt metric than reducing debt does. It's about an 8x multiple on the leverage that you get there. And -- so as we kind of reiterate -- or iterated the plan, we found we were a bit too conservative in the way we modeled some depreciation aspects and how that kind of flowed through the cash flows and the earnings.

And clearly, Ofgem is not going to set that rate for us today. So that rate for us will not be set until roughly 2021. So by that point, we would think that Brexit would be well behind us that the Bank of England would be not fundamentally doing what they've been doing to kind of keep interest rates low, very low and that the situation would improve.

Moving to Slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 first quarter results and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our first quarter 2018 segment earnings results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong first quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.74 per share, up almost 20% from $0.62 per share a year ago. This increase was driven by higher earnings in our U.S. segments, partially offset by expected lower earnings in the U.K. segment.
We performed very well against our business plans in Q1, putting PPL solidly on track to deliver on our 2018 earnings forecast of $2.20 per share to $2.40 per share.
Today, we are also affirming our long-term projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2018 through 2020, off of our 2018 forecast midpoint. In addition, we're updating our expected equity needs.
On our year-end call, we communicated an equity need of between $2 billion and $3 billion from 2018 to 2020. That was approximately $1 billion to $2 billion higher than our prior plans as a result of tax reform. We are now targeting to be near the low end of our previously announced range, driven primarily by revisions to our business plan as we've continued to assess and revise our expectations regarding the impact of tax reform. Achieving our updated equity target would result in an earnings growth rate at the high end of the 5% to 6% range.
Turning to a U.K. regulatory and political update on Slide 5. On April 30, Ofgem announced that they've determined that no mid-period review is necessary for RIIO-ED1. We believe Ofgem through their consultation process arrived at the best outcome for all stakeholders. We appreciated the opportunity to share our views with Ofgem during the consultation phase and that they ultimately decided to adhere to the regulatory construct they developed with the distribution companies.
We believe this is an important signal of support for U.K. regulation, which we continue to view as one of the premier jurisdictions. We look forward to continuing to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners. I should also note that WPD has agreed to voluntarily return to customers GBP 77 million related to the rail electrification project -- projects rather, in WPD's territories that were curtailed by the government in mid-2017. This voluntary return will not have a material impact to PPL and was outside of the scope of the mid-period review. As Ofgem noted, this voluntary return of funds to customers by WPD was a key consideration in their decision not to conduct an extension of the mid-period review. Ofgem also noted that adjusting network returns would damage investor confidence and could increase financing cost for networks. We believe Ofgem's decision is a very positive step for the industry, as it demonstrates that Ofgem understands the need to balance all stakeholders' needs.
In other U.K. regulatory developments, Ofgem released its RIIO-2 framework consultation document on March 7 with yesterday marking the deadline for stake owner responses. As we've stated, the consultation was in line with our expectations, and we believe WPD can continue to provide customer benefits while still meeting shareowner expectations.
Ofgem has determined that the current framework is generally working for customers, and we agree. We shared in our consultation response that our view is that RIIO-1 has worked well so far in controlling costs to consumers, strengthening customer service and reliability, improving customer satisfaction, spurring network investment and fostering greater innovation. For example, the sector continued to reduce the number of power cuts across Great Britain during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. Since privatization, there has been a 50% reduction in the number of customer interruptions and a 60% reduction in the length of customer interruptions.
On the innovation front, the industry accommodated a 60% increase in small-scale generation connections during the 2016-2017 regulatory year. More than 2.8 gigawatts was connected to the electric distribution network over that period. Finally, customer satisfaction is at a record high since RIIO network sector annual reports began tracking these metrics. It's clear from these examples that there is already strong evidence in the first 2 years of RIIO-ED1 that demonstrates the RIIO strategy is on course to deliver on its objectives.
Ultimately, we think the wide range of proposals in the RIIO-2 consultation document offers us an opportunity to help shape the regulation in ways that are supportive of high-performing and innovative networks such as WPD's.
We focused our response to the consultation on 4 key areas: fair returns, incentives, the cost of debt and the cost of equity. Relative to the potential for lower returns on equity, I would point out that we are in a period where the U.K. risk-free rate is negative by approximately 100 basis points. This is about 200 basis points lower than the 10- and 20-year averages. WPD's cost of equity will be set during the electric distribution consultation that will take place in 2020-2021 time frame. By that time, we would expect the risk-free rate to be in positive territory, more in line with historical rates.
In addition, we expect significant opportunities for continued investment throughout the next price-control period as the U.K. continues to advance its initiative related to electrification and infrastructure requirements to support renewable energy resources. And we have ample time to prepare for any changes that could be made for RIIO-ED2 with our business plan submissions not due until the mid-2021 period.
We remain confident in the U.K. regulatory framework and our ability to develop a high-quality plan for the future that will benefit customers and shareowners. The next step in the RIIO-ED2 process is Ofgem's decision regarding the broader RIIO-2 framework consultation, which is expected later this summer following their review of stakeholder responses.
Finally, on the political front, we see an improved environment with Brexit moving forward and radical calls for renationalization beginning to fade. In addition, the pound has strengthened considerably over the past 12 to 18 months, and we have been able to hedge into this strength, as Vince will share in a few moments.
On Slide 6, we provide an example of our RIIO-ED1 execution outlining our strong U.K. incentive performance for the 2017-2018 regulatory period. As you can see, WPD's operating companies once again earned the top 4 rankings in terms of customer satisfaction among all the distribution network operators in the U.K. with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10.
In addition, we achieved more than 70% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, reflecting our continued drive to deliver value for our customers. This translates into future returns for our shareowners as we earned approximately $100 million of incentive revenues for the regulatory period, consistent with our historical performance and our expectations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings",746,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results compared to both last year and compared to budget that positions us well for the remainder of the year. We are not updating our 2018 annual earnings guidance at this point given that we are only through Q1, but we are very confident that we can deliver the midpoint of our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance and are tracking above that midpoint today.
Let's move to Slide 8 for an overview of first quarter segment results. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 over the prior year, driven by strong results at our domestic utilities. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment improved by $0.09 and Kentucky Regulated improved by $0.05 compared to 2017.
Corporate and other was also higher by $0.06, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in Q1 of 2017. These improved domestic earnings were partially offset by expected lower earnings at the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.08.
Before we discuss segment details, I'll review the impact of weather on our Q1 results. Overall, we saw about a $0.02 improvement compared to the prior year due to weather with domestic weather driving a $0.04 improvement from Q1 2017, partially offset by $0.02 of unfavorable weather in the U.K. The U.S. returned to more normal weather in Q1 2018 compared to last year's mild winter temperatures. As a result, our Kentucky operations experienced a 30% increase in heating degree days, while we saw more than a 10% increase in Pennsylvania quarter-over-quarter. Weather was not a significant factor compared to our budget for the first quarter 2018.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period a year ago. This result was driven primarily by higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher peak transmission system demand in 2018, higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes due to weather, lower operation and maintenance expenses due to lower corporate services costs as well as lower payroll, and lower income taxes resulting from the lower federal tax rate from U.S. tax reform.
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Note that for Kentucky, the impact of lower federal tax rate is reflected on the income taxes in other line item with the offset being lower revenues reflected in adjusted gross margins, both being about $0.03.
Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in Q1 2018, an $0.08 decline compared to a year ago. The reduction in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes, driven by a tax benefit that we recorded in Q1 2017 related to accelerated pension contributions that did not recur in 2018, and higher U.K. income taxes due to accelerated tax deductions in Q1 2017. In addition, we experienced lower adjusted gross margins in the U.K., driven by the April 1, 2017, price decrease of $0.01 and lower sales volume of $0.01. The price decrease was due to true-up mechanisms, primarily for interest and inflation, and was partially offset by higher base demand revenue from the normal annual price increases. These lower results were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 12. The pound has continued to show strength versus the U.S. dollar, and we layered on additional hedges since year-end. We have increased our hedge position in 2020 to about 50% at an average rate of $1.49 per pound. The chart on the right shows the trend of improving rates over the past year with the current forward curve continuing to be well above our budgeted rate of $1.40 per pound.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

I think we believe there are benefits to keeping the business mix as it currently stands, as it does diversify our political risk, the macroeconomic risk, and of course, our regulatory risk. Divesting the U.K. either in part or whole continues to be value destructive due to significant tax leakage and some other issues. And we've got a fairly long history of this U.K. business being under a premier regulatory jurisdiction, and I think Ofgem's recent decision not to conduct an MPR further supports that view.

Subsequent to the call, we just went back and continued to refine the analysis with a strong focus on FFO. Because as we've talked in the past, FFO carries a lot more weight in the FFO to debt metric than reducing debt does. It's about an 8x multiple on the leverage that you get there. And -- so as we kind of reiterate -- or iterated the plan, we found we were a bit too conservative in the way we modeled some depreciation aspects and how that kind of flowed through the cash flows and the earnings. That was, to be honest with you, the bulk of it and then there was just a little bit in a bunch of other line items that we found.

If you look historically at the 10- and 20-year averages, it's not been negative except for, really, the last 12 to 18 months. So this is an anomaly that we're seeing. And clearly, Ofgem is not going to set that rate for us today. So that rate for us will not be set until roughly 2021. So by that point, we would think that Brexit would be well behind us that the Bank of England would be not fundamentally doing what they've been doing to kind of keep interest rates low, very low and that the situation would improve. So we think this is a kind of a very temporary period of time and it was really just a comment that the rates are not going to be set today while there's a risk-free rate that's negative.

With me on the quarter today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations is Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of our regulatory developments in the U.K. 
Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. 
As always, we'll give ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we have narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.20 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share -- from $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range posttax reform to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to discipline financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remain strong among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized everyday across all of our operating companies. 
In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution business has achieved top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement of the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, mentored against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. 
In that regard, our utilities continue to strengthen in reliabilities for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for liability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continuing improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are custom to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflects our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which is defined that has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe based on this framework that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareholders alike in RIIO-2. One of the determination of Ofgem is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we are currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers of fortifying 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near terms would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset lives for RAV depreciation. 
Currently, we're transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in an ex-price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority to subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in the RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced shareholder engagement as the substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for project that are new, separable and of high values. We are not concerned that this will negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that will meet those conditions as even the large investment projects tend to be well below the [ EUR 100 million  ]threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareholders. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsectors reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident that WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile year results into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",490,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utility were flat compared to 2017. Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to $1.33 from $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes in the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018 flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of general salaries and had position. Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investment and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales on. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for further question and answer period. Bill?"

I think maybe to start, I would say we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusted the fastpot, slowpot split. Currently, we're at 80%, 20%, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to [indiscernible]. We've talked of additional Capex as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the RIIO-2 initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CTI -- from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as the compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash but against will long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about $180 million to $200 million a year in and pension deficit funding. We do expect using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans that the plans will be fully funded by the end of [ 81.  ]So our expectation is that we will not be collect that amount of revenue from customers in [ 82.  ]That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we will look. And then of course we have the filing that is part of any business plan, process where we can shape the revenues over what looks to be fine year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the confrontation. Some of those may get result in transmission and gas distribution, consultation, some of them may not get the results until [ 82  ]consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually a higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareholder value. And if there was clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. I think our track record shows that we are not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareholders will then benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth but I would say is in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's kind of -- you're getting paid to wait if you want to look at it that way.

But I do believe, it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal and so that will create some political noise, I'm sure around that but that's one data point. In terms of being patient, I think, if you recall, back several years ago when PPL electric utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming up of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that. There were certain shareowners that, that time said we should sell of our Pennsylvania better and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest growth utility option and opportunity. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time. So I think we want to be prudent, patient but also continually assessing what options could create additional value and as I indicated, we're not afraid to take more strategic option if we think it's in the best interest of long-term of the shareowners."

Solar on the other hand has certain potential going down the road. we put in 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very with what we had planned so that's a very good thing as Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our lower growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something else over the course of time, not any lower segments in the near-term.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution business has achieved top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU have also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are custom to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in [the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident that well -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ reporting ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to $1.33 from $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins, [ through ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity [ sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the [ RIIO-2 ] initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million.

But I do believe, it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal and so that will create some political noise, I'm sure around that. But that's one data point. In terms of being patient, I think, if you recall back several years ago when PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming off of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that. There were certain shareowners that at that time said we should sell off our Pennsylvania business and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest growth utility option and opportunity. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time. So I think we want to be prudent and patient but also continually assessing what options could create additional value.

Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution business has achieved top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU have also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are custom to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in [the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident that well -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ reporting ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to $1.33 from $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins, [ through ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity [ sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

We also executed on our financing plan and position the company well, post tax reform. Our excellent customer service and reliability was once again recognized by our customers. 
Finally we received some positive data points looking ahead to RIIO-2 and remain optimistic about the opportunities for WPD in the next price control.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the [ RIIO-2 ] initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

And then additional CapEx that we expect to be spending, so it will be earning a return on that. The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million. Over the whole 8-year period, we would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So that would also provide both cash and earnings' uptick going from 1 to 2."

And we would look to, early next year, there is a summit coming up in October, maybe we'll have some readout from the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU in October. But I do believe, it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal and so that will create some political noise, I'm sure around that. But that's one data point. In terms of being patient, I think, if you recall back several years ago when PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming off of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that. There were certain shareowners that at that time said we should sell off our Pennsylvania business and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest growth utility option and opportunity. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time. So I think we want to be prudent and patient but also continually assessing what options could create additional value. And as I indicated, we're not afraid to take bold strategic action if we think it's in the best interests, long-term of the shareowners."

Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution businesses achieved the top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are [accustomed] to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident [as well] -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ recording ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to a $1.33 from a $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins[ to ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Finally we received some positive data points looking ahead to RIIO-2 and remain optimistic about the opportunities for WPD in the next price control. 
I'm confident that PPL's focus on providing best-in-class operational performance, investing responsibly in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation and developing our people, will deliver value to our customers and our shareowners.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the RIIO-2 initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about a 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about a $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

And then additional CapEx that we expect to be spending, so it will be earning a return on that. The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million. Over the whole 8-year period, we would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So that would also provide both cash and earnings' uptick going from 1 to 2."

That's a positive going into your business plans, in that case for RIIO-ED1. As we look ahead to RIIO-ED2, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer engagement piece, which is somewhat new. We had already put that into our plans for RIIO-ED1, which I think helped justify that ours was a well justified plan. It had input from a broad group of stakeholders.

And we would look to, early next year, there is a summit coming up in October, maybe we'll have some readout from the negotiation between the U.K. and the EU in October. But I do believe, it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal and so that will create some political noise, I'm sure around that. But that's one data point. In terms of being patient, I think, if you recall back several years ago when PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming off of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that. There were certain shareowners that at that time said we should sell off our Pennsylvania business and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest growth utility option and opportunity. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time. So I think we want to be prudent, patient but also continually assessing what options could create additional value. And as I indicated, we're not afraid to take bold strategic action if we think it's in the best interest long-term of the shareowners."

Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in a 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term. So we're open to all of that, trying to provide customer adoptions. But that's how I would quickly describe renewables for us."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution businesses achieved the top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are [accustomed] to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident [as well] -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ recording ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to a $1.33 from a $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins[ to ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past.

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the RIIO-2 initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about a 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about a $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

And then additional CapEx that we expect to be spending, so it will be earning a return on that. The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million. Over the whole 8-year period, we would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So that would also provide both cash and earnings' uptick going from 1 to 2."

That's a positive going into your business plans, in that case for RIIO-ED1. As we look ahead to RIIO-ED2, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer engagement piece, which is somewhat new. We had already put that into our plans for RIIO-ED1, which I think helped justify that ours was a well justified plan. It had input from a broad group of stakeholders.

Well, Brexit is clearly driving a lot of the political instability and which is having and has had a knock on effect in several ways to the regulator Ofgem in this case. And we would look to, early next year, there is a summit coming up in October, maybe we'll have some readout from the negotiation between the U.K. and the EU in October. But I do believe, it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal and so that will create some political noise, I'm sure around that. But that's one data point. In terms of being patient, I think, if you recall back several years ago when PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming off of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that. There were certain shareowners that at that time said we should sell off our Pennsylvania business and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest growth utility option and opportunity. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time. So I think we want to be prudent, patient but also continually assessing what options could create additional value. And as I indicated, we're not afraid to take bold strategic action if we think it's in the best interest long-term of the shareowners."

And so if we were to go down that path in the future, it would likely entail transmission to other states. But for now we just don't see that in the near geography of our service territory. Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in a 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term. So we're open to all of that, trying to provide customer adoptions. But that's how I would quickly describe renewables for us."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution businesses achieved the top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are [accustomed] to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident [as well] -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ recording ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to a $1.33 from a $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins[ to ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision",506,"Sure. So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the RIIO-2 initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about a 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about a $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million. Over the whole 8-year period, we would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So that would also provide both cash and earnings' uptick going from 1 to 2."

That's a positive going into your business plans, in that case for RIIO-ED1. As we look ahead to RIIO-ED2, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer engagement piece, which is somewhat new. We had already put that into our plans for RIIO-ED1, which I think helped justify that ours was a well justified plan. It had input from a broad group of stakeholders.

Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in a 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, head of our operations at Western Power Distribution in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results, and a brief review of regulatory developments in the U.K. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our U.K. segment. 
On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint from $2.33 per share from -- to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform. 
In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO-to-debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range, post tax reform, to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. 
In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remains strong, among the very best in the regions they serve. 
In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power Awards for residential customer satisfaction in July. Achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. 
I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. 
Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power Awards. 
At the same time, in the U.K., our Western Power Distribution businesses achieved the top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year run. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 5. PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. 
Over the past 7 years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio, our regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the U.K., we've made significant improvements and reliability across each of our service territories. 
PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. 
LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017 with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over 6 years from the 2010, 2011 performance period to the 2016, 2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's 4 distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011. 
The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards, we are [accustomed] to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success. 
Turning to Slide 6, for a U.K. regulatory update. Last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of -- has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe, based on this framework, that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2. One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a 5-year price control period, a reduction from the 8-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. 
While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an 8-year period, we have no concerns with the 5-year price control period. We previously had 5-year price controls and performed well under that framework. Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. 
Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term. 
Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plans. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also noted that while fast tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. 
As a reminder, WPD's 4 networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast tracked under RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups, designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users. WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. 
Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control. 
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We are not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that we meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the GBP 100 million threshold set by Ofgem. 
In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020. 
We remain confident [as well] -- WPD is well-positioned given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future, and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results, into and throughout the next price control. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0",494,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. 
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The U.K. Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of [ recording ] annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather primarily in Kentucky. 
Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the U.K. are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 9. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2, 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to a $1.33 from a $1.21 per pound. Higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. 
Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from the U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform. Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins[ to ] higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision",506,"Sure. So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included adjusting the fast pot, slow pot split. Currently, we're at 80-20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to fast pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. and that's been reaffirmed by the U.K. government with the RIIO-2 initiative. We also -- we talked about this briefly, but the move from CPI -- sorry, from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows in earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as your -- as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about a 100 basis points less than RPI. So Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as you -- as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth. You mentioned pension deficit funding. So we are collecting about a $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect, using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans, that the plans will be fully funded by the end of ED1. So our expectation is that we will not need to collect that amount of revenue from customers in ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would [ like ]. And then of course we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the -- what looks to be a 5-year period going into RIIO-2. So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period. So it's hard to say right now, if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher cash flows from the U.K. business in RIIO-2 than we are seeing in RIIO-1. But again, I still think we need to -- we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, well, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis."

First, I would say the management team and the board is very open-minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareowner value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long term. I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the U.K. is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. 
I think in the near term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value for customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well. 
In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth, but what I would say is that in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's a kind of a -- you're getting paid to wait, if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options and if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that.

The other important aspect that we've talked about in the past is, based on the way, we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million. Over the whole 8-year period, we would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So that would also provide both cash and earnings' uptick going from 1 to 2."

That's a positive going into your business plans, in that case for RIIO-ED1. As we look ahead to RIIO-ED2, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer engagement piece, which is somewhat new. We had already put that into our plans for RIIO-ED1, which I think helped justify that ours was a well justified plan. It had input from a broad group of stakeholders. So I think those are the types of things that Ofgem would look to see from a company.

And so if we were to go down that path in the future, it would likely entail transmission to other states. But for now we just don't see that in the near geography of our service territory. Solar on the other hand has certainly potential going down the road. We've put in a 10-megawatt facility at the Brown station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant, very -- congruent with what we had planned, so that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our low growth is not projected to be strong and therefore the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term.

Moving to Slide 3. Given, we will see many of you at EI in little over a week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. 
Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. 
Vince will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer questions at the end. 
Turning to Slide 4, today we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share resulting in a total of $2.01 per share to the first 9 months of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments. 
Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. 
In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps that are gas and electric and Kentucky Utilities business to support infrastructure investment that benefit our customers. 
LG&E and KU filed rate request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas base rate. 
A more detailed breakdown of our rate request can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increase that will support continued monitorization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrade to LG&E natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and to minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes the proposed green tariff aimed at [indiscernible] renewal energy growth and economic development in Kentucky. 
The green tariff will roll LG&E and KU existing green energy program and solar offerings into 1 tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options. 
If approved by the commission, LG&E and KU requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. 
Even with the increase associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national average. 
Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide in a key year liability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. 
The report issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers down PPL electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest average frequency of utilities tracked in the middle land region. 
It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequency according to the same report. This achievement reflects the value of PPL electric's continued investment in the smart grid technology, powerline upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. 
The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction. 
In the area of power quality and reliability for example, PPL Electric Utilities ranked third in customer satisfaction in recent national survey. These are just a couple of examples of the excellent operational performance we continue to demonstrate across all of our businesses. And it's that strong performance that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to deliver both competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners. With that, I'll now turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results.

Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. 
PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania segment. 
As a result of the warmer weather during the third quarter, we saw higher volumes in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher income tax expenses, which includes the timing impact of the recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings are $0.18 higher than the prior year due to higher adjusted gross margins in our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in pension income in the U.K. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has now contributed $0.11 of favorable earnings per share versus the prior year and $0.07 favorable compared to our original forecast. 
I'll also note that in September, we drew down approximately $520 million from the May equity forward transaction resulting in a total of $0.04 of dilution year-to-date versus last year. 
We expect to draw the remaining portion of the equity in 2019. 
And as Bill mentioned, PPL's continued strong performance in 2018 enables us to narrowed the guidance range and increase the midpoint to $2.35 per share. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 7. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.30 per share in Q3, 2018, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate for Q3 '18 was $1.34 per pound compared to $1.18 per pound in Q3 '17. 
Higher adjusted gross margins due to the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. 
These positive drivers were partially offset by a dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Pennsylvania on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.03 increase versus a year ago. 
Excluding the impact on margins from lower income tax recovery, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margin of about $0.03 per share due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales, primarily due to weather. 
The positive margins were partially offset by higher depreciation from additional utility plant addition. 
Consistent with prior quarters this year, our results reflected offsetting variances due to the estimated income tax savings for our customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in both adjusted gross margins and income taxes of $0.04. 
Moving to Kentucky, on Slide 9, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. Excluding the impact on margins from lower income tax recovery, Kentucky's adjusted gross margin was higher by about $0.02 from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather and returns on additional environmental capital investment. 
This positive variance was more than offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Similar to our Pennsylvania segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.04 per share due to tax reform. That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Ali, I think as it relates to earnings guidance beyond 2020, I think the CapEx's rate base projections are a good base line to start with. But there are other considerations that we need to take into account, obviously, interest rates, taxes, foreign currency. Pensions are a big one as well. When we look at the pension plans in the U.K., they are performing quite well from a return perspective, and we have our upcoming review with the pension regulator in March of '19. That takes some time to get through but that will ultimately determine how much pension deficit revenues we will be correcting post March of 2021. So all of those things, we will continue to monitor and at the appropriate time. I think that guidance."

And it does seem that our take is that you will ultimately probably get done, but we'll know one way or the other here in the next few months on that. I think we're also seeing positive commentary around the value that the networks have been providing to consumers in the U.K. both in terms of lower cost, better customer service. And I think there's a growing recognition in the U.K. that they are having great benefits from privatization, particularly, of the electric network. So I think -- I sense that things are moving in a more positive direction on that front. So I think for now, as I said previously, we're always open to strategic options that will create value for shareowners. 
But at this time, we don't see any of those adding shareowners values. So we're going to continue to focus on the strong business plan, and we have high growth in EPS relative to the peers. And I think there's no need for us to make any dramatic moves at this point."

Given that this is pending litigation, this is what I'll say regarding that. We flatly disagree with talent. We're confident we acted appropriately in all the transaction that's related to sale of PPL Montana, hydroelectric, generating assets or the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business. 
And further, we believe that PPL Montana was solve in upon distribution of those proceeds. 
It's been more than 5 years since the sale of Hydro assets were announced and almost 4 years since sale was completed. 
Under the separation agreement, related to the spinoff of PPS competitive generation business in June of 2015, you may recall that [indiscernible] Energy and affiliates of Riverstone, which is a private investment firm that acquired 35% of town in the spin and later took down private. Definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain these proceeds from the sale of the Hydro asset. 
I don't think that is in any way in question. At all times prior to the spinoff, we operated PPL Montana in a prudent manner consistent within industry standards and PPL had no control or responsibility for what happened to the company after the spin. 
These businesses and all associated to assets and liabilities belong entirely to talent and its owner of Riverstone. Regarding the issue of pension obligations raised by talent, I think it's worth noting that PPL's pension liability related to the Montana pension assets was nearly fully funded at the time of the spinoff of PPL energy supply, in fact, it was 96% funded. And we ensured this when PPL made a large contribution to the PPL Montana pension fund prior to the Spin transaction. So overall, we're very proud of the record we have established in maintaining and operating PPL Montana assets of our environmental stewardship including expensive environmental upgrades that we did at Cold strip and of our efforts to strengthen communities during our time in Montana. 
In summary, we're going to defend ourselves very vigorously against any of these claims."

And so while labor continues to speak of renationalization, it's clear that real water and mail are the areas of focus. Relative to energy, there's been little detail about how any type of renationalization may be accomplished, and whether distribution networks are even a target this point.

Moving to Slide 3. Given, we will see many of you at EEI in little over a week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. 
Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2018 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. Vince will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions at the end. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share resulting in a total of $2.01 per share through the first 9 months of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments.  Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. 
In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities  businesses that support continued infrastructure investment that benefit our customers. 
LG&E and KU filed rate request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas base rate. 
A more detailed breakdown of our rate request can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increases will support continued monitorization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrade to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and to minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes a proposed Green Tariff aimed at spurring renewal energy growth and economic development in Kentucky. The green tariff will roll LG&E and KU's existing green energy program and solar offerings into 1 tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options.
If approved by the commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. 
Even with the increase associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national average. 
Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities' ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide in a key reliability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. 
The report issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers down PPL electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest outage frequency of utility is tracked in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequency according to the same report. This achievement reflects the value of PPL electric's continued investments in its Smart Grid technology, powerline upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. 
The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction. 
In the area of power quality and reliability for example, PPL Electric Utilities ranked third in customer satisfaction in recent national survey. These are just a couple of examples of the excellent operational performance we continue to demonstrate across all of our businesses. And it's that strong performance that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to deliver both competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners. With that, I'll now turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in th",596,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. 
PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania segment. 
As a result of a warmer weather during the third quarter, we saw higher volumes in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher income tax expenses, which includes the timing impact of the recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings are $0.18 higher than the prior year due to higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in pension income in the U.K. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has now contributed $0.11 of favorable earnings per share versus the prior year and $0.07 favorable compared to our original forecast. 
I'll also note that in September, we drew down approximately $520 million from the May equity forward transaction resulting in a total of $0.04 of dilution year-to-date versus last year. We expect to draw the remaining portion of the equity in 2019. And as Bill mentioned, PPL's continued strong performance in 2018 enables us to narrow the guidance range and increase the midpoint to $2.35 per share. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 7. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.30 per share in Q3, 2018, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate for Q3 '18 was $1.34 per pound compared to $1.18 per pound in Q3 '17. Higher adjusted gross margins due to the April 1, 2018, price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Pennsylvania on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.03 increase versus a year ago. 
Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margin of about $0.03 per share due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales, primarily due to weather. The positive margins were partially offset by higher depreciation from additional utility plant addition. 
Consistent with prior quarters this year, our results reflected offsetting variance due to the estimated income tax savings for our customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in both adjusted gross margins and income taxes of $0.04. 
Moving to Kentucky, on Slide 9. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, Kentucky's adjusted gross margin was higher by about $0.02 from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather and returns on additional environmental capital investment. 
This positive variance was more than offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Similar to our Pennsylvania segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.04 per share due to the tax reform. That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

The pound continues -- really from a historical perspective, it's trading at net historical lows. And we think it makes sense, and we can afford to be patient as we've kind of think through the hedging strategy here. We talked last quarter about -- because we hedged so much in 2018 and '19 and half of '20, that we were actually outside of the bands of our risk management guidelines, and so we've kind of worked our way back into those bands due to completion of third quarter into October. So I would expect that we'll start to layer on hedges to be more consistent with our historical practices in -- with our risk management policy. But we don't see if any -- today, to load up on a lot of hedging in the out years at this rate."

Ali, I think as it relates to earnings guidance beyond 2020, I think the CapEx rate base projections are a good base line to start with. But there are other considerations that we need to take into account, obviously, interest rates, taxes, foreign currency, pensions are a big one as well. When we look at the pension plans in the U.K., they are performing quite well from a return perspective, and we have our upcoming review with the pension regulator in March of '19. That takes some time to get through but that will ultimately determine how much pension deficit revenues we will be collecting post March of 2021. So all of those things, we will continue to monitor and at the appropriate time, provided I think that guidance."

I think we're also seeing positive commentary around the value that the networks have been providing to consumers in the U.K. both in terms of lower cost, better customer service. And I think there's a growing recognition in the U.K. that there have been great benefits from privatization, particularly, of the electric network. So I think -- I sense that things are moving in a more positive direction on that front. So I think for now, as I said previously, we're always open to strategic options that would create value for shareowners. 
But at this time, we don't see any of those adding shareowner value so. So we're going to continue to focus on the strong business plan that we have for high growth in EPS relative to the peers. And I think there's no need for us to make any dramatic moves at this point."

Given that this is pending litigations, this is what I'll say regarding that. We flatly disagree with Talent but we're confident we acted appropriately in all the transactions related to either the sale of PPL's Montana, hydroelectric, generating assets or the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business. 
And further, we believe that PPL Montana was solving upon distribution of those proceeds. It's been more than 5 years since the sale of the Hydro assets were announced and almost 4 years since the sale was completed. 
Under the separation agreement, related to the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business in June of 2015, you may recall that Talent Energy and affiliates of Riverstone, which is a private investment firm that acquired 35% of Talent in the spin and later took Talent private. Definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain these proceeds from the sale of the Hydro asset. 
I don't think that is in any way in question. At all times prior to the spinoff, we operated PPL Montana in a prudent manner consistent within industry standards and PPL had no control or responsibility for what happened to the company after the spin. 
These businesses and all associated to assets and liabilities belong entirely to Talent and its owner of Riverstone. Regarding the issue of pension obligations raised by talent, I think it's worth noting that PPL's pension liability related to the Montana pension assets was nearly fully funded at the time of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, in fact, it was 96% funded. And we ensured this when PPL made a large contribution to the PPL Montana pension fund prior to the spin transaction. So overall, we're very proud of the record we've established in maintaining and operating PPL Montana assets of our environmental stewardship including expensive environmental upgrades that we did at Coldstrip and of our efforts to strengthen communities during our time in Montana. In summary, we're going to defend ourselves very vigorously against any of these claims."

And so while labor continues to speak of renationalization, it's clear that Real water and mail are the areas of focus. Relative to energy, there's been little detail about how any type of renationalization might be accomplished, and whether distribution networks are even a target this point.

Moving to Slide 3. Given we will see many of you at EEI in little over a week we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. 
Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2018 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. Vince will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions at the end. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share resulting in a total of $2.01 per share through the first 9 months of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments.  Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. 
In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities  businesses that support continued infrastructure investment that benefit our customers. 
LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas base rate. 
A more detailed breakdown of our rate request can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increases will support continued monitorization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and to minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes a proposed Green Tariff aimed at spurring renewable energy growth and economic development in Kentucky. The Green ariff will roll LG&E and KU's existing green energy program and solar offerings into 1 tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options.
If approved by the commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. 
Even with the increases associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national average. 
Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide in a key reliability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. 
The report, issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, found PPL Electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest outage frequency of utilities tracked in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequencies according to the same report. This achievement reflects the value of PPL Electric's continued investments in its Smart Grid technology, powerline upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. 
The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction. 
In the area of power quality and reliability for example, PPL Electric Utilities ranked third in customer satisfaction in a recent national survey. These are just a couple of examples of the excellent operational performance we continue to demonstrate across all of our businesses. And it's that strong performance that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to deliver both competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners. With that, I'll now turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

          Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. 
PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania segment. 
As a result of the warmer weather during the third quarter, we saw higher volumes in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher income tax expenses, which includes the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings are $0.18 higher than the prior year due to higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in pension income in the U.K. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has now contributed $0.11 of favorable earnings per share versus the prior year and $0.07 favorable compared to our original forecast. 
I'll also note that in September, we drew down approximately $520 million from the May equity forward transaction, resulting in a total of $0.04 of dilution year-to-date versus last year. We expect to draw the remaining portion of the equity in 2019. And as Bill mentioned, PPL's continued strong performance in 2018 enables us to narrow the guidance range and increase the midpoint to $2.35 per share. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 7. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.30 per share in Q3 2018, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate for Q3 '18 was $1.34 per pound compared to $1.18 per pound in Q3 '17. Higher adjusted gross margins due to the April 1, 2018, price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Pennsylvania on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.03 increase versus a year ago. 
Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins of about $0.03 per share due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales, primarily due to weather. The positive margins were partially offset by higher depreciation from additional utility plant addition. 
Consistent with prior quarters this year, our results reflect an offsetting variance due to the estimated income tax savings for our customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in both adjusted gross margins and income taxes of $0.04. 
Moving to Kentucky, on Slide 9. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, Kentucky's adjusted gross margin was higher by about $0.02 from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather and returns on additional environmental capital investment. 
This positive variance was more than offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Similar to our Pennsylvania segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.04 per share due to tax reform. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

          Sure, Ali. You are correct, we haven't added additional hedges during the quarter. The pound continues -- really from a historical perspective, it's trading at net historical lows. And we think it makes sense, and we can afford to be patient as we've kind of think through the hedging strategy here. We talked last quarter about -- because we hedged so much in 2018 and '19 and half of '20, that we were actually outside of the bands of our risk management guidelines, and so we've kind of worked our way back into those bands due to completion of third quarter into October. So I would expect that we'll start to layer on hedges to be more consistent with our historical practices in -- with our risk management policy. But we don't see the need today to load up on a lot of hedging in the out years at this rate."

Ali, I think as it relates to earnings guidance beyond 2020, I think the CapEx rate base projections are a good baseline to start with. But there are other considerations that we need to take into account, obviously, interest rates, taxes, foreign currency, pensions are a big one as well. When we look at the pension plans in the U.K., they are performing quite well from a return perspective, and we have our upcoming review with the pension regulator in March of '19. That takes some time to get through but that will ultimately determine how much pension deficit revenues we will be collecting post March of 2021. So all of those things, we will continue to monitor and at the appropriate time, provide I think that guidance."

And it does seem that our take is that a deal will ultimately probably get done, but we'll know one way or the other here in the next few months on that. I think we're also seeing positive commentary around the value that the networks have been providing to consumers in the U.K. both in terms of lower cost, better customer service. And I think there's a growing recognition in the U.K. that there have been great benefits from privatization, particularly of the electric network. So I think -- I sense that things are moving in a more positive direction on that front. So I think for now, as I said previously, we're always open to strategic options that would create value for shareowners. 
But at this time, we don't see any of those adding shareowner value so. So we're going to continue to focus on the strong business plan that we have for high growth in EPS relative to the peers. And I think there's no need for us to make any dramatic moves at this point."

          Sure. Given that this is pending litigations, this is what I'll say regarding that. We flatly disagree with Talen but we're confident we acted appropriately in all the transactions related to either the sale of PPL's Montana, hydroelectric, generating assets or the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business. 
And further, we believe that PPL Montana was solvent upon distribution of those proceeds. It's been more than 5 years since the sale of the Hydro assets were announced and almost 4 years since the sale was completed. 
Under the separation agreement, related to the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business in June of 2015, you may recall that Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone, which is a private investment firm that acquired 35% of Talen in the spin and later took Talen private, definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain these proceeds from the sale of the Hydro asset. 
I don't think that is in any way in question. At all times prior to the spinoff, we operated PPL Montana in a prudent manner consistent within industry standards and PPL had no control or responsibility for what happened to the company after the spin. 
These businesses and all associated to assets and liabilities belong entirely to Talen and its owner, Riverstone. Regarding the issue of pension obligations raised by Talen, I think it's worth noting that PPL's pension liability related to the Montana pension assets was nearly fully funded at the time of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, in fact, it was 96% funded. And we ensured this when PPL made a large contribution to the PPL Montana pension fund prior to the spin transaction. So overall, we're very proud of the record we established in maintaining and operating PPL Montana assets of our environmental stewardship including expensive environmental upgrades that we did at Colstrip and of our efforts to strengthen communities during our time in Montana. In summary, we're going to defend ourselves very vigorously against any of these claims."

          So not anything I would say earth shattering or, very significant, but I think what my perspective is, just to give you a little flavor on this is, our senior team and our Board of Directors were in England last week and we had some very productive discussions with members of Parliament, Ofgem and some of our external political and legal advisers. And my takeaway was there is growing recognition and understanding that the electric distribution networks have performed very well under privatization and probably importantly that there's recognition that these networks are key to delivering on governments' green agendas. And so while labor continues to speak of renationalization, it's clear that rail, water and the mail are the areas of focus. Relative to energy, there's been little detail about how any type of renationalization might be accomplished, and whether distribution networks are even a target this point.

Moving to Slide 3. Given we will see many of you at EEI in little over a week we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. 
Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2018 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. Vince will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions at the end. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share resulting in a total of $2.01 per share through the first 9 months of 2018. 
Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments. Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. 
In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses that support continued infrastructure investment that benefit our customers. 
LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas base rate. 
A more detailed breakdown of our rate request can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increases will support continued monitorization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and to minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes a proposed Green Tariff aimed at spurring renewable energy growth and economic development in Kentucky. The Green Tariff will roll LG&E and KU's existing green energy program and solar offerings into 1 tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options.
If approved by the commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. 
Even with the increases associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national average. 
Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide in a key reliability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. 
The report, issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, found PPL Electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest outage frequency of utilities tracked in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequencies according to the same report. This achievement reflects the value of PPL Electric's continued investments in its Smart Grid technology, powerline upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. 
The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction. 
In the area of power quality and reliability, for example, PPL Electric Utilities ranked third in customer satisfaction in a recent national survey. These are just a couple of examples of the excellent operational performance we continue to demonstrate across all of our businesses. And it's that strong performance that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to deliver both competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners. With that, I'll now turn it over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results.

Let's begin on Slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. 
PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania segment. 
As a result of the warmer weather during the third quarter, we saw higher volumes in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter compared to 2017. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher income tax expenses, which includes the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings are $0.18 higher than the prior year due to higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in pension income in the U.K. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather has now contributed $0.11 of favorable earnings per share versus the prior year and $0.07 favorable compared to our original forecast. 
I'll also note that in September, we drew down approximately $520 million from the May equity forward transaction, resulting in a total of $0.04 of dilution year-to-date versus last year. We expect to draw the remaining portion of the equity in 2019. And as Bill mentioned, PPL's continued strong performance in 2018 enables us to narrow the guidance range and increase the midpoint to $2.35 per share. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 7. 
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.30 per share in Q3 2018, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate for Q3 '18 was $1.34 per pound compared to $1.18 per pound in Q3 '17. Higher adjusted gross margins due to the April 1, 2018, price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Pennsylvania on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.03 increase versus a year ago. 
Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins of about $0.03 per share due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales, primarily due to weather. The positive margins were partially offset by higher depreciation from additional utility plant addition. 
Consistent with prior quarters this year, our results reflect an offsetting variance due to the estimated income tax savings for our customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in both adjusted gross margins and income taxes of $0.04. 
Moving to Kentucky, on Slide 9. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, Kentucky's adjusted gross margin was higher by about $0.02 from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather and returns on additional environmental capital investment. 
This positive variance was more than offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Similar to our Pennsylvania segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.04 per share due to tax reform. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

The pound continues -- really from a historical perspective, it's trading at net historical lows. And we think it makes sense, and we can afford to be patient as we've kind of think through the hedging strategy here. We talked last quarter about -- because we hedged so much in 2018 and '19 and half of '20, that we were actually outside of the bands of our risk management guidelines, and so we've kind of worked our way back into those bands due to completion of third quarter into October. So I would expect that we'll start to layer on hedges to be more consistent with our historical practices in -- with our risk management policy.

Ali, I think as it relates to earnings guidance beyond 2020, I think the CapEx rate base projections are a good baseline to start with. But there are other considerations that we need to take into account, obviously, interest rates, taxes, foreign currency, pensions are a big one as well. When we look at the pension plans in the U.K., they are performing quite well from a return perspective, and we have our upcoming review with the pension regulator in March of '19. That takes some time to get through but that will ultimately determine how much pension deficit revenues we will be collecting post March of 2021. So all of those things, we will continue to monitor and at the appropriate time, provide I think that guidance."

And it does seem that our take is that a deal will ultimately probably get done, but we'll know one way or the other here in the next few months on that. I think we're also seeing positive commentary around the value that the networks have been providing to consumers in the U.K. both in terms of lower cost, better customer service. And I think there's a growing recognition in the U.K. that there have been great benefits from privatization, particularly of the electric network. So I think -- I sense that things are moving in a more positive direction on that front. So I think for now, as I said previously, we're always open to strategic options that would create value for shareowners. 
But at this time, we don't see any of those adding shareowner value so. So we're going to continue to focus on the strong business plan that we have for high growth in EPS relative to the peers. And I think there's no need for us to make any dramatic moves at this point."

Given that this is pending litigations, this is what I'll say regarding that. We flatly disagree with Talen but we're confident we acted appropriately in all the transactions related to either the sale of PPL's Montana, hydroelectric, generating assets or the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business. 
And further, we believe that PPL Montana was solvent upon distribution of those proceeds. It's been more than 5 years since the sale of the Hydro assets were announced and almost 4 years since the sale was completed. 
Under the separation agreement, related to the spinoff of PPL's competitive generation business in June of 2015, you may recall that Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone, which is a private investment firm that acquired 35% of Talen in the spin and later took Talen private, definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain these proceeds from the sale of the Hydro asset. 
I don't think that is in any way in question. At all times prior to the spinoff, we operated PPL Montana in a prudent manner consistent within industry standards and PPL had no control or responsibility for what happened to the company after the spin. 
These businesses and all associated to assets and liabilities belong entirely to Talen and its owner, Riverstone. Regarding the issue of pension obligations raised by Talen, I think it's worth noting that PPL's pension liability related to the Montana pension assets was nearly fully funded at the time of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, in fact, it was 96% funded. And we ensured this when PPL made a large contribution to the PPL Montana pension fund prior to the spin transaction. So overall, we're very proud of the record we established in maintaining and operating PPL Montana assets of our environmental stewardship including expensive environmental upgrades that we did at Colstrip and of our efforts to strengthen communities during our time in Montana. In summary, we're going to defend ourselves very vigorously against any of these claims."

And my takeaway was there is growing recognition and understanding that the electric distribution networks have performed very well under privatization and probably importantly that there's recognition that these networks are key to delivering on governments' green agendas. And so while labor continues to speak of renationalization, it's clear that rail, water and the mail are the areas of focus. Relative to energy, there's been little detail about how any type of renationalization might be accomplished, and whether distribution networks are even a target this point.
