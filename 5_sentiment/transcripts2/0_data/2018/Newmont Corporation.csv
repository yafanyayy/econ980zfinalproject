I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. Before we get into th",1302,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all costs, capital and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on 4 continents and demonstrating that leading financial, social and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand. 
Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on Slide 4. Highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution, which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining cost at $924 per ounce with support from our full potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results; increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added the first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon; and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest work at the greatest value. 
We also strengthened our global portfolio of long life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely, on time and on budget, advancing 5 projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets, replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana and across the Andes. 
Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. 
I'll expand on that topic on Slide 5. We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017. We also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks which, along with training, help keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards. As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 in the previous 5 years, but the same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. 
It was an honor to be recognized at the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017 and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's top 250 best managed companies. Newmont was also ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. 
Our teams are also differentiated by their project deliveries record. Turning to Slide 6. Over the last 3 years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region. In North America, we approved the twin underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion in Subika Underground mine, which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led the government -- led to the government extending tax and royalties stability for another 5 years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. And most recently in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power project to a lower cost and emissions and facilitate future growth. We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground and Subika Underground this year. The 6 projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our 5-year guidance reflects cost and production improvement from our full potential work as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. [indiscernible] the highlights, our cost are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower-cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations. Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, and we expect to improve production and operating cost in the outer years for projects that have not yet been approved. 
We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and '19 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects, which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin, and we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha, where we added resources in 2017. 
We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritica project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Asana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. 
Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions. Turning to Slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold prices as the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources, exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the ISC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions are primarily North America and Australia and our resource additions were spread more equally across our 4 regions. Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington, 800,000 ounces at Carlin underground and Cripple Creek & Victor, 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge, 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration and delivering these exceptional results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."
291795,549169699,1398825,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prior",986,"Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. 
Compared to the prior year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion and this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We adjusted -- we increase adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million, and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million. 
I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on Slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impacts Newmont in just a moment. 
Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see that adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. 
We also delivered exceptional results for the full year, turning to Slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increase adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% at $22.7 billion.  Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion. 
Turning to adjustments the full year earnings per share in Slide 14. Here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investment; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. 
These results helped Newmont maintained of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Turning to Slide 15. We worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our 3 capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improved margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013 and, in the fourth quarter, further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3x. Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend. Turning to Slide 16. In December, we announced plans to deal [indiscernible] dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least [ 50%. ] Earlier this week, we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly 3x higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. $0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North America senior gold producer average of approximately 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns while continuing to invest in profitable growth. 
In addition to approving the dividend increase our Board of Directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year. 
Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on Slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover 4 primary aspects. First, we expect to reduce income tax rates to benefit our North America operations starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and cost. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont. In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. 
There are, however, 2 onetime noncash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Remeasurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We'll keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses. 
And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights starting on Slide 18."

We delivered solid performance in 2017 while continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore body modeling, planning and execution; increasing mill throughput and recovery; and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us deliver more than $400 million in full potential improvements and offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events. 
Turning to North America on Slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining costs below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stove design, allowing us to ramp up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus, and can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and will reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019. 
At Twin Creeks, we mined the first production stove at our new underground mine 1 month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a full year layback in the mega pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally plan to mine this layback for the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned. 
We signed a new 7-year [ 12 million ] agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks [indiscernible] close and approved funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project. The project centers on sinking a production skinking chart that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit and improve production rates and unit cost when it comes online in 2022. 
At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course and we expect to complete the environmental impact statement process of the 2018 and '19. 
Turning to South America on Slide 20. Our operations turn the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce. Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched full potential with initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our near primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year. 
At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieve its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed in Quecher Main and we began stripping in the mine, and we continue to advance our Yanacocha Sulfides studies. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 21. The region continue to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we are beginning a layback of our existing Subika service mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional Leach, thanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stove at the Subika Underground mine and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs arose as expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, we continue to advance our growth regional growth studies, which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion safely, on budget and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stove design resulting in high grades, and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity. 
At KCGM, we continue to remediate a slip in the West wall of the [indiscernible] pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2018. We delayed approval timing so we can combine 2 permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule. We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter this year and deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput 4x in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in South pit. Mine plan optimization at Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. 
We've also approved a new project at Tanami to support continued expansion. Turning to Slide 23. Our Tanami Power project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to site by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We've contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and 2 on-site power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. Our capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers the lease that will be paid over a 10-year period, and the project is expected to generate a national rate of return greater than 50%. 
Looking to the year ahead on Slide 24. For 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit cost and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing full potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and planned maintenance shutdowns results in second half weighting with our highest production at lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year and execute our planned maintenance, annual planned maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. We then expect to ramp up production in the third quarter as we begin the process Silverstar ore and reach higher grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with the Subika Underground coming online in both South American operations reaching high grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we'll use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary"

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia and we continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by our new mine growth prospects. Turning to Slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance to execution in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins. 
Turning to Slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our current guidance, and the dark blue layer shows the 2 long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance. 
Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
As does our leading reserve profile. Turning to Slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stop investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. The same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and positions the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

You'll certainly see in Merian as we work through our stripping campaign in the first half to 3 quarters, it will reach some high-grade ores at Merian [indiscernible] and quite weighted to the second half. Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, around Ahafo as we're in the Subika layback at the open pit at Ahafo. We'll get into some high-grade ores at Subika.

I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. Before we get into",1303,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. 
Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all cost, capital, and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on 4 continents, and demonstrating that leading financial, social and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand. 
Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on Slide 4. Highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution, which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining cost at $924 per ounce, with support from our full potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results; increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added a first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon; and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest [ work ] adds the greatest value. 
We also strengthened our global portfolio of long life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely, on time and on budget, advancing 5 projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets, replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana and across the Andes. 
Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile, and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. I'll expand on that topic on Slide 5. 
We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017. We also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks which, along with training, help keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards. As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 and the previous 5 years, with same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. 
It was an honor to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017, and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's Top 250 Best Managed Companies. Newmont was also ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in the areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. 
Our teams also differentiated by their project delivery record, turning to Slide 6. Over the last 3 years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region. 
In North America, we approved the twin underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground mine, which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led the government -- led to the government extending tax and royalty stability for another 5 years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. 
And most recently, in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power project to lower cost and emissions, and facilitate future growth. We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground, and Subika Underground this year. The 6 projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 7. Our 5-year guidance reflects cost and production improvements from our full potential work as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. Covering the highlights, our costs are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower-cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations. Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, and we expect to improve production and operating cost in the outer years through projects that have not yet been approved. 
We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and '19 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects, which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin, and we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha, where we added resources in 2017. 
We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritica project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. 
Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions, turning to Slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces, and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold price as the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources, exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. 
As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the IFC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions were primarily in North America and Australia, and our resource additions were spread more equally across our 4 regions. 
Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington, 800,000 ounces at Carlin underground and Cripple Creek & Victor, 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge, 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these exceptional results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prio",988,"Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. 
Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prior year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion and this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We adjusted -- we increased adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million, and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million. 
I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on Slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impact Newmont in just a moment. 
Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation and remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets, and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see the adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. 
We also delivered exceptional results for the full year, turning to Slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increase adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% at $22.7 billion.  Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion.
Turning to adjustments, to full year earnings per share on Slide 14. Here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investments; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. 
These results helped Newmont maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Turning to Slide 15. We've worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our 3 capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improved margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013, and in the fourth quarter, further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3x. Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend. Turning to Slide 16. In December, we announced plans to de-link our dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least 50%. Earlier this week, we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly 3x higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. 
$0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North American senior gold producer average of approximately 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns, while continuing to invest in profitable growth.
In addition to approving a dividend increase our Board of Directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year.
Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on Slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover 4 primary aspects here. First, we expect to reduce income tax rate to benefit our North America operations starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and costs. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont. In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. 
There are, however, 2 onetime noncash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Remeasurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses.
And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights, starting on Slide 18."

We delivered solid performance in 2017 by continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore body modeling; mine planning and execution; increasing mill throughput and recovery; and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us deliver more than $400 million in full potential improvements and offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events. 
Turning to North America on Slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining costs below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stope design, allowing us to ramp up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus, and you can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and will reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019. 
At Twin Creeks, we mined the first production stope at our new underground mine 1 month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a full year layback in the mega pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally planned to mine this layback through the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned. 
We signed a new 7-year, 12 million agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks Sage order claves and approved funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project. The project centers on sinking a production shaft that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit, and improve production rates and unit costs when it comes online in 2022. 
At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally, at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course, and we expect to complete the environmental impact statement process over 2018 and '19. 
Turning to South America on Slide 20. Our operations turned the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce. Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched full potential, with initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our near primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year. 
At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieved its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed in Quecher Main and we began stripping in the mine, and we continued to advance our Yanacocha Sulfide studies. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 21. The region continued to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we are beginning a layback of our existing Subika service mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional leach tanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stope at the Subika Underground mine, and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs rose as expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, we continue to advance our growth -- regional growth studies, which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, safely, on budget and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stope design, resulting in high grades, and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity. 
At KCGM, we continued to remediate a slip in the West wall of the Fimiston pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2018. We delayed approval timing so we can combine 2 permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule. We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter this year and to deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput 4x in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in the South pit. Mine plan optimization at Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. 
We've also approved a new project at Tanami to support continued expansion, turning to Slide 23. Our Tanami Power project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to site by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We've contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and 2 on-site power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. Our capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers the lease that will be paid over a 10-year period, and the project is expected to generate an internal rate of return greater than 50%.
Looking to the year ahead, on Slide 24. For 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit costs and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing full potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and plant maintenance shutdowns result in second half weighting, with our highest production and lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year and execute our planned maintenance, annual planned maintenance, at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
We then expect to ramp up production in the third quarter as we begin to process Silverstar ore and reach higher grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with Subika Underground coming online in both South American operations reaching higher grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we'll use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine.
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary"

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production, and about the same amount of our reserves, are located in the United States and Australia, and we continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near mine growth prospects, turning to Slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance to execution in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins, turning to Slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance. 
The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our current guidance, and the dark blue layer shows the 2 long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance.
Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
As does our leading reserve profile. Turning to Slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. The same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

But I think more importantly, and that's kind of where you're getting to, is on the far left, the greenfield side and where we are working with the team at continental in Columbia to progress that project and make a decision on whether we want to continue with that investment or not later this year or early next year. Our greenfield's efforts in French Guiana, efforts in the Yukon and in Australia. So a number of different projects. And I'll hand over to Tom to see if he's got a couple more to add into that mix."

You'll certainly see, in Merian, as we work through a stripping campaign in the first half to 3 quarters, will it reach some high-grade ores at Merian. So we'll see it quite weighted to the second half. Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, in around Ahafo as we're in the Subika layback at the open pit at Ahafo. We'll get into some high-grade ores at Subika. And then, we start to -- as we move into commercial production in Subika Underground and bring on the refrigeration plant and get more ventilation into the underground mine, we start to bring on some more ore and higher grades at our Subika Underground.

Our starting point for full potential is to offset escalation, but we certainly encourage all of our teams to drive to get upside about that and we certainly achieved that in spades in 2017. There is still plenty of upside in our Full Potential Program. It's moved from a site-by-site focus, and it's still very much the accountability of each site's team to deliver on their commitments around full potential. But we're seeing real potential upside around the opportunities to work together regionally and globally, and really leverage our global footprint as an organization. And we still see plenty of upside continuing in milling and mining to improve our costs and productivity. So we continue to drive that program hard, and I think there's still plenty of upside in the years ahead."

Before we get into",1303,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us thss morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. 
Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all cost, capital, and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on 4 continents, and demonstrating that leading financial, social and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand. 
Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on Slide 4. Highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution, which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining cost at $924 per ounce, with support from our full potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results; increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added a first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon; and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest [ work ] adds the greatest value. 
We also strengthened our global portfolio of long life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely, on time and on budget, advancing 5 projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets, replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana and across the Andes. 
Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile, and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. I'll expand on that topic on Slide 5. 
We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017. We also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks which, along with training, help keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards. As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 and the previous 5 years, with same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. 
It was an honor to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017, and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's Top 250 Best Managed Companies. Newmont was also ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in the areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. 
Our teams also differentiated by their project delivery record, turning to Slide 6. Over the last 3 years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region. 
In North America, we approved the twin underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground mine, which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led the government -- led to the government extending tax and royalty stability for another 5 years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. 
And most recently, in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power project to lower cost and emissions, and facilitate future growth. We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground, and Subika Underground this year. The 6 projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 7. Our 5-year guidance reflects cost and production improvements from our full potential work as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. Covering the highlights, our costs are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower-cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations. Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, and we expect to improve production and operating cost in the outer years through projects that have not yet been approved. 
We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and '19 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects, which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin, and we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha, where we added resources in 2017. 
We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritica project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. 
Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions, turning to Slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces, and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold price as the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources, exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. 
As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the IFC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions were primarily in North America and Australia, and our resource additions were spread more equally across our 4 regions. 
Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington, 800,000 ounces at Carlin underground and Cripple Creek & Victor, 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge, 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these exceptional results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prio",988,"Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. 
Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prior year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion and this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We adjusted -- we increased adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million, and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million. 
I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on Slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impact Newmont in just a moment. 
Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation and remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets, and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see the adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. 
We also delivered exceptional results for the full year, turning to Slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increase adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% at $22.7 billion.  Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion.
Turning to adjustments, to full year earnings per share on Slide 14. Here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investments; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. 
These results helped Newmont maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Turning to Slide 15. We've worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our 3 capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improved margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013, and in the fourth quarter, further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3x. Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend. Turning to Slide 16. In December, we announced plans to de-link our dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least 50%. Earlier this week, we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly 3x higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. 
$0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North American senior gold producer average of approximately 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns, while continuing to invest in profitable growth.
In addition to approving a dividend increase our Board of Directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year.
Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on Slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover 4 primary aspects here. First, we expect to reduce income tax rate to benefit our North America operations starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and costs. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont. In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. 
There are, however, 2 onetime noncash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Remeasurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses.
And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights, starting on Slide 18."

We delivered solid performance in 2017 by continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore body modeling; mine planning and execution; increasing mill throughput and recovery; and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us deliver more than $400 million in full potential improvements and offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events. 
Turning to North America on Slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining costs below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stope design, allowing us to ramp up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus, and you can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and will reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019. 
At Twin Creeks, we mined the first production stope at our new underground mine 1 month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a full year layback in the mega pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally planned to mine this layback through the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned. 
We signed a new 7-year, 12 million agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks Sage order claves and approved funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project. The project centers on sinking a production shaft that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit, and improve production rates and unit costs when it comes online in 2022. 
At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally, at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course, and we expect to complete the environmental impact statement process over 2018 and '19. 
Turning to South America on Slide 20. Our operations turned the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce. Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched full potential, with initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our near primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year. 
At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieved its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed in Quecher Main and we began stripping in the mine, and we continued to advance our Yanacocha Sulfide studies. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 21. The region continued to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we are beginning a layback of our existing Subika service mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional leach tanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stope at the Subika Underground mine, and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs rose as expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, we continue to advance our growth -- regional growth studies, which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, safely, on budget and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stope design, resulting in high grades, and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity. 
At KCGM, we continued to remediate a slip in the West wall of the Fimiston pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2018. We delayed approval timing so we can combine 2 permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule. We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter this year and to deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput 4x in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in the South pit. Mine plan optimization at Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. 
We've also approved a new project at Tanami to support continued expansion, turning to Slide 23. Our Tanami Power project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to site by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We've contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and 2 on-site power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. Our capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers the lease that will be paid over a 10-year period, and the project is expected to generate an internal rate of return greater than 50%.
Looking to the year ahead, on Slide 24. For 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit costs and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing full potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and plant maintenance shutdowns result in second half weighting, with our highest production and lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year and execute our planned maintenance, annual planned maintenance, at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
We then expect to ramp up production in the third quarter as we begin to process Silverstar ore and reach higher grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with Subika Underground coming online in both South American operations reaching higher grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we'll use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine.
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary"

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production, and about the same amount of our reserves, are located in the United States and Australia, and we continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near mine growth prospects, turning to Slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance to execution in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins, turning to Slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance. 
The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our current guidance, and the dark blue layer shows the 2 long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance.
Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
As does our leading reserve profile. Turning to Slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. The same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

You'll certainly see, in Merian, as we work through a stripping campaign in the first half to 3 quarters, will it reach some high-grade ores at Merian. So we'll see it quite weighted to the second half. Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, in around Ahafo as we're in the Subika layback at the open pit at Ahafo. We'll get into some high-grade ores at Subika. And then, we start to -- as we move into commercial production in Subika Underground and bring on the refrigeration plant and get more ventilation into the underground mine, we start to bring on some more ore and higher grades at our Subika Underground.

So as we start the process the harder ore, it will come down to those sorts of rates. It will be -- we've been running up around 15. I think it will be a combination of fresh rock and still some saprolite. So the 12 million to 14 million tonnes per annum is probably something worth modeling."

Our starting point for full potential is to offset escalation, but we certainly encourage all of our teams to drive to get upside about that and we certainly achieved that in spades in 2017. There is still plenty of upside in our Full Potential Program. It's moved from a site-by-site focus, and it's still very much the accountability of each site's team to deliver on their commitments around full potential. But we're seeing real potential upside around the opportunities to work together regionally and globally, and really leverage our global footprint as an organization. And we still see plenty of upside continuing in milling and mining to improve our costs and productivity. So we continue to drive that program hard, and I think there's still plenty of upside in the years ahead."

I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. Before we get into",1303,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer term value creation. 
Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all cost, capital, and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on 4 continents, and demonstrating that leading financial, social and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand. 
Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on Slide 4. Highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution, which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining cost at $924 per ounce, with support from our full potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results; increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added a first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon; and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest [ work ] adds the greatest value. 
We also strengthened our global portfolio of long life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely, on time and on budget, advancing 5 projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets, replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana and across the Andes. 
Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile, and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. I'll expand on that topic on Slide 5. 
We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017. We also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks which, along with training, help keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards. As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 and the previous 5 years, with same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. 
It was an honor to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017, and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's Top 250 Best Managed Companies. Newmont was also ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in the areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. 
Our teams also differentiated by their project delivery record, turning to Slide 6. Over the last 3 years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region. 
In North America, we approved the twin underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground mine, which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led the government -- led to the government extending tax and royalty stability for another 5 years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. 
And most recently, in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power project to lower cost and emissions, and facilitate future growth. We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground, and Subika Underground this year. The 6 projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 7. Our 5-year guidance reflects cost and production improvements from our full potential work as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. Covering the highlights, our costs are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower-cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations. Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, and we expect to improve production and operating cost in the outer years through projects that have not yet been approved. 
We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and '19 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects, which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin, and we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha, where we added resources in 2017. 
We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritica project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. 
Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions, turning to Slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces, and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold price as the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources, exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. 
As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the IFC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions were primarily in North America and Australia, and our resource additions were spread more equally across our 4 regions. 
Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington, 800,000 ounces at Carlin underground and Cripple Creek & Victor, 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge, 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these exceptional results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."
291795,549169699,1400839,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prio",988,"Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year, and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend and balance sheet. 
Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Compared to the prior year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion and this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We adjusted -- we increased adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million, and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million. 
I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on Slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impact Newmont in just a moment. 
Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation and remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets, and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see the adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. 
We also delivered exceptional results for the full year, turning to Slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increase adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% at $22.7 billion. Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion.
Turning to adjustments, to full year earnings per share on Slide 14. Here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investments; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. 
These results helped Newmont maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Turning to Slide 15. We've worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our 3 capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improved margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013, and in the fourth quarter, further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3x. Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend. Turning to Slide 16. In December, we announced plans to de-link our dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least 50%. Earlier this week, we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly 3x higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. 
$0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North American senior gold producer average of approximately 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns, while continuing to invest in profitable growth.
In addition to approving a dividend increase our Board of Directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year.
Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on Slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover 4 primary aspects here. First, we expect to reduce income tax rate to benefit our North America operations starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and costs. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont. In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. 
There are, however, 2 onetime noncash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Remeasurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses.
And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights, starting on Slide 18."

We delivered solid performance in 2017 by continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore body modeling; mine planning and execution; increasing mill throughput and recovery; and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us deliver more than $400 million in full potential improvements and offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events. 
Turning to North America on Slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining costs below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stope design, allowing us to ramp up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus, and you can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and will reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019. 
At Twin Creeks, we mined the first production stope at our new underground mine 1 month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a full year layback in the mega pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally planned to mine this layback through the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned. 
We signed a new 7-year, 12 million agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks Sage order claves and approved funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge mine optimization project. The project centers on sinking a production shaft that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit, and improve production rates and unit costs when it comes online in 2022. 
At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally, at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course, and we expect to complete the environmental impact statement process over 2018 and '19. 
Turning to South America on Slide 20. Our operations turned the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce. Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched full potential, with initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our near primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year. 
At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieved its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed in Quecher Main and we began stripping in the mine, and we continued to advance our Yanacocha Sulfide studies. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 21. The region continued to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we are beginning a layback of our existing Subika service mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional leach tanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stope at the Subika Underground mine, and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs rose as expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, we continue to advance our growth -- regional growth studies, which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, safely, on budget and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stope design, resulting in high grades, and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity. 
At KCGM, we continued to remediate a slip in the West wall of the Fimiston pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2018. We delayed approval timing so we can combine 2 permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule. We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter this year and to deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput 4x in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in the South pit. Mine plan optimization at Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. 
We've also approved a new project at Tanami to support continued expansion, turning to Slide 23. Our Tanami Power project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to site by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We've contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and 2 on-site power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. Our capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers the lease that will be paid over a 10-year period, and the project is expected to generate an internal rate of return greater than 50%.
Looking to the year ahead, on Slide 24. For 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit costs and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing full potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and plant maintenance shutdowns result in second half weighting, with our highest production and lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year and execute our planned maintenance, annual planned maintenance, at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
We then expect to ramp up production in the third quarter as we begin to process Silverstar ore and reach higher grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with Subika Underground coming online in both South American operations reaching higher grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we'll use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine.
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary"

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production, and about the same amount of our reserves, are located in the United States and Australia, and we continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near mine growth prospects, turning to Slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance to execution in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins, turning to Slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance. 
The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our current guidance, and the dark blue layer shows the 2 long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance.
Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
As does our leading reserve profile. Turning to Slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. The same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

You'll certainly see, in Merian, as we work through a stripping campaign in the first half to 3 quarters, will it reach some high-grade ores at Merian. So we'll see it quite weighted to the second half. Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, in around Ahafo as we're in the Subika layback at the open pit at Ahafo. We'll get into some high-grade ores at Subika. And then, we start to -- as we move into commercial production in Subika Underground and bring on the refrigeration plant and get more ventilation into the underground mine, we start to bring on some more ore and higher grades at our Subika Underground.

Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018, our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we are building 7 profitable projects in 4 continents, and we advance the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA, and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo mill expansion that resulted in 6 fatalities. 
Turning to Slide 4. As background construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7, when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful in 6 men whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our leadership team in reaching out to their families. Our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences. We've assembled an expect investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened. 
Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident, so we could review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and the team are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill expansion has been suspended, until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important. Turning to more details on the quarter on Slide 5. We continue to deliver our strategy starting with superior operational execution, this includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce in line with guidance. And continuing to improve costs and productivity through our Full Potential Program. For instance, we are launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter, we remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced the Ahafo North, Yanacocha sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study, and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our new mine exploration programs, as always promising Greenfield's prospects on 4 continents. We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter. Declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly 3x higher than the first quarter of 2017, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. 
Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and the lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our sustainability report beyond the mine, which is posted on our website. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our cost rise temporarily in 2018 as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington stripping, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment and expiration in projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Cost will come back down as we reach higher grades and bring up a new lower-cost production at Subika Underground later this year. 
Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance, and we continue to improve costs and efficiency by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains and mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018. And we are on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter. As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year, when we recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa, and bring the Subika Underground project online. 
Turning to more on our current projects on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial product at the Subika Underground this year. And we begun the restart construction work at Ahafo Mill expansion as we performed detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved. In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor for processing in our Nevada Mills in early 2018, and Tom will have more on the results today. And South America, is well underway, this product is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's sulfide deposits. Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20% helping to improve our outlook. 
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We have not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks. Turning to our longer-term growth prospects on Slide 10, our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage and 1 that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and product experience, and strong regional relationships. 
In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study, and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin, we are working with gold strike to further explore the plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha sulfides project, and have included a new project Chaquicocha Oxides that Tom will review in more detail. We are partnering with Continental gold to support the safe and efficient development in the high-grade project, as well as nearby exploration assets in Columbia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early stage exploration property in French Guiana. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and and we are working with the local partner to explore Greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in our Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing Greenfield's exploration prospects invest in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million. Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects. 
Turning to Slide 13, to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs, and a $0.02 loss, primarily due to evaluation losses under deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 14. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion, and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter. Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend, plus the share buyback program, executed in the first quarter of this year, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy. And now I hand it over to Tom for discussion of our operations, starting on Slide 15."

Turning to Africa on Slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people. Starting with our lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill expansion, and extending to our team, who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We are working to understand what went wrong so that we can make sure it never happens again. Not only at Newmont, but in the broader mining community. Turning to operational performance. At Ahafo chain delivered strong results in first quarter. This is largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana nonworkers union. 
The Subika Underground continues on course, we are currently developing a 7 stope, and expect to reach commercial production later this year. Driving outlook for an even stronger second half. Let me approved funding for definitive feasibility study at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing a project, securing permits, and engaging stakeholders. 
Finally, we continue to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and. Turning to North America on Slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and start design has allowed us to ramp up production with improve development rates and higher grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar and expect to reach over later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We are processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor and seeing higher than expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6. waste production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full year cost to improve with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher-than-expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada. 
At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold in 2018, and we shipped a higher grade copper zones beginning in 2020. 
Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher cost for 2018. This is a result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage the technical issues, and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts, and our North America production outlook remains unchanged. 
Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks underground and Northwest Exodus later this year. And Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way for potential production by 2024. We also recently executed a purchase agreement for the Agnico Eagle, with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in the land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly perspective district. Turning to South America on Slide 18. Merian Continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity. And we mining in other Maraba pit providing higher grade ore to the mill. A primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock. Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration of Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we did not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized ore strategies at the mill. Stripping has begun at mine, and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha, where we are dividing 2 underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit. You can see those shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage. And we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter. And we continue our work to optimize our technical approach. 
Turning to Australia, on Slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from 4 to 3. This change delayed some production in the first quarter. But we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach higher gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets. We're also resequencing our mine plan at KCGM, as we take a considered approach to remediating the West wall flip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we reduced our production outlook for 2018 of 40,000 ounces. Despite the short-term setback, we are well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our Full Potential Program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance. And we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion. We have started rise both drilling to guide our approach to ship thinking a shaft that allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a decision on the project in the second half of 2019. And for the construction to take around 2 years. And finally, we began construction on the Tanami Power project, which involves building a pipeline and 2 power stations that will allow us to diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019, and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%. Looking to the remainder of 2018, on Slide 20. Our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged. Despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back half weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower-cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve the highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we are on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, cost and productivity and our operations and projects. With that, I'll hand it back over to Gary, on Slide 21."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near mine growth prospects. Turning to Slide 23. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill expansion in Ghana, and in Peru. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo north, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, you shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 24. Here is a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations, as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo north project, which is not included in our guidance, in the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects. Tanami expansion to, Yanacocha sulfides, which represents further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. As those are leading reserve profile. Turning you to Slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per thousand shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years. And more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves as help sustain top quartile total shareholder return, since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. 
Summing it all up on Slide 6. Our performance in the first quarter was strong, but indelibly marked with a 6 fatalities, our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and we commit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production, safely and at competitive costs, over a longer term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio, and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we are pulled.

Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building 7 profitable projects on 4 continents, and we advanced the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in 6 fatalities.
Turning to Slide 4. As a background, construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7, when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful, and 6 men, whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our regional leadership team in reaching out to their families, our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences. We've assembled an expect investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened.
Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident, so we could review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and Akyem are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill Expansion has been suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important. 
Turning to more details on the quarter, on Slide 5. We continued to deliver our strategy, starting with superior operational execution. This includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce, in line with guidance, and continuing to improve costs and productivity through our Full Potential Program. For instance, we're launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance. We also continued to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks Underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study, and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our new mine exploration programs as well as promising Greenfields prospects on 4 continents.
We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter, declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly 3x higher than the first quarter of 2017 and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our sustainability report, Beyond the Mine, which is posted on our website.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our costs raised temporarily in 2018 as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment and exploration in projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Costs will come back down as we reach higher grades and bring out new lower-cost production at Subika Underground later this year.
Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance, and we continue to improve costs and efficiency by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability.
Turning to production, on Slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains and mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018. And we're on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter. As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year, when we'll recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa and bring the Subika Underground project online.
Turning to more on our current projects, on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial product at the Subika Underground later this year. And we begun to restart construction work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion as we performed detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved. In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor for processing in our Nevada Mills in early 2018, and Tom will have more on our results to date. In South America, Quecher Main is well underway. This project is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We've not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks.
Turning to our longer-term growth prospects, on Slide 10. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage and one that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and project experience and strong regional relationships.
In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin. We're working with Goldstrike to further explore the plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha Sulfides project and have included a new project, Chaquicocha Oxides, that Tom will review in more detail. We're partnering with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early-stage exploration property in French Guiana. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore Greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing Greenfields exploration prospects in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million. Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects.
Turning to Slide 13, to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs and a $0.02 loss, primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities, on Slide 14. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter. Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend plus the share buyback program executed in the first quarter of this year, we're on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy.
And now, I hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations, starting on Slide 15."
291795,556683773,1438511,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nancy.

Turning to Africa, on Slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people, starting with those who lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion and extending to our team who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We're working to understand what went wrong, so that we can make sure it never happens again, not only at Newmont but in the broader mining community.
   
Turning to operational performance. Both Ahafo and Akyem delivered strong results in the first quarter. This was largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower-grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana Mineworkers Union.
The Subika Underground continues on course. We are currently developing our seventh stope and expect to reach commercial production later this year, driving outlook for an even stronger second half. And we approved funding for definitive feasibility studies at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing the project, securing permits and engaging stakeholders. Finally, we continued to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem. 
Turning to North America, on Slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and stope design has allowed us to ramp up production with improved development rates and high grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar pit and expect to reach ore later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We're processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor and seeing higher-than-expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6. CC&V's production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full year cost to improve with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher-than-expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada.
At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold zones in 2018 and will shift to higher-grade copper zones beginning in 2020.
Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher costs for 2018. This is a result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage geotechnical issues and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts, and our North America production outlook remains unchanged.
Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus later this year. And Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way for potential production by 2024. We also recently executed a purchase agreement for the Agnico Eagle -- with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly prospective district. 
Turning to South America, on Slide 18. Merian Continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity. And we commenced mining in the Maraba pit, providing high-grade saprolite ore to the mill. A primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock. Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration of Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we do not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized ore blending strategies at the gold mill. Stripping has begun at Quecher Main, and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha, where we are dividing 2 underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit. You can see these shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage. And we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha Sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter. And we continue our work to optimize our technical approach.
Turning to Australia, on Slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from 4 to 3. This change delayed some production in the first quarter, but we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach higher gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets. We're also resequencing our mine plan at KCGM, as we take a considered approach to remediating the west wall slip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we've reduced our production outlook for 2018 by 40,000 ounces. Despite this short-term setback, we're well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our Full Potential Program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance. And we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion. We've started raise bore drilling at pilot hole to guide our approach to sinking a shaft that will allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a funding decision on the project in the second half of 2019 and for construction to take around 2 years. And finally, we've began construction on the Tanami Power project, which involves building a pipeline and 2 power stations that will allow us to switch from diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019, and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%.
Looking to the remainder of 2018, on Slide 20. Our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged, despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back-half-weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower-cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve our highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we are on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, costs and productivity at our operations and projects. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary, on Slide 21."
291795,556683773,1438511,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time.

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near-mine growth prospects.
Turning to Slide 23. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019.  Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance, and the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage, as does our leading reserve profile.
Turning you to Slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years. And more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped sustain top quartile total shareholder return since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer-time horizon.
Summing it all up on Slide 26. Our performance in the first quarter was strong, but indelibly marked by the 6 fatalities our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and recommit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer-term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

So now as we identified and defined that oxide deposit, those exploration drifts will enable us to further define those. And then we'll have, as through the exploration drift, a fair bit of that mine infrastructure ready, if we can prove them up, to develop the stopes and mine that ore. So the exploration drifts provide some of that infrastructure, the oxides then provide a further bridge from Quecher Main to the sulfides. That ore is mill grade, so it can process through our current mill at Yanacocha. And the work we do to bring it on will actually provide synergies in terms of infrastructure for underground sulfides at Chaquicocha."

Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building 7 profitable projects on 4 continents, and we",1179,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building 7 profitable projects on 4 continents, and we advanced the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in 6 fatalities.
Turning to Slide 4. As a background, construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7, when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful, and 6 men, whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our regional leadership team in reaching out to their families, our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences. We've assembled an expert investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened.
Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident, so we can review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and Akyem are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill Expansion has been suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important. 
Turning to more details on the quarter on Slide 5. We continued to deliver our strategy, starting with superior operational execution. This includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce, in line with guidance, and continuing to improve costs and productivity through our Full Potential Program. For instance, we're launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance. We also continued to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks Underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study, and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our near mine exploration programs as well as promising Greenfields prospects on 4 continents.
We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter, declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly 3x higher than the first quarter of 2017 and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our sustainability report, Beyond the Mine, which is posted on our website.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our costs raised temporarily in 2018 as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment and exploration in projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Costs will come back down as we reach higher grades and bring out new lower-cost production at Subika Underground later this year.
Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance, and we continue to improve costs and efficiency by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability.
Turning to production, on Slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains and mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018. And we're on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter. As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year, when we'll recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa and bring the Subika Underground project online.
Turning to more on our current projects, on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial product at the Subika Underground later this year. And we begun to restart construction work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion as we performed detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved. In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor for processing in our Nevada Mills in early 2018, and Tom will have more on our results to date. In South America, Quecher Main is well underway. This project is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We've not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks.
Turning to our longer-term growth prospects, on Slide 10. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage and one that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and project experience and strong regional relationships.
In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin. We're working with Goldstrike to further explore the plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha Sulfides project and have included a new project, Chaquicocha Oxides, that Tom will review in more detail. We're partnering with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early-stage exploration property in French Guiana. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore Greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing Greenfields exploration prospects in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million. Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects.
Turning to Slide 13, to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs and a $0.02 loss, primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities, on Slide 14. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter. Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend plus the share buyback program executed in the first quarter of this year, we're on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy.
And now, I hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations, starting on Slide 15."

Turning to Africa, on Slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people, starting with those who lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion and extending to our team who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We're working to understand what went wrong, so that we can make sure it never happens again, not only at Newmont but in the broader mining community.
   
Turning to operational performance. Both Ahafo and Akyem delivered strong results in the first quarter. This was largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower-grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana Mineworkers Union.
The Subika Underground continues on course. We are currently developing our seventh stope and expect to reach commercial production later this year, driving outlook for an even stronger second half. And we approved funding for definitive feasibility studies at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing the project, securing permits and engaging stakeholders. Finally, we continued to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem. 
Turning to North America, on Slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and stope design has allowed us to ramp up production with improved development rates and high grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar pit and expect to reach ore later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We're processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor and seeing higher-than-expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6. CC&V's production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full year cost to improve with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher-than-expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada.
At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold zones in 2018 and will shift to higher-grade copper zones beginning in 2020.
Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher costs for 2018. This is a result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage geotechnical issues and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts, and our North America production outlook remains unchanged.
Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus later this year. And Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way to potential production by 2024. We also recently executed a purchase agreement for the Agnico Eagle -- with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly prospective district. 
Turning to South America, on Slide 18. Merian continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity. And we commenced mining in the Maraba pit, providing high-grade saprolite ore to the mill. A primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock. Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration of Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we do not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized ore blending strategies at the gold mill. Stripping has begun at Quecher Main, and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha, where we are dividing 2 underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit. You can see these shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage. And we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha Sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter. And we continue our work to optimize our technical approach.
Turning to Australia, on Slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from 4 to 3. This change delayed some production in the first quarter, but we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach higher gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets. We're also resequencing our mine plan at KCGM, as we take a considered approach to remediating the west wall slip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we've reduced our production outlook for 2018 by 40,000 ounces. Despite this short-term setback, we're well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our Full Potential Program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance. And we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion. We've started raise bore drilling at pilot hole to guide our approach to sinking a shaft that will allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a funding decision on the project in the second half of 2019 and for construction to take around 2 years. And finally, we've began construction on the Tanami Power project, which involves building a pipeline and 2 power stations that will allow us to switch from diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019, and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%.
Looking to the remainder of 2018, on Slide 20. Our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged, despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back-half-weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower-cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve our highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we are on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, costs and productivity at our operations and projects. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary, on Slide 21."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near-mine growth prospects.
Turning to Slide 23. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019.  Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance, and the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage, as does our leading reserve profile.
Turning you to Slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years. And more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped sustain top quartile total shareholder return since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer-time horizon.
Summing it all up on Slide 26. Our performance in the first quarter was strong, but indelibly marked by the 6 fatalities our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and recommit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer-term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

And then we'll have, as through the exploration drift, a fair bit of that mine infrastructure ready, if we can prove them up, to develop the stopes and mine that ore. So the exploration drifts provide some of that infrastructure, the oxides then provide a further bridge from Quecher Main to the sulfides. That ore is mill grade, so it can process through our current mill at Yanacocha.

In terms of the mill expansion itself, the status of it, it's -- we're about -- this accident happened around the civil construction, and we're about 70% through that work for the project and very much moving into the structural, mechanical, piping phase of the project. So that's the status of the project. We're reasonably well advanced. And if you recall commercial production is in the second half of next year. So we're going through a process as we look to ramp up of inductions, refreshers and doing robust risk assessments on all the work fronts we have across that project as we bring it up to speed.

Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building 7 profitable projects on 4 continents, and we advanced the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in 6 fatalities.
Turning to Slide 4. As a background, construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7, when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful, and 6 men, whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our regional leadership team in reaching out to their families, our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences. We've assembled an expert investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened.
Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident, so we can review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and Akyem are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill Expansion has been suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important. 
Turning to more details on the quarter on Slide 5. We continued to deliver our strategy, starting with superior operational execution. This includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce, in line with guidance, and continuing to improve costs and productivity through our Full Potential Program. For instance, we're launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance. We also continued to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks Underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study, and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our near mine exploration programs as well as promising Greenfields prospects on 4 continents.
We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter, declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly 3x higher than the first quarter of 2017 and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our sustainability report, Beyond the Mine, which is posted on our website.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our costs raised temporarily in 2018 as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment and exploration in projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Costs will come back down as we reach higher grades and bring out new lower-cost production at Subika Underground later this year.
Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance, and we continue to improve costs and efficiency by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability.
Turning to production, on Slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains and mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018. And we're on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter. As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year, when we'll recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa and bring the Subika Underground project online.
Turning to more on our current projects, on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial product at the Subika Underground later this year. And we began to restart construction work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion as we performed detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved. In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor for processing in our Nevada Mills in early 2018, and Tom will have more on our results to date. In South America, Quecher Main is well underway. This project is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We've not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks.
Turning to our longer-term growth prospects, on Slide 10. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage and one that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and project experience and strong regional relationships.
In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin. We're working with Goldstrike to further explore the plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha Sulfides project and have included a new project, Chaquicocha Oxides, that Tom will review in more detail. We're partnering with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early-stage exploration property in French Guiana. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore Greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing Greenfields exploration prospects in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance."

Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million. Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects.
Turning to Slide 13, to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs and a $0.02 loss, primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities, on Slide 14. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter. Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend plus the share buyback program executed in the first quarter of this year, we're on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy.
And now, I hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations, starting on Slide 15."

Turning to Africa, on Slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people, starting with those who lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion and extending to our team who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We're working to understand what went wrong, so that we can make sure it never happens again, not only at Newmont but in the broader mining community.
   
Turning to operational performance. Both Ahafo and Akyem delivered strong results in the first quarter. This was largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower-grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana Mineworkers Union.
The Subika Underground continues on course. We are currently developing our seventh stope and expect to reach commercial production later this year, driving outlook for an even stronger second half. And we approved funding for definitive feasibility studies at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing the project, securing permits and engaging stakeholders. Finally, we continued to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem. 
Turning to North America, on Slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and stope design has allowed us to ramp up production with improved development rates and high grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar pit and expect to reach ore later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We're processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek and Victor and seeing higher-than-expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6. CC&V's production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full year cost to improve with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher-than-expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada.
At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold zones in 2018 and will shift to higher-grade copper zones beginning in 2020.
Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher costs for 2018. This is a result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage geotechnical issues and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts, and our North America production outlook remains unchanged.
Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus later this year. And Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way to potential production by 2024. We also recently executed a purchase agreement for the Agnico Eagle -- with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly prospective district. 
Turning to South America, on Slide 18. Merian continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity. And we commenced mining in the Maraba pit, providing high-grade saprolite ore to the mill. A primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock. Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration of Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we do not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized ore blending strategies at the gold mill. Stripping has begun at Quecher Main, and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha, where we are dividing 2 underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit. You can see these shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage. And we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha Sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter. And we continue our work to optimize our technical approach.
Turning to Australia, on Slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from 4 to 3. This change delayed some production in the first quarter, but we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach higher gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets. We're also resequencing our mine plan at KCGM, as we take a considered approach to remediating the west wall slip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we've reduced our production outlook for 2018 by 40,000 ounces. Despite this short-term setback, we're well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our Full Potential Program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance. And we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion. We've started raise bore drilling at pilot hole to guide our approach to sinking a shaft that will allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a funding decision on the project in the second half of 2019 and for construction to take around 2 years. And finally, we've began construction on the Tanami Power project, which involves building a pipeline and 2 power stations that will allow us to switch from diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019, and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%.
Looking to the remainder of 2018, on Slide 20. Our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged, despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back-half-weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower-cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve our highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we are on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, costs and productivity at our operations and projects. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Gary, on Slide 21."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions, where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near-mine growth prospects.
Turning to Slide 23. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production, while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019.  Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. Here's a look at our production profile over the next 7 years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance, and the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage, as does our leading reserve profile.
Turning you to Slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per 1,000 shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years. And more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped sustain top quartile total shareholder return since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer-time horizon.
Summing it all up on Slide 26. Our performance in the first quarter was strong, but indelibly marked by the 6 fatalities our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and recommit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer-term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions."

So now as we identified and defined that oxide deposit, those exploration drifts will enable us to further define those. And then we'll have, as through the exploration drift, a fair bit of that mine infrastructure ready, if we can prove them up, to develop the stopes and mine that ore. So the exploration drifts provide some of that infrastructure, the oxides then provide a further bridge from Quecher Main to the sulfides. That ore is mill grade, so it can process through our current mill at Yanacocha. And the work we do to bring it on will actually provide synergies in terms of infrastructure for underground sulfides at Chaquicocha."

We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This is the resu",1352,"Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This is the result of a study focus on meeting our commitments: to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient; to deliver 2 projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio; and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance. 
Turning to more details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, keeping as in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance. And we continued to improve costs and efficiency. I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week, where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian fleet. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allows the team at Merian to investigate and correct the problem that could have caused serious engine damage. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower cost reduction in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance prefeasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio. And we have about 85 drilling rigs operating around the world to advance brownfield and greenfield prospects. 
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment-grade credit rating in nearly $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. While our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be, and we've launched 2 initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery. 
Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures and performing comprehensive risk assessments when tasks or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, but as expected, our cost rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program, focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold in an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and expansions into production. And 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. We recently delivered 2 profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks underground on the 1st of July, which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for [ $42 million ] just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This expansion adds higher grade, lower-cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that have previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030. 
Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This expansion adds lower-cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with 2 autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills. And we've set up underground WiFi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected. 
In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is ramping, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20%, helping to improve our outlook. 
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth.  However, we're beginning to see early signs that input cost, including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates, could put pressure in our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks. 
Turning to our latest investment in the future on Slide 10. This morning, we announced agreement to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek in the form of partnership with Teck, who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in 3 stages: on completion of the prefeasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project. We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strengths and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for prefeasibility studies over the next several months and manage the projects into a joint steering committee. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 12 for the highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter driven by lower sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher realized gold price; adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share; and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017. 
Cash from continuing operations was [ $401 million ] compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments. 
Turning to Slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primarily adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, and we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities, including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track and return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018. 
And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15."

Turning to North America on Slide [ 16. ] As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we [ slightly ] completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget. And we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to de-weight the fleet in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore. 
At CC&V, production was impacted by lower electric recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped a 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months. In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. This will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018. 
Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins at the next layback of the mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower-cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend profitable production in North America. And finally, studies into the next phase of Long Canyon are continuing on course. 
Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year. Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward. And our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian, and they are starting to deliver further improvements. 
At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has help offset lower electric recoveries. And we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower-cost oxides over deep transitional ore. We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing, and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha sulfides to reach definitive feasibility later this year. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston pit in mid-May. The mine's detection system identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit, however, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rates have been reduced, and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between [ 290,000 ] and 330,000 ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall event and are engaged for the effective underwriters. 
Announced [indiscernible] Underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally and the site is able to process stockpile ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer-term impacts, including mine plan reevaluations. 
We have received the APA permit for the Morrison layback, and subject to the mine plan reviews, still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year. 
At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with higher production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018 and it will continue through 2019. 
At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil works for the power stations is well underway and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit costs increased due to higher inventory costs driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between [ $880 ] and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance. Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and in the process of safety restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo Mill Expansion schedule will shift first goal into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the total capital estimate. 
Subika Underground continues to ramp up. And despite minor delays in construction service infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo underground, and we progressed Akyem underground project prefeasibility. This next stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence. 
Turning to the rest of the year on Slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering our highest production and lowest cost in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, our global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018. 
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 21."
291795,571333670,1509163,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount",735,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that we will improve -- that will improve our margins, reserves and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 23. Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. The Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook but were removed from the pipeline at completion. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This quarter, we advanced Akyem underground from sculping to prefeasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 -- developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore processed through the existing mill. 
Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a prefeasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 24. This is our expected production profile for the next 7 years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, just not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represented distinct competitive advantage. And we maintained that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration. 
Turning to Slide 25. In North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the prefeasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon, and we plan to test 8 different drill targets in this year.  Finally, we will begin sculping prefeasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over 3 to 4 years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake. 
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfidesand Chaquicocha Oxides project in Peru. And we're working with Continental gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritica project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medellin and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish presence and relationships in the country. 
In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia.  
Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair laned agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement. 
Putting it all together on Slide 26. We delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long time horizon, invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

Long Canyon, we continue the development of Phase 2, some interesting things around immigrants that we're taking a look at. So as we use both current technology and continue to extend the use of our Deep Sensing Geochemistry to better understand things that may be covered at depths that we haven't actually looked at, most of what's been discovered today has had some sort of a surface exposure or accidentally found by a water well or something.

A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we're doing at that east wall, how we might layback that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we need to do to better inform that approach. So that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and understand the longer-term impacts beyond [ 2018 ] and then how we access the greater Morrison resource. But we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit,  and there's some material on the Western Wall as well that we will be stacking that's sitting underneath the West wall slip.

Thanks, Tanya, for the question. We're working through a process where some local residents raised some concerns over payment of ground and crop compensation that takes back to before the mine started and then having some issues around mine-related impacts. So everything we're doing is consistent with what we're acquired to do in terms of the agreements we had in place. But we've been involved, in good faith, dialogue with community leaders, with the people who are raising those concerns and working through a mediation process to reach a form of resolution there with them. So that process has been progressing over a period of time. What you saw in more recent times is that the group, which we're quite comfortable with, have staged demonstration to further support their claim.

291795,571333670,1510278,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a resul",1348,"Thank you, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a result of a study focused on meeting our commitments, to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient, to deliver 2 projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio, and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance.
Turning to more details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, keeping us in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance. And we continued to improve costs and efficiency. I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week, where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian's fleet. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allowed the team at Merian to investigate and correct the problem that could have caused serious engine damage.
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower cost production in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world-class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance prefeasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio. And we have about 85 drill rigs operating around the world to advance brownfields and greenfields prospects.
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investor-grade credit rating and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.
Turning to Slide 5. While our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be and we've launched 2 initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery.
Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures and performing comprehensive risk assessments when task or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, but as expected, our cost rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program, focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability.
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and expansions into production. And 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas.
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. We recently delivered 2 profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground on the 1st of July, which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for $42 million, just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This expansion adds higher-grade, lower-cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030.
Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This expansion adds lower-cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with 2 autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills. And we've set up underground WiFi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected.
In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is wrapping up and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth.  However, we're beginning to see early signs that input cost, including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates, could put pressure on our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks.
Turning to our latest investment and the future on Slide 10. This morning, we announced agreements to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek in the form of partnership with Teck, who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in 3 stages: on completion of the prefeasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project. We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio, and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strength and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for prefeasibility studies over the next several months and manage the projects through a joint steering committee.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 12 for the highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter driven by lower sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher realized gold price, adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017.
Cash from continuing operations was $401 million compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments.
Turning to Slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector and we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities, including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018.
And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15."

As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we safely completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget. And we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to deweight the slip in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore.
At CC&V, production was impacted by lower leach recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months. In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. This will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018.
Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins in the next layback of the Mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower-cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend profitable production in North America. And finally, studies into the next phase for Long Canyon are continuing on course.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year. Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward. And our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian and we are starting to deliver further improvements.
At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has helped offset slow leach recoveries. And we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower-cost oxides over deep transitional ore. We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing, and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha Sulfides to reach definitive feasibility late this year.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston Pit in mid-May. The mine's detection systems identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit, however, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rates have been reduced and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between 280,000 and 330,000 ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall events and are engaged with the effective underwriters.
[indiscernible] Underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally and the site is able to process stockpiled ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer-term impacts, including mine plan reevaluations.
We have received the APA permit for the Morrison layback, and subject to the mine plan reviews still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year.
At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with higher production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018 and it will continue through 2019.
At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil works for the power stations is well underway and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach.
Turning to Africa on the Slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit cost increased due to high inventory costs driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between $880 and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance. Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and are in the process of safely restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo Mill Expansion schedule will shift first gold into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the total capital estimate.
Subika Underground continues to ramp up. And despite minor delays in construction surface infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo Underground, and we progressed the Akyem Underground project prefeasibility. This next stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence.
Turning to the rest of the year on Slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering our highest production and lowest cost in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018.
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 21."
291795,571333670,1510278,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success.

We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that we will improve -- that will improve our margins, reserves and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline.
Turning to Slide 23. Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook but were removed from the pipeline at completion. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This quarter, we advanced Akyem Underground from scoping to prefeasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 -- developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore processed through the existing mill.
Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a prefeasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. This is our expected production profile for the next 7 years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage, and will maintain that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration.
Turning to Slide 25. In North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the prefeasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon, and we plan to test 8 different drill targets this year. Finally, we will begin scoping prefeasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over 3 to 4 years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake.
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And we're working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medellin and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish her presence and relationships in the country.
In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia.
Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair-lined agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement.
Putting it all together on Slide 26. We delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long time horizon, invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time.

Long Canyon, we continue the development of Phase 2, some interesting things around immigrants that we're taking a look at. So as we use both current technology and continue to extend the use of our Deep Sensing Geochemistry to better understand things that may be covered at depths that we haven't actually looked at, most of what's been discovered today has had some sort of a surface exposure or been accidentally found by a water well or something.

So with the slip on the east wall, that took out the ramp on the east wall of that pit. So that was the ramp we're planning to use for the Morrison layback that we were bringing forward. So as we work through the reassessment of Morrison, it will be how we can mine a smaller Morrison and not rely upon that ramp on the east wall. As we work through our longer-term plans, looking it up -- and a lot of the work today was about safely understanding the impact of that slip and understanding the impact for this year. So work is still underway in terms of the longer-term impact and the various scenarios around that. A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we're doing at that east wall, how we might layback that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we need to do to better inform that approach. So that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and then understand the longer-term impacts beyond 2018 and then how we access the greater Morrison resource. But we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit and there's some material on the western wall as well that we will be stacking that's been sitting underneath the west wall slip. And we'll continue to process stockpiled ore through the mill. So the processing plant -- well, the 3 processing plants at KCGM are still running at full rates. And in fact, they are running at rates that we haven't seen since 2005. So we're maximizing the processing through the plant to minimize the impact from the slip."

We'll stockpile them because we had to do some improvements to a county road that is now complete. So we're ramping up shipments as we speak. And we're now commissioning a cleaner concentrate circuit that would reduce higher grade, particularly in sulfur coming out of the CC&V plant. So that gold and sulfur will go into Mill 6. So it provides a heat source that allows us to put higher grade Carlin ore through Mill 6. So we will see some benefit at Carlin as a result of that fuel source that comes from that concentrate. We're still very much on target to hit our guidance for CC&V. So if you just look at the first half and extrapolate where we're predicting guidance to be for the year, you get a measure of the impact of shipping that concentrate to Nevada is going to have on CC&V gold production for the full year and in particular, the second half."

We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a resul",1348,"Thank you, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a result of a study focused on meeting our commitments; to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient; to deliver 2 projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget; and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio; and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance.
Turning to more details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, keeping us in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance. And we continued to improve costs and efficiency. I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week, where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian's fleet. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allowed the team at Merian to investigate and correct the problem that could have caused serious engine damage.
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower cost production in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world-class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance pre-feasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio. And we had about 85 drill rigs operating around the world to advance brownfields and greenfields prospects.
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investor-grade credit rating and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.
Turn to Slide 5. While our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be, and we've launched 2 initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery.
Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures and performing comprehensive risk assessments when task or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, but as expected, our cost rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program, focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability.
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and expansions into production. And 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas.
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. We recently delivered 2 profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground on the 1st of July, which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for $42 million, just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This expansion adds higher-grade, lower-cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030.
Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This expansion adds lower-cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with 2 autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills. And we've set up underground WiFi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected.
In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is wrapping up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth.  However, we're beginning to see early signs that input cost, including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates, could put pressure on our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks.
Turning to our latest investment and the future on Slide 10. This morning, we announced agreements to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek in the form of partnership with Teck, who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in 3 stages: on completion of the pre-feasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project. We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio, and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strength and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for pre-feasibility studies over the next several months and manage the projects through a joint steering committee.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 12 for the highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter driven by lower sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher realized gold price, adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017.
Cash from continuing operations was $401 million compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments.
Turning to Slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, and we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities, including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018.
And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15."

As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we safely completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget. And we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to deweight the slip in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore.
At CC&V, production was impacted by lower leach recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months. In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. [ These ] will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018.
Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins in the next layback of the Mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower-cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend profitable production in North America. And finally, studies into the next phase for Long Canyon are continuing on course.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year. Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward. And our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian, and we are starting to deliver further improvements.
At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has helped offset slow leach recoveries. And we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower-cost oxides over deep transitional ore. We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing, and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha Sulfides to reach definitive feasibility late this year.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston Pit in mid-May. The mine's detection systems identified movement prior to the event, and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit, however, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rates have been reduced, and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between 280,000 and 330,000 ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall events and are engaged with the effective underwriters.
[indiscernible] underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally, and the site is able to process stockpiled ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer-term impacts, including mine plan reevaluations.
We have received the APA permit for the Morrison layback and subject to the mine plan reviews, still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year.
At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with higher production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018, and it will continue through 2019.
At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted, and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil work for the power stations is well underway, and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach.
Turning to Africa on Slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit cost increased due to high inventory costs driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between $880 and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance. Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and are in the process of safely restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo Mill Expansion schedule will shift first gold into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the total capital estimate.
Subika Underground continues to ramp up. And despite minor delays in construction surface infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo Underground, and we progressed the Akyem Underground project pre-feasibility. This next stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence.
Turning to the rest of the year on Slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering our highest production and lowest cost in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged, and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018.
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 21."
291795,571333670,1510876,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success.

We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that we will improve -- that will improve our margins, reserves and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline.
Turning to Slide 23. Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook but were removed from the pipeline at completion. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This quarter, we advanced Akyem Underground from scoping to pre-feasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 -- developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore processed through the existing mill.
Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a pre-feasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. This is our expected production profile for the next 7 years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects: Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage and will maintain that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration.
Turning to Slide 25. In North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the pre-feasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon, and we plan to test 8 different drill targets this year. Finally, we will begin scoping pre-feasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over 3 to 4 years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake.
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And we're working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medellin and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish [ our ] presence and relationships in the country.
In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia.
Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair-lined agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement.
Putting it all together on Slide 26. We delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long time horizon, invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time.

As we work through our longer-term plans, looking it up -- and a lot of the work today was about safely understanding the impact of that slip and understanding the impact for this year. So work is still underway in terms of the longer-term impact and the various scenarios around that. A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we're doing at that east wall, how we might layback that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we need to do to better inform that approach. So that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and then understand the longer-term impacts beyond 2018 and then how we access the greater Morrison resource. But we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit, and there's some material on the western wall as well that we will be stacking that's been sitting underneath the west wall slip. And we'll continue to process stockpiled ore through the mill. So the processing plant -- well, the 3 processing plants at KCGM are still running at full rates. And in fact, they're running at rates that we haven't seen since 2005. So we're maximizing the processing through the plant to minimize the impact from the slip."

And we're now commissioning a cleaner concentrate circuit that would reduce a higher grade, particularly in sulfur coming out of the CC&V plant. So that gold and sulfur will go into Mill 6.

So everything we're doing is consistent with what we're required to do and in terms of the agreements we've had in place. But we've been involved in good faith dialogue with community leaders, with the people who are raising those concerns and working through a mediation process to reach a form of resolution there with them. And that process has been progressing over a period of time. What you saw in more recent times is the group, which we're quite comfortable with, staged demonstration to further support their claim, so that took place, a peaceful demonstration, over a few hours, a couple of days ago, so that -- the activity was related to that. We continue to engage in good faith dialogue to reach a resolution with those people who are raising those concerns."

And thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a resul",1348,"Thank you, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was a result of a study focused on meeting our commitments; to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient; to deliver 2 projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget; and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio; and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance.
Turning to more details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, keeping us in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance. And we continued to improve costs and efficiency. I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week, where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian's fleet. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allowed the team at Merian to investigate and correct the problem that could have caused serious engine damage.
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower cost production in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world-class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance pre-feasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio. And we had about 85 drill rigs operating around the world to advance brownfields and greenfields prospects.
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investor-grade credit rating and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.
Turn to Slide 5. While our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be, and we've launched 2 initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery.
Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures and performing comprehensive risk assessments when task or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community.
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, but as expected, our cost rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program, focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability.
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and expansions into production. And 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas.
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. We recently delivered 2 profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground on the 1st of July, which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for $42 million, just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This expansion adds higher-grade, lower-cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030.
Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This expansion adds lower-cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with 2 autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills. And we've set up underground WiFi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected.
In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is wrapping up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These 6 projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.
Turning to Slide 9. Newmont's 5-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth.  However, we're beginning to see early signs that input cost, including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates, could put pressure on our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks.
Turning to our latest investment and the future on Slide 10. This morning, we announced agreements to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek in the form of partnership with Teck, who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in 3 stages: on completion of the pre-feasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project. We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio, and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strength and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for pre-feasibility studies over the next several months and manage the projects through a joint steering committee.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our second quarter financial results."

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter driven by lower sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher realized gold price, adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017.
Cash from continuing operations was $401 million compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments.
Turning to Slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share.
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, and we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities, including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018.
And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15."
291795,571333670,1510966,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nancy.

As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we safely completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget. And we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to deweight the slip in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore.
At CC&V, production was impacted by lower leach recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months. In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. [ These ] will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018.
Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins in the next layback of the Mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects, adding lower-cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend profitable production in North America. And finally, studies into the next phase for Long Canyon are continuing on course.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year. Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward. And our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian, and we are starting to deliver further improvements.
At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has helped offset slow leach recoveries. And we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower-cost oxides over deep transitional ore. We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing, and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha Sulfides to reach definitive feasibility late this year.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston Pit in mid-May. The mine's detection systems identified movement prior to the event, and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit, however, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rates have been reduced, and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between 280,000 and 330,000 ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall events and are engaged with the effective underwriters.
[indiscernible] underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally, and the site is able to process stockpiled ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer-term impacts, including mine plan reevaluations.
We have received the APA permit for the Morrison layback and subject to the mine plan reviews, still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year.
At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with higher production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018, and it will continue through 2019.
At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted, and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil work for the power stations is well underway, and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach.
Turning to Africa on Slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit cost increased due to high inventory costs driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between $880 and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance. Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and are in the process of safely restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo Mill Expansion schedule will shift first gold into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the total capital estimate.
Subika Underground continues to ramp up. And despite minor delays in construction surface infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo Underground, and we progressed the Akyem Underground project pre-feasibility. This next stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence.
Turning to the rest of the year on Slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering our highest production and lowest cost in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged, and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018.
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 21."
291795,571333670,1510966,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount",739,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to focus on operating and growing our business in 4 regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that we will improve -- that will improve our margins, reserves and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline.
Turning to Slide 23. Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana and Quecher Main in Peru. Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook but were removed from the pipeline at completion. A midterm project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This quarter, we advanced Akyem Underground from scoping to pre-feasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 -- developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore processed through the existing mill.
Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a pre-feasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.
Turning to Slide 24. This is our expected production profile for the next 7 years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm Ahafo North project, which is not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows 2 longer-term feasibility projects: Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage and will maintain that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration.
Turning to Slide 25. In North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the pre-feasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon, and we plan to test 8 different drill targets this year. Finally, we will begin scoping pre-feasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over 3 to 4 years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake.
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And we're working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medellin and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish [ our ] presence and relationships in the country.
In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia.
Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair-lined agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement.
Putting it all together on Slide 26. We delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long time horizon, invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time.

Long Canyon, we continue the development of Phase 2, some interesting things around immigrant that we're taking a look at. So as we use both current technology and continue to extend the use of our Deep Sensing Geochemistry to better understand things that may be covered at depths that we haven't actually looked at, most of what's been discovered today has had some sort of a surface exposure or been accidentally found by a water well or something.

As we work through our longer-term plans, looking it up -- and a lot of the work today was about safely understanding the impact of that slip and understanding the impact for this year. So work is still underway in terms of the longer-term impact and the various scenarios around that. A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we're doing at that east wall, how we might layback that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we need to do to better inform that approach. So that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and then understand the longer-term impacts beyond 2018 and then how we access the greater Morrison resource. But we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit, and there's some material on the western wall as well that we will be stacking that's been sitting underneath the west wall slip. And we'll continue to process stockpiled ore through the mill. So the processing plant -- well, the 3 processing plants at KCGM are still running at full rates. And in fact, they're running at rates that we haven't seen since 2005. So we're maximizing the processing through the plant to minimize the impact from the slip."

You will certainly see -- there's 2 things that stockpiled ore will start -- stockpiled concentrate will start to move through the third and fourth quarter. We'll stockpile them because we had to do some improvements to a county road that are now complete. So we're ramping up shipments as we speak. And we're now commissioning a cleaner concentrate circuit that would reduce a higher grade, particularly in sulfur coming out of the CC&V plant. So that gold and sulfur will go into Mill 6. So it provides a heat source that allows us to put higher grade Carlin ore through Mill 6. So we'll see some benefit at Carlin as a result of that fuel source that comes from that concentrate. We're still very much on target to hit our guidance for CC&V. So if you just look at the first half and extrapolate to where we're predicting guidance to be for the year, you get a measure of the impact of shipping that concentrate to Nevada is going to have on CC&V gold production for the full year and in particular, the second half."

And now I'll turn it over to Gary on Slide 3."
291795,582196412,1577684,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continue to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently,",1312,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continue to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently, sustaining a global portfolio of long life assets by advancing profitable expansion and exploration on 4 continents and leading in profitability and responsibility. 
Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost 2 decades and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team. More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over 5 years ago, which is reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with a focus on capital discipline and industry-leading returns. 
Turning back to the third quarter details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program in advancing our 3 most promising digital initiatives, including Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long life assets. During the third quarter, in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrates project. In South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September and mining continues on schedule. In Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study. And in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold and Orosur Mining projects in Colombia. We were excited about Colombia's perspective gold districts and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project which does not currently meet our expectations. 
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment-grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we are recognized as the mining sector leader in the Dow Jones attainability index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. While the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up and there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible, felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verification to critical controls with the completion rate of 99% year-to-date. 
So previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again; highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources like water; demonstrating best practices in corporate governance, codes of business conduct and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. As expected, our costs rise in 2018 as we execute planed stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Year-to-date, costs have decreased to $973 per ounce, which is consistent with our second half weighting. And we lowered and narrowed our 2018 AISC outlook to $950 to $990 per ounce, driven by continued outperformance at Boddington, Akyem and other sites across our portfolio, partially offset by higher costs at Carlin. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter as we reach higher grades in Africa and South America and increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada. And earlier this month, we poured our [ millionth ] ounce of gold at Merian after just 2 years of operation. Due to recent geotechnical events at Carlin, we narrowed our full year production guidance to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million attributable ounces. Tom will cover this update in more detail later. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our highest production in the fourth quarter on the back of planned higher grades at Leeville, Yanacocha and Ahafo. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. In the third quarter, we delivered 2 profitable projects in North America with Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus. Both of these projects extend mine life and and add lower-cost production. And we are currently executing 4 projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In Africa, we remain on track at Subika Underground, which will add higher grade, lower-cost production. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion has ramped up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're extending oxide production with Quecher Main, and we placed first ore in September. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. And finally, in Australia, we're making good progress on the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage. In North America, we continue to pursue underground expansions at Carlin and are progressing prefeasibility studies for Long Canyon Phase 2. And we've begun scoping the Galore Creek prefeasibility studies with Teck Resources. Finally, we recently partnered with Evrim Resources to advance the exploration of Cuale, a perspective gold project in Mexico. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And as I previously mentioned, we are working with Continental Gold to support development of the Buriticá project. We're also pursuing a range of other promising exploration prospects in Colombia, Chile, Suriname and French Guiana, where we've recently began drilling at the Esperance site shown in this picture. In Africa, we're advancing studies of underground deposits at Ahafo and Akyem and continue to progress the Ahafo North project. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we've advanced our second expansion at Tanami, which Tom will touch on further, and continue to explore greenfield targets across the continent. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 10 to discuss our third quarter financial results."
291795,582196412,1577684,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 11 for the highlights. I am pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income",478,"Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 11 for the highlights. I am pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income of $175 million or $0.33 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. Cash from continuing operations was $428 million compared to $489 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower metal prices and unfavorable changes in working capital. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. For the third quarter, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.31 per diluted share, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets at exploration properties and immigrant in North America. As shown on the slide, these impairments were adjusted for a total of $0.74 per diluted share. Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.14 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.04 related to a change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities and gains on asset and investment sales. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 13. Newmont continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. And we remain well positioned to execute on our capital priorities, including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Yesterday, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are on track to return nearly $400 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends in our share buyback program, which aims to maintain a constant share count. 
We also continue to support increased financial transparency in the gold sector. Over the last several months, we've led a working group with the World Gold Council and our peers to provide greater clarity and consistency for all-in sustaining cost reporting. The Council expects to issue an updated AISC guidance note next month with the January 1, 2019, effective date. For Newmont, the proposed changes are expected to lower our AISC due to the exclusion and reclassification of non-sustaining costs related to activities such as exploration, advanced projects and R&D. Historically, we've taken a more conservative approach when reporting AISC, and we believe the changes will make our cost basis more comparable to our gold industry peers. We will provide additional details on these changes and reconcile to our past methodology when we issue our 2019 guidance on December 5. 
And now I'll hand it to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 14."
291795,582196412,1577684,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 15. Year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production in",996,"Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 15. Year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production increased following the planned Mill 6 shut -- maintenance shut in Q2. And we started to see higher grades as expected from our underground mines. At our service mines, we continue to actively monitor and manage geotechnical risks. At Silverstar, our work continues to remediate the 2016 slip, and we still plan to exit higher grade ore in the fourth quarter. However, after experiencing further wall movement during the third quarter, we had stepped out to manage this issue. As a consequence, we are targeting a smaller mining footprint in this pit. In early October, we also experienced a wall slip at our Gold Quarry pit. The detection measures we put in place identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining in this pit is currently suspended, and our teams are working through an assessment of mine plans and next steps to safely restart mining. As a result of these challenges, we lowered Carlin 2019 production outlook. We now expect the North America region to produce approximately 1.9 million to 2.1 million ounces. 
As Gary mentioned, at CC&V, we completed the concentrate project. The cleaner flotation circuit is performing to design, and we are ramping up concentrate deliveries to Nevada. We expect a strong finish to the year as we continue to draw down stockpiled concentrates and process them through Carlin's Mill 6. 
Twin Creeks delivered improve costs and grade following the completion of Twin Underground in July. And at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue to advance, as to our new mine declaration programs assessing the next wave of expansion across the region. 
Turning to South America on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, earlier this month, after just 2 years in operation, Merian record its 1 million pounds. I'm tremendously proud of the team for safely achieving this milestone. In the third quarter, Merian delivered solid results through continued mine and mill productivity improvements. We declared the primary crusher ready for intended use in early September. This new crusher will help sustain mill throughput and enable the processing of fresh rock beginning early next year. We also expect productivity at Merian to increase over time with the recent addition of 4 new whole trucks combined with the ongoing improvements ramp for potential program. 
At Yanacocha, we reached higher grade ore in the [ topato ] estate pit and continue to see the benefits from our optimized mill blending strategy. Quecher Main stripping is ramping up, and we placed first ore on an existing leach pad in September as construction of the new leach pad continues. Studies at Chaquicocha Oxides continue to advance with brisk development to the North and South completed, serving as a platform for the exploration drilling we have underway. The Yanacocha Sulfides, we plan to extend our feasibility study work by a few months to allow us to optimize our Carlin storage strategy and complete the associated engineering. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of 2019 and make a full fund decision in 2020. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 17. At Tanami, we delivered strong third quarter performance with higher grades and sustained improvements in mill throughput. The Tanami Power project continues on course. Construction activities at the power stations are ongoing, and the gas pipeline trenching and welding is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to deliver this project in the first quarter of 2019. At Boddington, our optimized mill maintenance strategy has helped improve productivity and costs, and we now expect a lower 2019 all-in sustaining cost of between [ $880 ] and $930 per ounce. Our planned stripping campaign will ramp up through the remainder of this year and continue through 2019. At KCGM, we continue to manage the impact from wall slips early this year. Mining rates have been reduced, however, we continue to mine and process ore from the Super Pit and Mt. Charlotte underground, supplemented with stockpiled ore. 
During the quarter, we finalized insurance claim of $25 million for our share of lost profits. Considerable work is also underway to assess the longer-term impacts, and we expect to provide more information in early December. 
Looking to the future, we recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study and anticipate reaching an investment decision in the second half of 2019, followed by a 3-year construction period. For investment of approximately $650 million to $750 million, this project is expected to add an incremental 100,000 ounces of annual production from 2023 through 2027. The project is not included in our current guidance. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 18. Africa again delivered solid results on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance. At Akyem, continued outperformance allowed us to lower our 2018 all-in sustaining cost for the Africa region to $820 to $860 per ounce. Looking ahead at Ahafo, commissioning is underway on the Subika Underground surface infrastructure, and the project continues to progress on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. The project is expected to add 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of higher grade, lower cost production annually over the next 5 years. Construction activities at the Ahafo Mill Expansion resumed in August, and the team is making good progress on civil works at both the SAG mill and primary crusher. During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the installation of the new pebble crusher and CAL tanks. We remain on track to achieve commercial production during the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies focused on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 19."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions where we have the stability and operating model that we need to create value over the long term. We began transforming our business 6 years ago, and I remain very proud of the team for the work done to set our business up for success over the long term by optimizing the portfolio through the monetization of noncore assets, advancing profitable growth on all continents, adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining cost of about $750 per ounce, investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia and restoring our balance sheet to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our most promising projects and prospects. All of these attributes give us the optionality and the ability to stay disciplined in how we pursue value creation and generate returns for shareholders. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to Slide 21. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia and Quecher Main in Peru. Two midterm projects that will improve our outlook are Ahafo North and the recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2, both shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund these projects in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to Slide 22. This gives you a feel for our production profiles for the next 7 years. Annual gold production is forecast to remain at around 5 million attributable ounces, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over that same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, both midterm projects, which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the Yanacocha Sulfides, a longer-term feasibility project representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
Putting it all together on Slide 23. We delivered strong third quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We'll continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer time horizon, invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business and to lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold.

So Silverstar on the North part of Carlin and Gold Quarry is in the south part, so they're a good 20 miles apart across that Carlin complex. In Silverstar, the work we've done through the third quarter to step out and manage some of the activity we saw through the third quarter, that's all in good shape. We're in ore and we'll be mining there from now until the end of the first quarter. And that really sees the end of the Silverstar pit. And it's the order of about [ 160,000 ] ounces to come out of here, so that is factored into our guidance, the remaining part of this year. Gold Quarry, the area that slipped, it says -- as I think John said, it is a mature pit, and the area that slipped was some alluvial material at the very top of that, so a wall that has been sitting for quite some time. So we've got some work to do to step through and understand the mechanisms for what happened there and then develop a remediation plan to get back and accessing ore out of Gold Quarry. A lot of the work in Gold Quarry for the short to medium term is actually stripping. And Gold Quarry is one of -- for the Carlin complex, Gold Quarry is one of 5 open pits that were in mining, multiple underground mines and then notable stockpile sources. So the overall impact of Gold Quarry, to put it in perspective, year-to-date Gold Quarry has contributed about 100,000 ounces of Carlin's production. So there are a number of other things we can do to source ore for the processing plants at Carlin whilst we work through how to best remediate that section of the Gold Quarry pit."

291795,582196412,1578218,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently,",1310,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently, sustaining a global portfolio of long-life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on 4 continents and leading in profitability and responsibility. 
Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost 2 decades and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team. More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over 5 years ago, which is reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with a focus on capital discipline and industry-leading returns. 
Turning back to the third quarter details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program in advancing our 3 most promising digital initiatives, including Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the third quarter, in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrate project. In South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September and mining continues on schedule. In Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study. And in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold and Orosur Mining projects in Colombia. We remain excited about Colombia's perspective gold districts and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project, which does not currently meet our expectations. 
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment-grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we are recognized as the mining sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. While the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up and there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible, felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verifications to critical controls with the completion rate of 99% year-to-date. 
So previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again, highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources like water; demonstrating best practices in corporate governance, codes of business conduct and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But as expected, our costs rise in 2018 as we execute planned stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Year-to-date, costs have decreased to $973 per ounce, which is consistent with our second half weighting. And we lowered and narrowed our 2018 AISC outlook to $950 to $990 per ounce, driven by continued outperformance at Boddington, Akyem and other sites across our portfolio, partially offset by higher costs at Carlin. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter as we reach higher grades in Africa and South America and increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada. And earlier this month, we poured our millions ounce of gold at Merian after just 2 years of operation. Due to recent geotechnical events at Carlin, we narrowed our full year production guidance to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million attributable ounces. Tom will cover this update in more detail later. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our highest production in the fourth quarter on the back of planned higher grades at Leeville, Yanacocha and Ahafo. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. In the third quarter, we delivered 2 profitable projects in North America with Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus. Both of these projects extend mine life and add lower cost production. And we are currently executing 4 projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In Africa, we remain on track at Subika Underground, which will add higher grade, lower cost production. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion has ramped up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're extending oxide production with Quecher Main, and we placed first ore in September. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. And finally, in Australia, we're making good progress on the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage. In North America, we continue to pursue underground expansions at Carlin and are progressing pre-feasibility studies for Long Canyon Phase 2. And we've begun scoping the Galore Creek pre-feasibility studies with Teck Resources. Finally, we recently partnered with Evrim Resources to advance the exploration of Cuale, a perspective gold project in Mexico. 
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And as I previously mentioned, we are working with Continental Gold to support development of the Buriticá project. We're also pursuing a range of other promising exploration prospects in Colombia, Chile, Suriname and French Guiana, where we've recently began drilling at the Esperance site shown in this picture. 
In Africa, we're advancing studies of underground deposits at Ahafo and Akyem and continue to progress the Ahafo North project, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. 
Finally, in Australia, we've advanced our second expansion at Tanami, which Tom will touch on further, and continue to explore greenfield targets across the continent. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 10 to discuss our third quarter financial results."

I'm pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income of $175 million or $0.33 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. Cash from continuing operations was $428 million compared to $489 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower metal prices and unfavorable changes in working capital. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. For the third quarter, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.31 per diluted share, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets at exploration properties in Emigrant in North America. As shown on the slide, these impairments were adjusted for a total of $0.74 per diluted share. Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.14 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.04 related to a change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities and gains on asset and investment sales. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 13. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. And we remain well positioned to execute on our capital priorities, including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Yesterday, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are on track to return nearly $400 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends in our share buyback program, which aims to maintain a constant share count. 
We also continue to support increased financial transparency in the gold sector. Over the last several months, we've led a working group with the World Gold Council and our peers to provide greater clarity and consistency for all-in sustaining cost reporting. The Council expects to issue an updated AISC guidance note next month with the January 1, 2019, effective date. For Newmont, the proposed changes are expected to lower our AISC due to the exclusion and reclassification of nonsustaining costs related to activities, such as exploration, advanced projects and R&D. Historically, we've taken a more conservative approach when reporting AISC, and we believe the changes will make our cost basis more comparable to our gold industry peers. We will provide additional details on these changes and reconcile to our past methodology when we issue our 2019 guidance on December 5. 
And now I'll hand it to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 14."

For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production in",994,"Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 15. Year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production increased following the planned Mill 6 shut -- maintenance shut in Q2, and we started to see higher grades as expected from our underground mines. At our service mines, we continued to actively monitor and manage geotechnical risks. At Silverstar, our work continues to remediate the 2016 slip, and we still plan to access higher grade ore in the fourth quarter. However, after experiencing further wall movement during the third quarter, we have stepped out to manage this issue. As a consequence, we are targeting a smaller mining footprint in this pit. In early October, we also experienced a wall slip at our Gold Quarry pit. The detection measures we put in place identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining in this pit is currently suspended, and our teams are working through an assessment of mine plans and next steps to safely restart mining. As a result of these challenges, we lowered Carlin's 2019 production outlook. We now expect the North America region to produce approximately 1.9 million to 2.1 million ounces. 
As Gary mentioned, at CC&V, we completed the concentrate project. The cleaner flotation circuit is performing to design, and we are ramping up concentrate deliveries to Nevada. We expect a strong finish to the year as we continue to draw down stockpiled concentrates and process them through Carlin's Mill 6. 
Twin Creeks delivered improved costs and grade, following the completion of Twin Underground in July. And at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue to advance, as to our new mine exploration programs assessing the next wave of expansion across the region. 
Turning to South America on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, earlier this month, after just 2 years in operation, Merian record its 1 million pounds. I'm tremendously proud of the team for safely achieving this milestone. In the third quarter, Merian delivered solid results through continued mine and mill productivity improvements. We declared the primary crusher ready for intended use in early September. This new crusher will help sustain mill throughput and enable the processing of fresh rock beginning early next year. We also expect productivity at Merian to increase over time with the recent addition of 4 new whole trucks combined with the ongoing improvements ramp full potential program. 
At Yanacocha, we reached higher grade ore in El Tapado estate pit and continue to see the benefits from our optimized mill blending strategy. Quecher Main stripping is ramping up, and we placed first ore on an existing leach pad in September as construction of the new leach pad continues. Studies at Chaquicocha Oxides continue to advance with drift development to the North and South completed, serving as a platform for the exploration drilling we have underway. The Yanacocha Sulfides, we plan to extend our feasibility study work by a few months to allow us to optimize our Carlin storage strategy and complete the associated engineering. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of 2019 and make a full funds decision in 2020. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 17. At Tanami, we delivered strong third quarter performance with higher grades and sustained improvements in mill throughput. The Tanami Power project continues on course. Construction activities at the power stations are ongoing, and the gas pipeline trenching and welding is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to deliver this project in the first quarter of 2019. At Boddington, our optimized mill maintenance strategy has helped improve productivity and costs, and we now expect a lower 2019 all-in sustaining cost of between $880 and $930 per ounce. Our planned stripping campaign will ramp up through the remainder of this year and continue through 2019. At KCGM, we continue to manage the impact from wall slips early this year. Mining rates have been reduced, however, we continue to mine and process ore from the Super Pit and Mt. Charlotte underground, supplemented with stockpiled ore. 
During the quarter, we finalized the insurance claim of $25 million for our share of lost profits. Considerable work is also underway to assess the longer-term impacts, and we expect to provide more information in early December. 
Looking to the future, we recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study and anticipate reaching an investment decision in the second half of 2019, followed by a 3-year construction period. For an investment of approximately $650 million to $750 million, this project is expected to add an incremental 100,000 ounces of annual production from 2023 through 2027. The project is not included in our current guidance. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 18. Africa again delivered solid results on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance. At Akyem, continued outperformance allowed us to lower our 2018 all-in sustaining cost for the Africa region to $820 to $860 per ounce. Looking ahead at Ahafo, commissioning is underway on the Subika Underground surface infrastructure, and the project continues to progress on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. The project is expected to add 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of higher grade, lower cost production annually over the next 5 years. Construction activities at the Ahafo Mill Expansion resumed in August, and the team is making good progress on civil works at both the Sag Mill and primary crusher. During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the installation of the new pebble crusher and CIL tanks. We remain on track to achieve commercial production during the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies focused on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 19."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions where we have the stability and operating model that we need to create value over the long term. We began transforming our business 6 years ago, and I remain very proud of the team for the work done to set our business up for success over the long term by optimizing the portfolio through the monetization of noncore assets; advancing profitable growth on all continents, adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining cost of about $750 per ounce; investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia; and restoring our balance sheet to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our most promising projects and prospects. All of these attributes give us the optionality and the ability to stay disciplined in how we pursue value creation and generate returns for shareholders. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to Slide 21. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia and Quecher Main in Peru. Two mid-term projects that will improve our outlook are Ahafo North and the recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2, both shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund these projects in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to Slide 22. This gives you a feel for our production profiles for the next 7 years. Annual gold production is forecast to remain at around 5 million attributable ounces, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over that same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, both mid-term projects, which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the Yanacocha Sulfides, a longer-term feasibility project representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
Putting it all together on Slide 23. We delivered strong third quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We'll continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

We have been mining from there all year. But as we commissioned the fans, the ventilation fans and the refrigeration plant, it allows more air in the underground mine and allows us to increase our mining rates. So you'll see some more tons coming out of the mine and the better grades you get from Subika.

So Silverstar is in the North part of Carlin and Gold Quarry is in the south part, so they are good 20 miles apart across that Carlin complex. In Silverstar, the work we've done through the third quarter to step out and manage some of the activity we saw through the third quarter, that's all in good shape. We're in ore, and we'll be mining there from now until the end of the first quarter. And that really sees the end of the Silverstar pit, and there's the order of about 160,000 ounces to come out of here. So that's factored into our guidance, the remaining part of this year. Gold Quarry, the area that slipped, it says -- as I think John said, it is a mature pit, and the area that slipped was some alluvial material at the very top of that pit, so a wall that has been sitting for quite some time. So we've got some work to do to step through and understand the mechanisms for what happened there and then develop a remediation plan to get back in and accessing ore out of Gold Quarry. A lot of the work in Gold Quarry for the short to medium term is actually stripping. And Gold Quarry is one of -- for the Carlin complex, Gold Quarry is one of 5 open pits that were in mining, multiple underground mines and then notable stockpile sources. So the overall impact to Gold Quarry, put it in perspective, year-to-date, Gold Quarry has contributed about 100,000 ounces of Carlin's production. So it's -- there are a number of other things we can do to source ore for the processing plants at Carlin whilst we work through how to best remediate that section of the Gold Quarry pit."

We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently;",1310,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently; sustaining a global portfolio of long-life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on 4 continents; and leading in profitability and responsibility. 
Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost 2 decades and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team. More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over 5 years ago, which is reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with a focus on capital discipline and industry-leading returns. 
Turning back to the third quarter details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program in advancing our 3 most promising digital initiatives, including Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the third quarter, in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrate project. In South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September and mining continues on schedule. In Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study. And in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold and Orosur Mining projects in Colombia. We remain excited about Colombia's perspective gold districts and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project, which does not currently meet our expectations. 
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment-grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we are recognized as the mining sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. While the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up and there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible, felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verifications to critical controls with the completion rate of 99% year-to-date. 
So previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again, highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources, like water; demonstrating best practices in corporate governance, codes of business conduct and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But as expected, our costs rise in 2018 as we execute planned stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Year-to-date, costs have decreased to $973 per ounce, which is consistent with our second half weighting. And we lowered and narrowed our 2018 AISC outlook to $950 to $990 per ounce, driven by continued outperformance at Boddington, Akyem and other sites across our portfolio, partially offset by higher costs at Carlin. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter as we reached higher grades in Africa and South America and increased processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada. And earlier this month, we poured our millions ounce of gold at Merian after just 2 years of operation. Due to recent geotechnical events at Carlin, we narrowed our full year production guidance to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million attributable ounces. Tom will cover this update in more detail later. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our highest production in the fourth quarter on the back of planned higher grades at Leeville, Yanacocha and Ahafo. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. In the third quarter, we delivered 2 profitable projects in North America with Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus. Both of these projects extend mine life and add lower cost production. And we are currently executing 4 projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In Africa, we remain on track at Subika Underground, which will add higher grade, lower cost production. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion has ramped up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're extending oxide production with Quecher Main, and we placed first ore in September. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. And finally, in Australia, we're making good progress on the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage. In North America, we continue to pursue underground expansions at Carlin and are progressing pre-feasibility studies for Long Canyon Phase 2. And we've begun scoping the Galore Creek pre-feasibility studies with Teck Resources. Finally, we recently partnered with Evrim Resources to advance the exploration of Cuale, a perspective gold project in Mexico. 
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And as I previously mentioned, we are working with Continental Gold to support development of the Buriticá project. We're also pursuing a range of other promising exploration prospects in Colombia, Chile, Suriname and French Guiana, where we've recently began drilling at the Esperance site shown in this picture. 
In Africa, we're advancing studies of underground deposits at Ahafo and Akyem and continue to progress the Ahafo North project, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. 
Finally, in Australia, we've advanced our second expansion at Tanami, which Tom will touch on further, and continue to explore greenfield targets across the continent. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 10 to discuss our third quarter financial results."

I'm pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income of $175 million or $0.33 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. Cash from continuing operations was $428 million compared to $489 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower metal prices and unfavorable changes in working capital. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. For the third quarter, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.31 per diluted share, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets at exploration properties in Emigrant in North America. As shown on the slide, these impairments were adjusted for a total of $0.74 per diluted share. Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.14 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.04 related to a change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities and gains on asset and investment sales. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 13. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. And we remain well positioned to execute on our capital priorities, including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Yesterday, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are on track to return nearly $400 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends in our share buyback program, which aims to maintain a constant share count. 
We also continue to support increased financial transparency in the gold sector. Over the last several months, we've led a working group with the World Gold Council and our peers to provide greater clarity and consistency for all-in sustaining cost reporting. The Council expects to issue an updated AISC guidance note next month with the January 1, 2019, effective date. For Newmont, the proposed changes are expected to lower our AISC due to the exclusion and reclassification of nonsustaining costs related to activities, such as exploration, advanced projects and R&D. Historically, we've taken a more conservative approach when reporting AISC, and we believe the changes will make our cost basis more comparable to our gold industry peers. We will provide additional details on these changes and reconcile to our past methodology when we issue our 2019 guidance on December 5. 
And now I'll hand it to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 14."
291795,582196412,1578480,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 15.

Year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production increased following the planned Mill 6 shut -- maintenance shut in Q2, and we started to see higher grades as expected from our underground mines. At our service mines, we continued to actively monitor and manage geotechnical risks. At Silverstar, our work continues to remediate the 2016 slip, and we still plan to access higher grade ore in the fourth quarter. However, after experiencing further wall movement during the third quarter, we have stepped out to manage this issue. As a consequence, we are targeting a smaller mining footprint in this pit. In early October, we also experienced a wall slip at our Gold Quarry pit. The detection measures we put in place identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining in this pit is currently suspended, and our teams are working through an assessment of mine plans and next steps to safely restart mining. As a result of these challenges, we lowered Carlin's 2019 production outlook. We now expect the North America region to produce approximately 1.9 million to 2.1 million ounces. 
As Gary mentioned, at CC&V, we completed the concentrate project. The cleaner flotation circuit is performing to design, and we are ramping up concentrate deliveries to Nevada. We expect a strong finish to the year as we continue to draw down stockpiled concentrates and process them through Carlin's Mill 6. 
Twin Creeks delivered improved costs and grade, following the completion of Twin Underground in July. And at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue to advance, as to our new mine exploration programs assessing the next wave of expansion across the region. 
Turning to South America on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, earlier this month, after just 2 years in operation, Merian poured its 1 millionth ounce. I'm tremendously proud of the team for safely achieving this milestone. In the third quarter, Merian delivered solid results through continued mine and mill productivity improvements. We declared the primary crusher ready for intended use in early September. This new crusher will help sustain mill throughput and enable the processing of fresh rock beginning early next year. We also expect productivity at Merian to increase over time with the recent addition of 4 new whole trucks combined with the ongoing improvements ramp full potential program. 
At Yanacocha, we reached higher grade ore in El Tapado estate pit and continue to see the benefits from our optimized mill blending strategy. Quecher Main stripping is ramping up, and we placed first ore on an existing leach pad in September as construction of the new leach pad continues. Studies at Chaquicocha Oxides continue to advance with drift development to the north and south completed, serving as a platform for the exploration drilling we have underway. The Yanacocha Sulfides, we plan to extend our feasibility study work by a few months to allow us to optimize our Carlin storage strategy and complete the associated engineering. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of 2019 and make a full funds decision in 2020. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 17. At Tanami, we delivered strong third quarter performance with higher grades and sustained improvements in mill throughput. The Tanami Power project continues on course. Construction activities at the power stations are ongoing, and the gas pipeline trenching and welding is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to deliver this project in the first quarter of 2019. At Boddington, our optimized mill maintenance strategy has helped improve productivity and costs, and we now expect a lower 2019 all-in sustaining cost of between $880 and $930 per ounce. Our planned stripping campaign will ramp up through the remainder of this year and continue through 2019. At KCGM, we continue to manage the impact from wall slips early this year. Mining rates have been reduced, however, we continue to mine and process ore from the Super Pit and Mt. Charlotte underground, supplemented with stockpiled ore. 
During the quarter, we finalized the insurance claim of $25 million for our share of lost profits. Considerable work is also underway to assess the longer-term impacts, and we expect to provide more information in early December. 
Looking to the future, we recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study and anticipate reaching an investment decision in the second half of 2019, followed by a 3-year construction period. For an investment of approximately $650 million to $750 million, this project is expected to add an incremental 100,000 ounces of annual production from 2023 through 2027. The project is not included in our current guidance. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 18. Africa again delivered solid results on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance. At Akyem, continued outperformance allowed us to lower our 2018 all-in sustaining costs for the Africa region to $820 to $860 per ounce. Looking ahead at Ahafo, commissioning is underway on the Subika Underground surface infrastructure, and the project continues to progress on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. The project is expected to add 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of higher grade, lower cost production annually over the next 5 years. Construction activities at the Ahafo Mill Expansion resumed in August, and the team is making good progress on civil works at both the Sag Mill and primary crusher. During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the installation of the new pebble crusher and CIL tanks. We remain on track to achieve commercial production during the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies focused on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 19."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions where we have the stability and operating model that we need to create value over the long term. We began transforming our business 6 years ago, and I remain very proud of the team for the work done to set our business up for success over the long term by optimizing the portfolio through the monetization of noncore assets; advancing profitable growth on all continents, adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of about $750 per ounce; investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia; and restoring our balance sheet to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our most promising projects and prospects. All of these attributes give us the optionality and the ability to stay disciplined in how we pursue value creation and generate returns for shareholders. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to Slide 21. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia and Quecher Main in Peru. Two mid-term projects that will improve our outlook are Ahafo North and the recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2, both shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund these projects in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to Slide 22. This gives you a feel for our production profile for the next 7 years. Annual gold production is forecast to remain at around 5 million attributable ounces, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over that same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, both mid-term projects, which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the Yanacocha Sulfides, a longer-term feasibility project representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
Putting it all together on Slide 23. We delivered strong third quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We'll continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

We have been mining from there all year. But as we commissioned the fans, the ventilation fans and the refrigeration plant, it allows more air in the underground mine and allows us to increase our mining rate. So you'll see some more tons coming out of the mine and the better grades you get from Subika.

So Silverstar is in the north part of Carlin and Gold Quarry is in the south part, so they are good 20 miles apart across that Carlin complex. In Silverstar, the work we've done through the third quarter to step out and manage some of the activity we saw through the third quarter, that's all in good shape. We're in ore, and we'll be mining there from now until the end of the first quarter. And that really sees the end of the Silverstar pit, and there's the order of about 160,000 ounces to come out of here. So that's factored into our guidance, the remaining part of this year. Gold Quarry, the area that slipped, it says -- as I think John said, it is a mature pit, and the area that slipped was some alluvial material at the very top of that pit, so a wall that had been sitting for quite some time. So we've got some work to do to step through and understand the mechanisms for what happened there and then develop a remediation plan to get back in and accessing ore out of Gold Quarry. A lot of the work in Gold Quarry for the short to medium term is actually stripping. And Gold Quarry is one of -- for the Carlin complex, Gold Quarry is one of 5 open pits that we're mining, multiple underground mines and then multiple stockpile sources. So the overall impact to Gold Quarry, put it in perspective, year-to-date, Gold Quarry has contributed about 100,000 ounces of Carlin's production. So it's -- there are a number of other things we can do to source ore for the processing plants at Carlin whilst we work through how to best remediate that section of the Gold Quarry pit."

291795,582196412,1579188,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently;",1310,"Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently; sustaining a global portfolio of long-life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on 4 continents; and leading in profitability and responsibility. 
Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost 2 decades and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team. More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over 5 years ago, which is reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with a focus on capital discipline and industry-leading returns. 
Turning back to the third quarter details on Slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program in advancing our 3 most promising digital initiatives, including Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the third quarter, in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrate project. In South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September and mining continues on schedule. In Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study. And in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold and Orosur Mining projects in Colombia. We remain excited about Colombia's perspective gold districts and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project, which does not currently meet our expectations. 
The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment-grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we are recognized as the mining sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. While the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up and there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible, felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verifications to critical controls with the completion rate of 99% year-to-date. 
So previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again, highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources, like water; demonstrating best practices in corporate governance, codes of business conduct and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But as expected, our costs rise in 2018 as we execute planned stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Year-to-date, costs have decreased to $973 per ounce, which is consistent with our second half weighting. And we lowered and narrowed our 2018 AISC outlook to $950 to $990 per ounce, driven by continued outperformance at Boddington, Akyem and other sites across our portfolio, partially offset by higher costs at Carlin. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter as we reached higher grades in Africa and South America and increased processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada. And earlier this month, we poured our millions ounce of gold at Merian after just 2 years of operation. Due to recent geotechnical events at Carlin, we narrowed our full year production guidance to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million attributable ounces. Tom will cover this update in more detail later. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our highest production in the fourth quarter on the back of planned higher grades at Leeville, Yanacocha and Ahafo. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 8. In the third quarter, we delivered 2 profitable projects in North America with Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus. Both of these projects extend mine life and add lower cost production. And we are currently executing 4 projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In Africa, we remain on track at Subika Underground, which will add higher grade, lower cost production. And work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion has ramped up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're extending oxide production with Quecher Main, and we placed first ore in September. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. And finally, in Australia, we're making good progress on the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our ability to pursue growth on 4 continents is a distinct competitive advantage. In North America, we continue to pursue underground expansions at Carlin and are progressing pre-feasibility studies for Long Canyon Phase 2. And we've begun scoping the Galore Creek pre-feasibility studies with Teck Resources. Finally, we recently partnered with Evrim Resources to advance the exploration of Cuale, a perspective gold project in Mexico. 
In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And as I previously mentioned, we are working with Continental Gold to support development of the Buriticá project. We're also pursuing a range of other promising exploration prospects in Colombia, Chile, Suriname and French Guiana, where we've recently began drilling at the Esperance site shown in this picture. 
In Africa, we're advancing studies of underground deposits at Ahafo and Akyem and continue to progress the Ahafo North project, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. 
Finally, in Australia, we've advanced our second expansion at Tanami, which Tom will touch on further, and continue to explore greenfield targets across the continent. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 10 to discuss our third quarter financial results."

I'm pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income of $175 million or $0.33 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. Cash from continuing operations was $428 million compared to $489 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower metal prices and unfavorable changes in working capital. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. For the third quarter, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.31 per diluted share, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets at exploration properties in Emigrant in North America. As shown on the slide, these impairments were adjusted for a total of $0.74 per diluted share. Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.14 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.04 related to a change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities and gains on asset and investment sales. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. 
Turning to capital priorities on Slide 13. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. And we remain well positioned to execute on our capital priorities, including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Yesterday, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are on track to return nearly $400 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends in our share buyback program, which aims to maintain a constant share count. 
We also continue to support increased financial transparency in the gold sector. Over the last several months, we've led a working group with the World Gold Council and our peers to provide greater clarity and consistency for all-in sustaining cost reporting. The Council expects to issue an updated AISC guidance note next month with the January 1, 2019, effective date. For Newmont, the proposed changes are expected to lower our AISC due to the exclusion and reclassification of nonsustaining costs related to activities, such as exploration, advanced projects and R&D. Historically, we've taken a more conservative approach when reporting AISC, and we believe the changes will make our cost basis more comparable to our gold industry peers. We will provide additional details on these changes and reconcile to our past methodology when we issue our 2019 guidance on December 5. 
And now I'll hand it to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 14."
291795,582196412,1579188,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 15.

Year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance as production increased following the planned Mill 6 shut -- maintenance shut in Q2, and we started to see higher grades as expected from our underground mines. At our service mines, we continued to actively monitor and manage geotechnical risks. At Silverstar, our work continues to remediate the 2016 slip, and we still plan to access higher grade ore in the fourth quarter. However, after experiencing further wall movement during the third quarter, we have stepped out to manage this issue. As a consequence, we are targeting a smaller mining footprint in this pit. In early October, we also experienced a wall slip at our Gold Quarry pit. The detection measures we put in place identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining in this pit is currently suspended, and our teams are working through an assessment of mine plans and next steps to safely restart mining. As a result of these challenges, we lowered Carlin's 2019 production outlook. We now expect the North America region to produce approximately 1.9 million to 2.1 million ounces. 
As Gary mentioned, at CC&V, we completed the concentrate project. The cleaner flotation circuit is performing to design, and we are ramping up concentrate deliveries to Nevada. We expect a strong finish to the year as we continue to draw down stockpiled concentrates and process them through Carlin's Mill 6. 
Twin Creeks delivered improved costs and grade, following the completion of Twin Underground in July. And at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue to advance, as to our new mine exploration programs assessing the next wave of expansion across the region. 
Turning to South America on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, earlier this month, after just 2 years in operation, Merian poured its 1 millionth ounce. I'm tremendously proud of the team for safely achieving this milestone. In the third quarter, Merian delivered solid results through continued mine and mill productivity improvements. We declared the primary crusher ready for intended use in early September. This new crusher will help sustain mill throughput and enable the processing of fresh rock beginning early next year. We also expect productivity at Merian to increase over time with the recent addition of 4 new whole trucks combined with the ongoing improvements ramp full potential program. 
At Yanacocha, we reached higher grade ore in El Tapado estate pit and continue to see the benefits from our optimized mill blending strategy. Quecher Main stripping is ramping up, and we placed first ore on an existing leach pad in September as construction of the new leach pad continues. Studies at Chaquicocha Oxides continue to advance with drift development to the north and south completed, serving as a platform for the exploration drilling we have underway. The Yanacocha Sulfides, we plan to extend our feasibility study work by a few months to allow us to optimize our Carlin storage strategy and complete the associated engineering. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of 2019 and make a full funds decision in 2020. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 17. At Tanami, we delivered strong third quarter performance with higher grades and sustained improvements in mill throughput. The Tanami Power project continues on course. Construction activities at the power stations are ongoing, and the gas pipeline trenching and welding is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to deliver this project in the first quarter of 2019. At Boddington, our optimized mill maintenance strategy has helped improve productivity and costs, and we now expect a lower 2019 all-in sustaining cost of between $880 and $930 per ounce. Our planned stripping campaign will ramp up through the remainder of this year and continue through 2019. At KCGM, we continue to manage the impact from wall slips early this year. Mining rates have been reduced, however, we continue to mine and process ore from the Super Pit and Mt. Charlotte underground, supplemented with stockpiled ore. 
During the quarter, we finalized the insurance claim of $25 million for our share of lost profits. Considerable work is also underway to assess the longer-term impacts, and we expect to provide more information in early December. 
Looking to the future, we recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study and anticipate reaching an investment decision in the second half of 2019, followed by a 3-year construction period. For an investment of approximately $650 million to $750 million, this project is expected to add an incremental 100,000 ounces of annual production from 2023 through 2027. The project is not included in our current guidance. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 18. Africa again delivered solid results on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance. At Akyem, continued outperformance allowed us to lower our 2018 all-in sustaining costs for the Africa region to $820 to $860 per ounce. Looking ahead at Ahafo, commissioning is underway on the Subika Underground surface infrastructure, and the project continues to progress on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. The project is expected to add 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of higher grade, lower cost production annually over the next 5 years. Construction activities at the Ahafo Mill Expansion resumed in August, and the team is making good progress on civil works at both the Sag Mill and primary crusher. During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the installation of the new pebble crusher and CIL tanks. We remain on track to achieve commercial production during the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies focused on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. 
Now I'll hand it back to Gary on Slide 19."

Newmont is anchored in 4 regions where we have the stability and operating model that we need to create value over the long term. We began transforming our business 6 years ago, and I remain very proud of the team for the work done to set our business up for success over the long term by optimizing the portfolio through the monetization of noncore assets; advancing profitable growth on all continents, adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of about $750 per ounce; investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia; and restoring our balance sheet to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our most promising projects and prospects. All of these attributes give us the optionality and the ability to stay disciplined in how we pursue value creation and generate returns for shareholders. 
Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to Slide 21. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia and Quecher Main in Peru. Two mid-term projects that will improve our outlook are Ahafo North and the recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2, both shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund these projects in the second half of 2019. 
Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to Slide 22. This gives you a feel for our production profile for the next 7 years. Annual gold production is forecast to remain at around 5 million attributable ounces, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over that same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, both mid-term projects, which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the Yanacocha Sulfides, a longer-term feasibility project representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. 
Putting it all together on Slide 23. We delivered strong third quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We'll continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

So you're going to see the contribution of some higher grade ore from Subika open pit coming in our fourth quarter numbers. And what happens with Subika Underground? We have been mining from there all year. But as we commissioned the fans, the ventilation fans and the refrigeration plant, it allows more air in the underground mine and allows us to increase our mining rate. So you'll see some more tons coming out of the mine and the better grades you get from Subika. So in the fourth quarter for Ahafo, combination of 2 things, both service and underground, both associated with Subika, they're going to contribute to fourth quarter performance."

So Silverstar is in the north part of Carlin and Gold Quarry is in the south part, so they are good 20 miles apart across that Carlin complex. In Silverstar, the work we've done through the third quarter to step out and manage some of the activity we saw through the third quarter, that's all in good shape. We're in ore, and we'll be mining there from now until the end of the first quarter. And that really sees the end of the Silverstar pit, and there's the order of about 160,000 ounces to come out of here. So that's factored into our guidance, the remaining part of this year. Gold Quarry, the area that slipped, it says -- as I think John said, it is a mature pit, and the area that slipped was some alluvial material at the very top of that pit, so a wall that had been sitting for quite some time. So we've got some work to do to step through and understand the mechanisms for what happened there and then develop a remediation plan to get back in and accessing ore out of Gold Quarry. A lot of the work in Gold Quarry for the short to medium term is actually stripping. And Gold Quarry is one of -- for the Carlin complex, Gold Quarry is one of 5 open pits that we're mining, multiple underground mines and then multiple stockpile sources. So the overall impact to Gold Quarry, put it in perspective, year-to-date, Gold Quarry has contributed about 100,000 ounces of Carlin's production. So it's -- there are a number of other things we can do to source ore for the processing plants at Carlin whilst we work through how to best remediate that section of the Gold Quarry pit."
