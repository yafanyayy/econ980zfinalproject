I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call, and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals, and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we got a much clearer path to value and I am very optimistic about the potential for offsetting our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets. 
Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization with the first $500 million program to begin immediately. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. As you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million. The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jumpstart of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017. Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day. 
Now moving to our portfolio optimization. Today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM, for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year, and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress. 
Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3x by the end of the year. With the asset -- the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. 
I am pleased to announced that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program with the $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress toward the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program. 
Moving to Slide 6 with our business and financial highlights. It was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top decile safety performance, but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament for the culture and focus of our employees, and I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for the hard work and for keeping safety our top priority. 
Now with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year. 
Now in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in the reorganization plan that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a standalone entity and provide NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period. 
On Slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past 2 years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our integrated power business. First, we are reducing our capacity by over 1/2 to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. 
As we are scaling back our Generation, our Retail business continues to be strong with a steady increase in customer account and continued solid earnings. And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile given the better balance between Generation and Retail. It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. 
NRG has always been a cash flow machine and with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018. Our ratio unmatched in our industry. And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better position to create shareholder value, both today and into the future. 
Now the markets continue to show signs of steady improvement as highlighted on Slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and the slowdowns in new builds given chronic low prices. Now and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening, and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%. 
In our power prices in the forward markets where ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have more dramatically the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past 6 years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plans are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills. 
Now, in competitive markets more broadly, there had been a persistent call to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum towards these objectives and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets. 
Now turning to Slide 9, I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO 2 years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore, focused on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt. 
Since 2016, we had paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt and with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA of 3x by the end of the year. 
As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization. 
So with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,551170081,1406978,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. For t",2080,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution and cost reductions and continued cost of growth. Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including the onetime impact of noncash expense for approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million in line with expectations. 
Including today's announced sale of our Boston NRG Trading Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced close to date totals $3 billion or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019. In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by 5 years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt due to the redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes. These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million. 
I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement, which is not included in our EBITDA results. Now it's a noncash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This chart primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project or STP, our nuclear facility, south of Houston. On a regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices, and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million that was largely related to the announced sale of BETM. 
Turning to 2018 guidance, we are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements are also unchanged from our call last month. Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate a significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses as we convert over $0.60 of every dollar to EBITDA -- of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results. 
Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020. 
Turning now to Slide 12. We provided financial summary of our 2017 NRG level capital allocation with changes since our third quarter update, highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018. 
First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which formed the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar drop-downs to NRG Yield. On the uses said, actual allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court proved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocation to GenOn consist of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly. 
Next, NRG's actual cost to achieve associated to the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates and actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments. The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end shown on the right side of the slide, forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on Slide 13. 
Our expected capital from existing sources on the left of the chart on Page 13 includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales net of transaction cost, leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion. 
Turning to uses of capital. We have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet and this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA. I'll review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section. But we expect the [ $760 million ] in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond. However, given part to the fact that I just mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realized $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve will be released and available for future allocation. 
Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which, we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholders are unchanged versus the 2017 rate. 
Turning to GenOn, we expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn expected to emerge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment and cost to achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018, I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consists primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the drop-down proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left. And Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on these current allocations, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018. 
Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide, we start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses of 2019 and 2020, to update our revised expected cumulative excess capital. 
First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, adds $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan, which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate and the $20 million increase in run rate maintenance CapEx. 
Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million and additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects 2 years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year-end 2018. 
Turning to uses. $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest gen capacity monetization shown as debt for accounting purposes as well as ongoing, but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents 2 years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan and finally, $75 million to fund 2 years of annual dividend at the current rate, which of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback. We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve, I spoke about earlier to arrive in an applied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which for comparative purposes is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization. 
And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on Slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yields and Renewables business as well as the associated drop-downs to NRG Yield. What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion. $1.3 billion of which is nonrecourse debt. Approximately 90% is remaining balance of nonrecourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level, which amortizes, funded by project level cash flows over the remaining life of the. The balance of nonrecourse debt is what remains of the Midwest gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated debt for accounting purposes and is fully repaid by 2019. 
Turning the right side of the slide, our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and a permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation. For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve, I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assumed that $613 million and remaining excess capital in 2018 showing the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities. The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run rate impact of the Transformation Plan with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deducted EBITDA from nonrecourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back to cash distributions from those subsidiaries as well as consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain noncash expenses included in the EBITDA. Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve reflects a ratio of 3x our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks."

And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year. In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now, with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a standalone company by September of 2018. 
I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles. I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27.

So Stephen, let me answer the question in -- with I guess, 2 time frames. The first is 2018 because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer and perhaps, longer term, which is more of a structural change. So for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the appendix our hedge percentages, now on a pro forma basis and as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure so we are, from a generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening condition or the tightening conditions that exist in the market. Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back to back all our retail load, and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that, that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in valuable pricing. We take steps to manage that growth and as the load progresses and it fixes the price, we can, what I describe is detailed or perfect the hedges that we have on that pricing loan. Now longer term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty, pretty open as you can tell on the hedging disclosure that we have provided. So we will benefit from any structural changes and we believe that this repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020, which is not going to have a chance to have new builds in the span of 1.5 years or 2 years. Our Retail business on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number 2, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit the margin compression that you should expect or you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business and more than offset that. And then the final thing that I would say is volatility creates opportunities and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look -- want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that have generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So we see that also as an opportunity."

We laid out our priorities a couple of earnings calls ago and when I think about capital deployment and capital allocation, it's just using those principles that we have already articulated to you. We need to make sure that our business is performing operating in financial level that we want. Now that we have line of sight after the asset sales on our credit metrics, then it gives us the opportunity to start thinking about growth or returning capital to shareholders. And in the returning capital to shareholders bucket, we have share buybacks or dividends. And right now, just given where the stock is, we have opted to execute on our -- on share repurchases, but dividends are very, very viable way to returning capital to shareholders. We're going to continue evaluating that throughout the year. And once we finish with our initiatives and complete the repositioning of our portfolio, then we will have our robust conversation internally and with our Board of Directors to see what is the best way to return capital to shareholders, but hopefully, the announcements that we're making today demonstrate that are clear examples of our commitment to be very disciplined when it comes to capital allocation."

So if I'm comparing apples-to-apples to somebody else, is it a 2x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but they're converting $0.35 on every dollar where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking and while EBITDA is a nice statistic, cash rules the day in terms of financial flexibility and that, I think, is the distinction worth repeating."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals, and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we have a much clearer path to value, and I am very optimistic about the potential for upside in our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets. 
Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization, with the first $500 million program to begin immediately. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. As you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA-accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million. The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jump-start of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017. Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run-rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day. 
Now moving to our portfolio optimization. Today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year, and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress. 
Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3x by the end of the year. With the asset -- the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. 
I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. I am pleased to announce that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program, with a $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress toward the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program. 
Moving to Slide 6 with our business and financial highlights. It was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top-decile safety performance but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament to the culture and focus of our employees, and I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their hard work and for keeping safety our top priority. 
Now with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year. 
Now in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in a reorganization plan that was approved by the bankruptcy court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a stand-alone entity and provides NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period. 
On Slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past 2 years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our vertically integrated power business. First, we are reducing our capacity by over 1/2 to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. 
As we are scaling back our Generation, our Retail business continues to be strong with a steady increase in customer account and continued solid earnings. And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile given the better balance between Generation and Retail. 
It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. NRG has always been a cash flow machine, and with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018, a ratio unmatched in our industry. And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better positioned to create shareholder value, both today and into the future. 
Now the markets continue to show signs of steady improvement, as highlighted on Slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and slowdowns in new builds given chronic low prices. Now and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening, and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%. 
Power prices in the forward markets for ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have moved dramatically in the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer, as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past 6 years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plants are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills. 
Now in competitive markets, more broadly, there had been a persistent call to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum toward these objectives, and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO 2 years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore focused on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt. 
Since 2016, we have paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt, and with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA of 3x by the end of the year. 
As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value-maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization. 
So with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. Fo",2081,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. 
For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution on cost reductions and continued cost for growth. Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including the onetime impact of noncash expense for approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million, in line with expectations. Including today's announced sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced or closed to date totals $3 billion or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019. 
In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by 5 years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt and redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes. These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and, combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing, led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million.  
I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement which is not included in our EBITDA results. That is a noncash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This charge primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project or STP, our nuclear facility south of Houston. Our regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million and was largely related to the announced sale of BETM. 
Turning to 2018 guidance. We are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint of guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements, are also unchanged from our call last month. Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate the significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses as we convert over $0.60 of every dollar to EBITDA -- of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results.  Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020. 
Turning now to Slide 12. We provide a financial summary of our 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, with changes since our third quarter update highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018. 
First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million, as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG-level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which formed the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar drop-downs to NRG Yield. 
On the uses side, actual capital allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court-approved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocated to GenOn consist of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence; and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly. 
Next, NRG's actual cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates in actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments. The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end, shown on the right side of the slide, forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on Slide 13. 
Our expected capital from existing sources, on the left of the chart on Page 13, includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales, net of transaction costs, leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion. 
Turning to uses of capital. We have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet, and this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA. I'll  review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section, but we expect this $760 million in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond. 
However, given part of the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realize $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve would be released and available for future allocation. 
Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholders, are unchanged versus the 2017 rate. 
Turning to GenOn. We expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn is expected to emerge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect 20 -- $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment and cost to achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018 I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consists primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the drop-down proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left; and Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on these current allocations, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018. 
Please turn to Slide 14, and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll-forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide. We start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses in 2019 and 2020 to update our revised expected cumulative excess capital. 
First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, we add $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate and the $20 million increase in run-rate maintenance CapEx. 
Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million in additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects 2 years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year-end 2018. 
Turning to uses. $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest Gen capacity monetization, shown as debt for accounting purposes, as well as ongoing but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents 2 years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan; and finally, $75 million to fund 2 years of annual dividend at the current rate, which, of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback. We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to arrive in implied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which, for comparative purposes, is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization. 
And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on Slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables business as well as the associated drop-downs to NRG Yield. What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion, $1.3 billion of which is nonrecourse debt. Approximately 90% of this remaining balance of nonrecourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level, which amortizes, funded by project-level cash flows, over the remaining life of the PPA. The balance of nonrecourse debt is what remains of the Midwest Gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated as debt for accounting purposes and is fully repaid by 2019. 
Turning to the right side of the slide. Our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and the permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation. For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assume that $613 million in remaining excess capital in 2018, shown in the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities. 
The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run-rate impact of the Transformation Plan, with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deduct the EBITDA from nonrecourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back to cash distributions from those subsidiaries as well as, consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain noncash expenses included in EBITDA. Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve reflects a ratio of 3x our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks."

And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year. 
In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a stand-alone company by September of 2018. 
I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles. I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27.

So Stephen, let me answer the question in -- with, I guess, 2 time frames. The first is 2018 because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer; and then perhaps longer term, which is more of a structural change. So for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the appendix our hedge percentages now on a pro forma basis, and as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure. So we are -- from a generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening condition -- or the tightening conditions that exist in the market. Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back to back all our retail load, and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that, that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in variable pricing. We take steps to manage that load. And as the load progresses and it fixes the price, we can -- what I describe is detail or perfect the hedges that we have on that variable pricing load. Now longer term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty open, as you can tell on the hedging disclosure that we have provided, so we will benefit from any structural changes. And we believe that this repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020 since we're just not going to have a chance to have new builds in the span of 1.5 years or 2 years. Our Retail business, on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number two, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit the margin compression that you should expect from -- or that you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business and more than offset that. And then the final thing that I will say is volatility creates opportunities, and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex, and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look -- want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that have generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So we see that also as an opportunity."

What I will say is, just given where the market conditions are, those attractive opportunities are perhaps more likely in the Retail business than in the Generation business, and that's where we're going to be focusing. I mean, keep in mind that in the East, we're still long generation. We need to continue growing our Retail business both organically and perhaps if there is an attractive opportunity in the retail sector, we will evaluate that.

And in the returning capital to shareholders bucket, I mean, we have the share buybacks or  dividend. And right now, just given where the stock is, we have opted to execute on our -- on share repurchases. But dividends are a very viable way to returning capital to shareholders. We're going to continue evaluating that throughout the year. And once we finish with our initiatives and complete the repositioning of our portfolio, then we will have a robust conversation internally and with our Board of Directors to see what is the best way to return capital to shareholders.

So what is optimal? Is 3 turns still optimal? Or has -- your thought process, had it evolved?"

And both Mauricio and I, again, reiterated our -- how pleased we are with what the knock-on effect of what we're doing in the Transformation Plan means and our ability to more efficiently translate EBITDA to free cash flow. And legging towards 2/3 or $0.67 of every dollar translating, that makes a big difference. So if I'm comparing apples to apples to somebody else who's at a 2x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio but they're converting $0.35 on every dollar where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking. And while EBITDA is a nice statistic, cash rules the day in terms of financial flexibility, and that, I think, as a distinction is worth repeating."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business",1577,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals, and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we have a much clearer path to value, and I am very optimistic about the potential for upside in our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets. 
Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization, with the first $500 million program to begin immediately. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. As you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA-accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million. The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jump-start of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017. Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run-rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day. 
Now moving to our portfolio optimization. Today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, or BETM, for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year, and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress. 
Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3x by the end of the year. With the asset -- the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. 
I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. I am pleased to announce that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program, with a $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress toward the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program. 
Moving to Slide 6 with our business and financial highlights. It was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top-decile safety performance, but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament to the culture and focus of our employees, and I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their hard work and for keeping safety our top priority. 
Now with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year. 
Now in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in a reorganization plan that was approved by the bankruptcy court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a stand-alone entity and provides NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period. 
On Slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past 2 years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our vertically integrated power business. First, we are reducing our capacity by over 1/2 to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. 
As we are scaling back our Generation, our Retail business continues to be strong, with a steady stream increase in customer account and continued solid earnings. And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile, given the better balance between Generation and Retail. 
It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. NRG has always been a cash flow machine, and with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018, a ratio unmatched in our industry. And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better positioned to create shareholder value, both today and into the future. 
Now the markets continue to show signs of steady improvement, as highlighted on Slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and slowdowns in new builds given chronic low prices. Now and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening, and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%. 
Power prices in the forward markets for ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have moved dramatically in the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer, as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past 6 years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plants are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills. 
Now in competitive markets, more broadly, there had been a persistent call to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum toward these objectives, and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO 2 years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore focused on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt. 
Since 2016, we have paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt, and with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA of 3x by the end of the year. 
As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value-maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization. 
So with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,551170081,1409418,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. Fo",2081,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. 
For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution on cost reductions and continued customer growth. Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including the onetime impact of noncash expense for approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million, in line with expectations. Including today's announced sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced or closed to date totals $3 billion or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019. 
In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by 5 years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt through the redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes. These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and, combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing, led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million.  
I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement, which is not included in our EBITDA results. That is a noncash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This charge primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project or STP, our nuclear facility south of Houston. Our regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million and was largely related to the announced sale of BETM. 
Turning to 2018 guidance. We are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint of guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements, are also unchanged from our call last month. Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate the significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses as we convert over $0.60 of every dollar to EBITDA -- of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results.  Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020. 
Turning now to Slide 12. We provide a financial summary of our 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, with changes since our third quarter update highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018. 
First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million, as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG-level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which formed the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar drop-downs to NRG Yield. 
On the uses side, actual capital allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court-approved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocated to GenOn consist of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence; and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly. 
Next, NRG's actual cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates in actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments. The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end, shown on the right side of the slide, forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on Slide 13. 
Our expected capital from existing sources, on the left of the chart on Page 13, includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance, plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales, net of transaction costs, leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion. 
Turning to uses of capital. We have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet, and this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA. I'll review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section, but we expect this $760 million in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond. 
However, given part of the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realize $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve would be released and available for future allocation. 
Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholders, are unchanged versus the 2017 rate. 
Turning to GenOn. We expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn is expected to emerge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect 20 -- $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment and cost to achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018 I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consists primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the drop-down proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left; and Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on these current allocations, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018. 
Please turn to Slide 14, and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll-forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide, we start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses in 2019 and 2020 to update our revised expected cumulative excess capital. 
First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, adds $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate and the $20 million increase in run-rate maintenance CapEx. 
Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million in additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects 2 years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year-end 2018. 
Turning to uses. $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest Gen capacity monetization, shown as debt for accounting purposes, as well as ongoing but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents 2 years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan; and finally, $75 million to fund 2 years of annual dividend at the current rate, which, of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback. We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to arrive at an implied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which, for comparative purposes, is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization. 
And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on Slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables business as well as the associated drop-downs to NRG Yield. What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion, $1.3 billion of which is nonrecourse debt. Approximately 90% of this remaining balance of nonrecourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level, which amortizes, funded by project-level cash flows, over the remaining life of the PPA. The balance of nonrecourse debt is what remains of the Midwest Gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated as debt for accounting purposes and is fully repaid by 2019. 
Turning to the right side of the slide. Our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and the permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation. For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assume that $613 million in remaining excess capital in 2018, shown in the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities. 
The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run-rate impact of the Transformation Plan, with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deduct the EBITDA from nonrecourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back the cash distributions from those subsidiaries as well as, consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain noncash expenses included in EBITDA. Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion, temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve, reflects a ratio of 3x our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks."

And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year. 
In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a stand-alone company by September of 2018. 
I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles. I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27. 
I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, Sonya, we are now ready to open the lines for questions."

So Stephen, let me answer the question in -- with, I guess, 2 time frames. The first is 2018 because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer; and then perhaps longer term, which is more of a structural change. So for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the appendix our hedge percentages now on a pro forma basis, and as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure. So we are -- from a generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening condition -- or the tightening conditions that exist in the market. Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back to back all our retail load, and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that, that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in variable pricing. We take steps to manage that load. And as the load progresses and it fixes the price, we can -- what I describe is detail or perfect the hedges that we have on that variable pricing load. Now longer term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty open, as you can tell on the hedging disclosure that we have provided, so we will benefit from any structural changes. And we believe that this repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020 since we're just not going to have a chance to have new builds in the span of 1.5 years or 2 years. Our Retail business, on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number two, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit the margin compression that you should expect from -- or that you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business and more than offset that. And then the final thing that I will say is volatility creates opportunities, and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex, and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look -- want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that have generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So we see that also as an opportunity."

I mean, keep in mind that in the East, we're still long generation. We need to continue growing our Retail business both organically and perhaps if there is an attractive opportunity in the retail sector, we will evaluate that.

Now that we have line of sight after the asset sales on our credit metrics, then it gives us the opportunity to start thinking about growth or returning capital to shareholders. And in the returning capital to shareholders bucket, I mean, we have the share buybacks or a dividend. And right now, just given where the stock is, we have opted to execute on our -- on share repurchases. But dividends are a very viable way to returning capital to shareholders. We're going to continue evaluating that throughout the year. And once we finish with our initiatives and complete the repositioning of our portfolio, then we will have a robust conversation internally and with our Board of Directors to see what is the best way to return capital to shareholders.

And that's -- keep in mind, that's an area where Retail retains a lot of pricing flexibility given that if they're not -- if they haven't sold anything out of there yet. So I feel like we're in pretty good shape right now."

That's not to say -- we continue to look towards that. I mean, as I think I may even have said in a prior call, maybe the last call we had, we don't look at our credit ratio objectives as a ""set it and forget it.""

So that's in constant review, but I think suffice to say, we're -- that's not a primary focus. We're comfortable with our BB target."

And both Mauricio and I, again, reiterated our -- how pleased we are with what the knock-on effect of what we're doing in the Transformation Plan means and our ability to more efficiently translate EBITDA to free cash flow. And legging towards 2/3 or $0.67 of every dollar translating, that makes a big difference. So if I'm comparing apples to apples to somebody else who's at a 2x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio but they're converting $0.35 on every dollar where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking. And while EBITDA is a nice statistic, cash rules the day in terms of financial flexibility, and that, I think, is a distinction that's worth repeating."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals, and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we have a much clearer path to value, and I am very optimistic about the potential for upside in our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets. 
Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization, with the first $500 million program to begin immediately. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. As you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA-accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million. The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jump-start of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017. Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run-rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day. 
Now moving to our portfolio optimization. Today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, or BETM, for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year, and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress. 
Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3x by the end of the year. With the asset -- the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. 
I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. I am pleased to announce that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program, with a $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress toward the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program. 
Moving to Slide 6 with our business and financial highlights. It was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top-decile safety performance, but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament to the culture and focus of our employees, and I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their hard work and for keeping safety our top priority. 
Now with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year. 
Now in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in a reorganization plan that was approved by the bankruptcy court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a stand-alone entity and provides NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period. 
On Slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past 2 years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our vertically integrated power business. First, we are reducing our capacity by over 1/2 to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. 
As we are scaling back our Generation, our Retail business continues to be strong, with a steady stream increase in customer account and continued solid earnings. And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile, given the better balance between Generation and Retail. 
It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. NRG has always been a cash flow machine, and with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018, a ratio unmatched in our industry. And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better positioned to create shareholder value, both today and into the future. 
Now the markets continue to show signs of steady improvement, as highlighted on Slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and slowdowns in new builds given chronic low prices. Now and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening, and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%. 
Power prices in the forward markets for ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have moved dramatically in the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer, as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past 6 years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plants are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills. 
Now in competitive markets, more broadly, there had been a persistent call to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum toward these objectives, and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO 2 years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore focused on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt. 
Since 2016, we have paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt, and with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net-debt-to-EBITDA of 3x by the end of the year. 
As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value-maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization. 
So with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. Fo",2081,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. In 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. 
For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution on cost reductions and continued customer growth. Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including the onetime impact of noncash expense for approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million, in line with expectations. Including today's announced sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced or closed to date totals $3 billion or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019. 
In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by 5 years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt through the redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes. These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and, combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing, led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million.  
I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement, which is not included in our EBITDA results. That is a noncash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This charge primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project or STP, our nuclear facility south of Houston. Our regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million and was largely related to the announced sale of BETM. 
Turning to 2018 guidance. We are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint of guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements, are also unchanged from our call last month. Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate the significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses as we convert over $0.60 of every dollar to EBITDA -- of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results.  Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020. 
Turning now to Slide 12. We provide a financial summary of our 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, with changes since our third quarter update highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018. 
First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million, as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG-level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which formed the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar drop-downs to NRG Yield. 
On the uses side, actual capital allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court-approved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocated to GenOn consist of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence; and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly. 
Next, NRG's actual cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates in actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments. The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end, shown on the right side of the slide, forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on Slide 13. 
Our expected capital from existing sources, on the left of the chart on Page 13, includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance, plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales, net of transaction costs, leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion. 
Turning to uses of capital. We have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet, and this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA. I'll review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section, but we expect this $760 million in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond. 
However, given part of the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realize $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve would be released and available for future allocation. 
Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholders, are unchanged versus the 2017 rate. 
Turning to GenOn. We expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn is expected to emerge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect 20 -- $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment and cost to achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018 I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consists primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the drop-down proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left; and Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on these current allocations, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018. 
Please turn to Slide 14, and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll-forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide, we start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses in 2019 and 2020 to update our revised expected cumulative excess capital. 
First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, adds $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate and the $20 million increase in run-rate maintenance CapEx. 
Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million in additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects 2 years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year-end 2018. 
Turning to uses. $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest Gen capacity monetization, shown as debt for accounting purposes, as well as ongoing but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents 2 years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan; and finally, $75 million to fund 2 years of annual dividend at the current rate, which, of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback. We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to arrive at an implied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which, for comparative purposes, is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization. 
And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on Slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables business as well as the associated drop-downs to NRG Yield. What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion, $1.3 billion of which is nonrecourse debt. Approximately 90% of this remaining balance of nonrecourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level, which amortizes, funded by project-level cash flows, over the remaining life of the PPA. The balance of nonrecourse debt is what remains of the Midwest Gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated as debt for accounting purposes and is fully repaid by 2019. 
Turning to the right side of the slide. Our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and the permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation. For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assume that $613 million in remaining excess capital in 2018, shown in the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities. 
The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run-rate impact of the Transformation Plan, with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deduct the EBITDA from nonrecourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back the cash distributions from those subsidiaries as well as, consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain noncash expenses included in EBITDA. Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion, temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve, reflects a ratio of 3x our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks."

And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year. 
In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a stand-alone company by September of 2018. 
I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles. I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27. 
I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, Sonya, we are now ready to open the lines for questions."

So Stephen, let me answer the question in -- with, I guess, 2 time frames. The first is 2018 because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer; and then perhaps longer term, which is more of a structural change. So for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the appendix our hedge percentages now on a pro forma basis, and as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure. So we are -- from a generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening condition -- or the tightening conditions that exist in the market. Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back to back all our retail load, and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that, that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in variable pricing. We take steps to manage that load. And as the load progresses and it fixes the price, we can -- what I describe in detail or perfect the hedges that we have on that variable pricing load. Now longer term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty open, as you can tell on the hedging disclosure that we have provided, so we will benefit from any structural changes. And we believe that this repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020 since we're just not going to have a chance to have new builds in the span of 1.5 years or 2 years. Our Retail business, on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number two, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit the margin compression that you should expect from -- or that you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business and more than offset that. And then the final thing that I will say is volatility creates opportunities, and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex, and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look -- want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that have generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So we see that also as an opportunity."

We need to continue growing our Retail business both organically and perhaps if there is an attractive opportunity in the retail sector, we will evaluate that.

It's always been, in hindsight, over the years, a mistake to get too excited too early in the year in terms of guidance ranges and changing them, but forward curves and power market dynamics have improved quite significantly since you gave the guidance range. So are you -- can you give us any sense of, given how you've hedged the portfolio, whether forward curves were to hold up at these levels for the remainder of the year, where would you sort of be within the guidance range?

If it is extreme load and extreme price, that's going to limit the upside as the unit's length ends up covering and protecting retail margins. So -- but in extreme-load, extreme-price situation in '18, that should have some carryforward and bleed through into '19 and beyond, which should give us some pretty good hedging opportunities in the forwards. And that's -- keep in mind, that's an area where Retail retains a lot of pricing flexibility given that if they're not -- if they haven't sold anything out of there yet.

And both Mauricio and I, again, reiterated our -- how pleased we are with what the knock-on effect of what we're doing in the Transformation Plan means and our ability to more efficiently translate EBITDA to free cash flow. And legging towards 2/3 or $0.67 of every dollar translating, that makes a big difference. So if I'm comparing apples to apples to somebody else who's at a 2x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio but they're converting $0.35 on every dollar where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking.

Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and  am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders.
So now turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well-positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan, and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years.
Moving to Slide 4, let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast. Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $250 million in margin enhancements. Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018.
Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day. Starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on the Slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve these by being well positioned in attractive markets, and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven. This is not just an attractive, but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to Retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strength to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands.
Our evolution has led us to right size our Generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic Generation and Retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity and while today it is not economical current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our Retail business during periods of high prices.
Now by becoming better balance, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable Retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA, and a Generation business that is well positioned for our market to recover.
Moreover, the low capital intensity of our Retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet, enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform, stability and off-site. As you can see, our Retail earnings are fairly stable, whether prices go up or down, especially when you are up. Our Generation business is more directly correlated to power prices, and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to zero, because our Generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments. So when you combine these 2 businesses, you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced.
Now turning to Slide 6, with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program. We remain on track to achieve our target. And 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and '20. The line share of our targets comes from our Retail Mass business through 2 types of initiatives, value expansion and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're in investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business. On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which first and foremost supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After these, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022.
The result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts and some modest growth in our Retail business. As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles. Because we are on track to achieve 3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year, we have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at or above our target total rate and returning capital to our shareholders.
These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback. 
So before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022.
Now if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibilities, and we are fully committed to being excellence towards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan.
Now moving to our markets, starting with ERCOT on the Slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in new build given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve markets. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly, with summer on peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour. 
Moving to the right side of the slide. Our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected Generation hedge. On the Retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced low for the balance of 2018. For the summer, specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well positioned for prices. So first let's talk about our Generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked Harley spring season to ensure our can withstand increased times given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased average insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages.
Second, our Retail business and as a matter of policy is fully hedged against our priced Retail load. This is made all up of not only internal hedges where we crossed Generation in Retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high loads and high-priced conditions. Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills.
I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from outside this summer should prices materialize. 
So now turning to the east on the Slide 8. The PJM capacity for planning year '21, '22 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations.
Last auction saw a slowed in new builds, and over 7 announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how this will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable. While some entities are grasping at bailouts in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market. And we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market value proposition. Without PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low buckets. We remain optimistic about the continued cost to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well-functioning of competitive markets.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,559439264,1446854,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 03, 2018",2018-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Now turning to financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $172",690,"Thank you, Mauricio. Now turning to financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and yield contributed $188 million and $189 million, respectively. Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and Retail load in Texas. Those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we are only have few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. During the first quarter, NRG successfully repriced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to 175 over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million.
Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with the third-party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar's energy yield, closing the first of several Transformation Plan asset sales we had announced in early February.
And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our Board of Directors. Through the first quarter, we executed approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of 29.75. We continued to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We'll also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment for share repurchases once we've closed the more substantial portion of the asset sales we announced last February.
Turning to Slide 11. Our expected 2018 NRG level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available, taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds to net of previously announced commitments, including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted in Analyst Day, this amounts to $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update, as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM.
Finally, on Slide 12, taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018.
Turning to a pro forma 2020 review of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance, including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020.
The combination of both the $275 million and additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so. Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released with that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders.
In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash, including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.13 billion.
With that, I will turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

You also cautioned that your purchasing insurance and other things. Should we think about the sensitivity here for '18 is being fairly really linear or is there a sort of capping out colors and things like that? And maybe a second question at the same time, I'll throw it to you is. Can you talk about the in the curve of in '19 and '20, and just what you're seeing out there in terms of trends of new supply. Clearly in recent, we've seen some falling of assets and things like that, so curious for an update?"

Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month. Now, what we -- like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer along, I'm not going to we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. It's a matter of fact we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us, and we just continue to do that going forward. The second thing is, we provided also sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expect that prices will be. Obviously, we have to see how the summer plays out. Hopefully with these are two additional elements you can at least have an idea where -- where I would say on a mark-to-market we would look like. But obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas. Now to your second question about the on the curve, Chris?"

It's obviously with $150 for this summer and then $125-ish for '19.

It's obviously with $150 for this summer and then $125-ish for '19. Quite frankly, I still think '19 has room to come up and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in '19 still. When the final came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back. Barney Davis was one that was around 300 megawatts. Creek, I think, was always in the numbers or at least no surprise to the market. That one was expected to come back. So there was a little bit of move there for this summer. Interestingly, though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve market actually went down some. It was 11 -- 11.7, I think, in the last  Sarah and this CDR came out at about 11. What they did there was actually reduced lower by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced station by 1,000. So it's kind of going in the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets working, for instance, actually pushing back 3 years from '19 to 2022, I think, was the most recent number there
So wanted to see how that works. I mean, obviously part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that new build situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that is high enough or long in up to in center and we're hoping that the rational new build is a thing of the past."

It provides a right signal and incentive for developers and companies to start putting capital to work in that market. So you need to see 2 things. You need to see them high enough, and you need to see them long enough to attract this capital investment. Now, we are not seeing actually the contrary. We've been talking about the slow down on new generation is very real, and you can still see it in the latest CDR or Sarah report that Texas put out. And I think, Chris already mentioned, some of these units are being pushed out 1 or 2 years. With respect to other technologies, I don't see that really taking off with -- only with 1 year of high prices. I mean, they basically follow the same behavior as in combined cycle. I don't see Texas putting a program of out of market payments to see whether battery storage or other technologies like that. I mean, has been very clear and have been very clear in competitive markets and energy only market. And we just need to make sure that we just let it work."

Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and I am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders.
So now turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well-positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March, where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top-decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast. Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $215 million in margin enhancements. 
Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018. Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program.
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day. Starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on Slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve these by being well positioned in attractive markets and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven. This is not just an attractive, but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to Retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strengths to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands. Our evolution has led us to right size our Generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic Generation and Retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity and while today it is not economic at current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our Retail business during periods of high prices.
Now by becoming better balanced, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable Retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA and a Generation business that is well positioned for a market recovery. Moreover, the low capital intensity of our Retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet, enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. 
The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform, stability and off-site. As you can see, our Retail earnings are fairly stable, whether prices go up or down, especially 1-year out. Our Generation business is more directly correlated to power prices and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to 0, because our Generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments. So when you combine these 2 businesses, you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced.
Now turning to Slide 6, with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program. We remain on track to achieve our target, and 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and '20. The lion's share of our targets comes from our Retail Mass business through 2 types of initiatives: value expansion; and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business. 
On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which first and foremost, supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After these, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022, the result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts and some modest growth in our Retail business. As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles because we are on track to achieve 3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year. We have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at or above our target hurdle rate and returning capital to our shareholders. These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback. 
So before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022. Now if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellence towards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan.
Now moving to our markets and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in new build given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve margins. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly, with summer on-peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected Generation hedge. On the Retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced low for the balance of 2018. For this summer specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well positioned for high prices. 
So first let's talk about our Generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked hard this spring outage season to ensure our unit can withstand increased run times given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased outage insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages. Second, our Retail business, and as a matter of policy, is fully hedged against our priced Retail load. This is made all up of not only internal hedges where we cross Generation and Retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high-loads and high-priced conditions. Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills. I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from upside this summer, should prices materialize.
So now turning to the East on Slide 8. The PJM capacity Auction for planning year '21, '22 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations. Last auction saw a slow down in new builds, and over 7 gigawatts of announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how this will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable. While some entities are rasping at bailouts in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market, and we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market-value proposition. Beyond PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low pockets. We remain optimistic about the continued cost to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well functioning of competitive markets.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,559439264,1447251,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 03, 2018",2018-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $17",694,"Thank you, Mauricio. 
Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and yield contributed $188 million and $189 million, respectively. Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas, and those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we're still only a few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. 
During the first quarter, NRG successfully repriced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to 175 over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million. Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar's energy yield, closing the first of several transformation planned asset sales we had announced in early February. And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our Board of Directors. Through the first quarter, we executed approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of $29.75. We continue to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We'll also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment for share repurchases once we have closed a more substantial portion of the asset sales we had announced last February.
Turning to Slide 11. Our expected 2018 NRG level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds to net of previously announced commitments, including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted in Analyst Day, this amount is $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update, as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM.
Finally, on Slide 12. Taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018.
Turning to a pro forma 2020 view of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance and including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020. The combination of both the $275 million in additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so. Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released, with that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders. In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash, including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.13 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We also continued to move closer to the final resolution of GenOn, which is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. And finally, our Analyst Day provided a longer-term strategic discussion of our business. Our path forward will generate significant excess cash by leveraging our strengths, capitalizing on market trends and making execution of our Transformation Plan our #1 priority.

You also cautioned that your purchasing insurance and other things. Should we think about the sensitivity here for '18 is being fairly linear? Or is there a sort of a capping out with collars and things like that? And then maybe a second question at the same time, I'll throw it to you is, can you talk about the backwardation in the curve of in '19 and '20, and just what you're seeing out there on -- in terms of trends of new supply? Clearly, in recent weeks, we've seen some [ unmothballing ] of assets and things like that, so to be curious for an update."

So there is a few things that we did this time around on the earnings slides. The first is we provided you a position report specifically for Texas, which in the past, we haven't done, and we wanted to do that, so people would at least have a view in terms of -- for balance of the year how we're positioned. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month. Now what we -- like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer long, I'm not going to tell you how much, but we are. And we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. So matter of fact, we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us, and we just continue to do that going forward. The second thing is, we provided also the sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expect that prices will be paid. Obviously, we have to see how this summer plays out. Hopefully, with these are two additional elements, you can at least have an idea where, I would say, on a mark-to-market we would look like, but obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas. Now to your second question about the backwardation on the curve, Chris?"

It's obviously backwardated with $150 for this summer and then $125-ish for '19.

It's obviously backwardated with $150 for this summer and then $125-ish for '19. Quite frankly, I still think '19 has room to come up, and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in '19 still. When the final CERA came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back. Barney Davis was one that was around 300 megawatts. Gibbons Creek, I think, was always in the numbers or at least was no surprise to the market. That was -- that one was expected to come back. So there was a little bit of move there for this summer. Interestingly, though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve margin actually went down some. It was 11% -- 11.7%, I think, in the last CERA and this CDR came out at about 11%. What they did there was they actually reduced load by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced generation by 1,000. So it's kind of going in the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets [ in deck ] working, for instance, actually pushing back 3 years from '19 to 2022, I think, was the most recent number there. So wanted to see how that works. I mean, obviously, part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that new build situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that it's high enough or long enough to incent new build, and we're hoping that the rational new build is a thing of the past."

You need to see them high enough, and you need to see them long enough to attract this capital investment. Now we're -- we are not seeing actually the contrary, and we've been talking about that the slow down on new generation is very real, and you can still see it in the latest CDR or CERA report that Texas put out. And I think, Chris already mentioned, some of these units are being pushed out 1 or 2 years. With respect to other technologies, I don't see that really taking off with -- only with 1-year of high prices. I mean, they basically follow the same behavior as any combined cycle. I don't see Texas putting a program of -- out of market payments to see whether it's battery storage or other technologies like that. I mean, Texas has been very clear and ERCOT have been very clear in competitive market signals in energy-only market. And we just need to make sure that we just let it work."

All we are saying is that in the last auction, we saw almost half of the new builds that we have seen in the last 3 years.

On the other hand, you see the -- obviously, we just talked about state subsidies, zonal transfer and stagnant load. And I think you have pluses and minuses.

Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and I am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders.
So now turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well-positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March, where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top-decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast. Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $215 million in margin enhancements. 
Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018. Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program.
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day. Starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on Slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve this by being well positioned in attractive markets and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven. This is not just an attractive, but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to Retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strengths to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands. Our evolution has led us to rightsize our Generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic Generation and Retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity and while today it is not economic at current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our Retail business during periods of high prices.
Now by becoming better balanced, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable Retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA and a Generation business that is well positioned for a market recovery. Moreover, the low capital intensity of our Retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet, enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. 
The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform stability and upside. As you can see, our Retail earnings are fairly stable, whether prices go up or down, especially 1-year out. Our Generation business is more directly correlated to power prices and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to 0, because our Generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments. So when you combine these 2 businesses, you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced.
Now turning to Slide 6, with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program. We remain on track to achieve our target, and 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and '20. The lion's share of our targets comes from our Retail Mass business through 2 types of initiatives: value expansion; and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business. 
On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which first and foremost, supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After this, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022, the result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts and some modest growth in our Retail business. As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles because we are on track to achieve 3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year. We have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at or above our target hurdle rate and returning capital to our shareholders. These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback. 
So before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022. Now if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellent stewards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan.
Now moving to our markets and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in newbuild given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve margins. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly, with summer on-peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected Generation hedge. On the Retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced low for the balance of 2018. For this summer specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well positioned for high prices. 
So first let's talk about our Generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked hard this spring outage season to ensure our unit can withstand increased run times given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased outage insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages. Second, our Retail business, and as a matter of policy, is fully hedged against our priced Retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross Generation and Retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high-loads and high-price conditions. Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills. I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from upside this summer, should prices materialize.
So now turning to the East on Slide 8. The PJM Capacity Auction for planning year '21, '22 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations. Last auction saw a slowdown in newbuilds, and over 7 gigawatts of announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how this will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable. While some entities are rasping at bailouts in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market, and we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market-value proposition. Beyond PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low pockets. We remain optimistic about the continued calls to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well functioning of competitive markets.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,559439264,1447877,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 03, 2018",2018-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $17",697,"Thank you, Mauricio. 
Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield contributed $188 million and $189 million, respectively. Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas, and those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we're still only a few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. 
During the first quarter, NRG successfully repriced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to 175 over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million. Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar to NRG Yield, closing the first of several transformation planned asset sales we had announced in early February. And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our Board of Directors. Through the first quarter, we executed approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of $29.75. We continue to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We'll also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment of share repurchases once we have closed a more substantial portion of the asset sale as we had announced last February.
Turning to Slide 11. Our expected 2018 NRG level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds which are net of previously announced commitments, including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted at Analyst Day, this amount is $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update, as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM.
Finally, on Slide 12. Taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018.
Turning to a pro forma 2020 view of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance and including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020. The combination of both the $275 million in additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so. Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released, with that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders. In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash, including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.13 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Our path forward will generate significant excess cash by leveraging our strengths, capitalizing on market trends and making execution of our Transformation Plan our #1 priority.

Can you give us a little bit more commentary on how you think about your sensitivity? I know you released some kind of generic ones in the appendix here. But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about the potential upside into 2018? You haven't updated that for a little bit here. You also cautioned that your purchasing insurance and other things. I mean, should we think about the sensitivity here for '18 as being fairly linear? Or is there a sort of a capping out with collars and things like that? And then maybe a second question at the same time, I'll throw it to you is, can you talk about the backwardation in the curve of in '19 and '20, and just what you're seeing out there on -- in terms of trends of new supply? Clearly, in recent weeks, we've seen some [ unmothballing] of assets and things like that, so would be curious for an update."

So there is a few things that we did this time around on the earnings slides. The first is we provided you a position report specifically for Texas, which in the past, we haven't done, and we wanted to do that, so people would at least have a view in terms of -- for balance of the year how we're positioned. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month. Now what we -- like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer long, I'm not going to tell you how much, but we are. And we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. So matter of fact, we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us, and we just continue to do that going forward. The second thing is, we provided also the sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expect that prices will be paid. Obviously, we have to see how this summer plays out. Hopefully, with these 2 additional elements, you can at least have an idea where, I would say, on a mark-to-market we would look like, but obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas. Now to your second question about the backwardation on the curve, Chris?"

It's obviously backwardated with $150 for this summer and then $125-ish for '19. Quite frankly, I still think '19 has room to come up, and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in '19 still. When the final CERA came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back. Barney Davis was one that was around 300 megawatts. Gibbons Creek, I think, was already in the numbers or at least was no surprise to the market. That was -- that one was expected to come back. So there was a little bit of move there for this summer. Interestingly, though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve margin actually went down some. It was 11% -- 11.7%, I think, in the last CERA and this CDR came out at about 11%. What they did there was they actually reduced load by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced generation by 1,000. So it's kind of going the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets -- [ indeck ] Wharton, for instance, actually pushing back 3 years from '19 to 2022, I think, was the most recent number there. So wanted to see how that works. I mean, obviously, part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that newbuild situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that it's high enough for long enough to incent newbuild, and we're hoping that the irrational newbuild is a thing of the past."

Now I don't know what's going to happen in the next auction in terms of the slowdown in newbuilds. All we are saying is that in the last auction, we saw almost half of the newbuilds that we have seen in the last 3 years.

But in the first $500 million, just curious, is that driven by your -- the liquidity as you're seeing it? Is it driven by the way you see the price, which you think is being undervalued? Just curious how the thought process is in this current buyback program?"

Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and I am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders.
So now turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March, where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top-decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast. Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $215 million in margin enhancements. 
Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018. Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program.
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day. Starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on Slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve this by being well positioned in attractive markets and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven. This is not just an attractive, but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to Retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strengths to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands. Our evolution has led us to rightsize our Generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic Generation and Retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity and while today it is not economic at current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our Retail business during periods of high prices.
Now by becoming better balanced, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable Retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA and a Generation business that is well positioned for a market recovery. Moreover, the low capital intensity of our Retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet, enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. 
The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform stability and upside. As you can see, our Retail earnings are fairly stable, whether prices go up or down, especially 1-year out. Our Generation business is more directly correlated to power prices and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to 0, because our Generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments. So when you combine these 2 businesses, you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced.
Now turning to Slide 6, with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program. We remain on track to achieve our target, and 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and '20. The lion's share of our targets comes from our Retail Mass business through 2 types of initiatives: value expansion; and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business. 
On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which first and foremost, supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After this, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022, the result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts and some modest growth in our Retail business. As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles because we are on track to achieve 3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year. We have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at or above our target hurdle rate and returning capital to our shareholders. These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback. 
So before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022. Now if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellent stewards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan.
Now moving to our markets and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in newbuild given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve margins. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly, with summer on-peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected Generation hedge. On the Retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced low for the balance of 2018. For this summer specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well positioned for high prices. 
So first let's talk about our Generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked hard this spring outage season to ensure our unit can withstand increased run times given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased outage insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages. Second, our Retail business, and as a matter of policy, is fully hedged against our priced Retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross Generation and Retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high-loads and high-price conditions. Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills. I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from upside this summer, should prices materialize.
So now turning to the East on Slide 8. The PJM Capacity Auction for planning year '21, '22 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations. Last auction saw a slowdown in newbuilds, and over 7 gigawatts of announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how this will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable. While some entities are rasping at bailouts in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market, and we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market-value proposition. Beyond PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low pockets. We remain optimistic about the continued calls to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well functioning of competitive markets.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,559439264,1450640,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 03, 2018",2018-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $17",697,"Thank you, Mauricio. 
Turning to the financial summary, you'll find on Slide 10. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation and Renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield contributed $188 million and $189 million, respectively. Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas, and those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we're still only a few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. 
During the first quarter, NRG successfully repriced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to 175 over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million. Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar to NRG Yield, closing the first of several transformation planned asset sales we had announced in early February. And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our Board of Directors. Through the first quarter, we executed approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of $29.75. We continue to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We'll also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment of share repurchases once we have closed a more substantial portion of the asset sale as we had announced last February.
Turning to Slide 11. Our expected 2018 NRG level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds which are net of previously announced commitments, including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted at Analyst Day, this amount is $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update, as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM.
Finally, on Slide 12. Taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018.
Turning to a pro forma 2020 view of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance and including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020. The combination of both the $275 million in additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so. Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released, with that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders. In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash, including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.13 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

You also cautioned that your purchasing insurance and other things. I mean, should we think about the sensitivity here for '18 as being fairly linear? Or is there a sort of a capping out with collars and things like that? And then maybe a second question at the same time, I'll throw it to you is, can you talk about the backwardation in the curve of in '19 and '20, and just what you're seeing out there on -- in terms of trends of new supply? Clearly, in recent weeks, we've seen some [ unmothballing] of assets and things like that, so would be curious for an update."

The first is we provided you a position report specifically for Texas, which in the past, we haven't done, and we wanted to do that, so people would at least have a view in terms of -- for balance of the year how we're positioned. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month. Now what we -- like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer long, I'm not going to tell you how much, but we are. And we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. So matter of fact, we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us, and we just continue to do that going forward. The second thing is, we provided also the sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expect that prices will be paid. Obviously, we have to see how this summer plays out. Hopefully, with these 2 additional elements, you can at least have an idea where, I would say, on a mark-to-market we would look like, but obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas. Now to your second question about the backwardation on the curve, Chris?"

Quite frankly, I still think '19 has room to come up, and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in '19 still. When the final CERA came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back. Barney Davis was one that was around 300 megawatts. Gibbons Creek, I think, was already in the numbers or at least was no surprise to the market. That was -- that one was expected to come back. So there was a little bit of move there for this summer. Interestingly, though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve margin actually went down some. It was 11% -- 11.7%, I think, in the last CERA and this CDR came out at about 11%. What they did there was they actually reduced load by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced generation by 1,000. So it's kind of going the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets -- [ indeck ] Wharton, for instance, actually pushing back 3 years from '19 to 2022, I think, was the most recent number there. So wanted to see how that works. I mean, obviously, part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that newbuild situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that it's high enough for long enough to incent newbuild, and we're hoping that the irrational newbuild is a thing of the past."

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on Slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives, and we are on track to hit all targets. 
Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating once again the value of integration between Retail and Generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond.
So now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail and the impact of accretive cost savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and impact on our credit metrics. 
For the first half of the year, our businesses have performed exceptionally well, but with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call. 
During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback, in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback, following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio. 
I also want to follow the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. 
GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year. We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on Slide 5. 
During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the card to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018 with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for the current year and full plan targets.
As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM and our Spanish Talent asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in 2 additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had a selling these assets in 2019, but we were able to accelerate this time line and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule. 
Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the concerns. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as sweetly as possible and are working hard to make this at third quarter close. 
The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to strengthen that this transaction will close in the second half of this year. Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on Slide 6. 
As you all know, ERCOT supply demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years. Following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady low growth. This market tightening led to an increase probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices. 
So far, the man now disappointed, setting a new record of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record low was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. 
In other words, it took nearly perfect systemwide reliability to meet the summer peak demand. Now our Generation fleet performance did extremely well this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation report going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. We also took measures to ensure the stability of our Retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with Generation to have managed supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills. This market conditions in Texas also created longer-term opportunities to incur the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at an attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and off-peak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those 10 years. And in this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increased the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer. And historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So we are at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring that successful summer.
Now moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT from Slide 7. Much like the summer, the longer-term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand charts on a weather normalized basis, total loans remain very robust and growing and continue to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. 
We also continue to see project delays of Generation -- of new Generation anywhere between 3 to 5 years. And given that forward prices remain below new bill economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term. So bottom line and for the foreseeable future, we expect margins in ERCOT of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.
Our Retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market, due to the integration with Generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers, while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from our competitors. And our Generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also higher hedge prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings and mitigate the impact of volatility on our Retail business.
Now onto the East on Slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021, 2022 this past May. The results reflected new builds and significant amount of uncleared capacity. Signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts and higher prices than the previous auction. As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium zone, which once again separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt day. 
Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our Generation and Retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting up price floor on Generation. This is a strong and clear provocative position coming out of FERC. 
As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as a fixed resources requirement, or FRR. We believe these requests for commands and the idea of taking a single units out of the market is counter to the first rule. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fixed FRR to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation or perhaps in entirety. That said, details matter, and we're looking forward attractive engaging on this issue both with PJM and FERC. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA versus 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices in Retail Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on Transformation Plan. 
And for the first half of the year, NRG delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and summer prices in ERCOT continue to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. 
We'll note, however, that our first half results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year currently plays our expectations for '18 well above the midpoint of our guidance range, and we will update and narrow these changes on our third quarter call. At that time, we will also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancement with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets. 
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed the Phase 1 of our $1 billion share buyback program with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price -- average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our 2 large asset sales transactions and the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these 2 transactions to close just like we did the sale of NRG Yield and renewables later this quarter. During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we  retire shorter dated and higher coupon maturities. 
To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of maturities to date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance. 
As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio. 
And finally this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement of which accelerated a significant portion of the items that in the original restructuring support agreement, including the $261 million payment by energy and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at merchants. 
With the financial commitments with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergency for bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter. 
Next I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you will find on Slide 11. As a reminder, this summer is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retain businesses, net of any contribution from businesses and assets we are selling as part of the Transformation Plan. On the left side of the slide, under the heading prior pro forma, we start with a pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call. 
Next, 2 second quarter events give rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the item nonrecourse project debt and the amendment of some of the projects governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements, but will appear as an equity investment. 
On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the mid point of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of this consolidation is the elimination of our partners 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah reflecting on the energies of 55% stake in our revised pro forma. 
Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total nonrecourse debt was approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet. 
Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma deal. With the closing of the Xoom acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the Retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis, while the actual contribution for XOOM towards 2018 results will be partially year reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year. 
The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for Xoom. And as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is is limited to EBITDA. And as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised to follow consolidated free cash flow growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion. 
And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow for the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which include the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets. 
Turning to Slide 12 for very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million. As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year. 
As a result of both the reduction and committed capital towards GenOn as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital shown far right has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $7 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocate.
Finally, on Slide 13. We began provided the 2018 pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised to a pro forma EBITDA, which are viewed earlier, is largely unchanged for our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is smaller due to the impact of the deconsolidation. As a reminder in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond '18 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020, while still maintaining that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. 
Having previously focused exclusively on 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan in these updates, this quarter we're also providing 2 additional key credit metrics, adjusted cash from operations from net debt as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet, credit profile. 
Although we remain a double B-rated company, this rating is not fully relative strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution, continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our provend and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn and proved credit rating. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

On the one hand, the lack of really, really high levels of volatility, the summer despite the strong load has been disconcerting to some investors, who thought that those high level of volatility would validate around the Texas market and your long-term view on power market there. On the other hand, the lack of massive volatility has allowed you to continue to print stable profit margins and actually do some really solid hedging that may or may not been actually may be upside relative to what you probably in your outlook. So from a business perspective, what you would rather see the conditions you have now or massive levels of volatility that put more stress on the business to potentially bring faster new entry cycle?"

And what I was very pleased to see the summary is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally the even in the month that you will see the most extreme weather wasn't very encouraging. So when you think about the fundamental picture of supply and demand the timing that exceeds, it hasn't changed. And actually the summer is validated that is for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw the summer is just a combination of few things. One was a pretty strong demand, but that strong demand was met with like I said, perfect performance by degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the post just that we had in that peak. And I mean, there were quite remarkable and also wind performed as expected close to normal. So obviously when you have these type of situation, yes, I mean, real-time prices where below what people were expecting, they're not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want the market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both Generation and Retail like the one we had in Texas. So that is a perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing to low that necessarily doesn't reflect, the fundamentals of the market and thus why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT. But also we don't want to see a situation where when you will see -- where you have pricing that leads to a perhaps initiating shaving And none of those 2 extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of Generation and Retail is somewhere in the middle. So the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see, the fundamentals impacts are incredibly strong, and they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they have been rising, but they're not the point that I economy. So supply continues to be delay on new Generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning not that it is balancing on each either side of the"

We need to get through the summer in order to start to build that cash. So as we come into the fall, our cash balances begin to appreciate. In the interim, during the summer months, while still waiting on that cash, that also tends to be the most significant draw of liquidity, which we have ample supply of, but we have to be prepared that if we do see scarcity prices events or the anticipation thereof in the forward market, that then entails a need for posting additional collateral.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on Slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives, and we are on track to hit all targets. Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating, once again, the value of integration between Retail and Generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond.
So now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail loads and the impact of accretive cost savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and the impact on our credit metrics.
For the first half of the year, our business has performed exceptionally well. But with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And as has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call.
During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback, in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback, following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio.
I also want to follow the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year.
We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on Slide 5. During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the card to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018, with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for the current year and full plan targets.
As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing, or BETM, and our Spanish Town asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in 2 additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had anticipated selling these assets in 2019, but we were able to accelerate this time line and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule.
Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the consents. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as swiftly as possible and are working hard to make this a third quarter close.
The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to expect that this transaction will close in the second half of this year.
Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on Slide 6. And as you all know, ERCOT supply-demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years, following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady low growth. This market tightening led to an increase probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices.
So far, demand has not disappointed, setting a new record peak of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record load was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which tamper real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. In other words, it took nearly perfect systemwide reliability to meet the summer peak demand.
Now our Generation fleet performed exceedingly well during this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation we put going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. We also took measures to ensure the stability of our Retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with Generation to help manage supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills. These tight market conditions in Texas also created longer-term opportunities to incur the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and offpeak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those same years. I mean, this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increased the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer. And historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So we all at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring a successful summer.
Now moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Much like this summer, the longer term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand charts, on a weather normalized basis, total loads remain very robust and growing -- and continues to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. We also continue to see project delays of Generation -- of new Generation anywhere between 3 to 5 years. And given that forward prices remain below new build economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term. So bottom line and for the foreseeable future, we expect tight reserve margins in ERCOT with higher probability of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.
Our Retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market due to the integration with Generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers, while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from other competitors. And our Generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also higher hedge prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings and mitigate the impact of volatility on our Retail business.
Now onto the East on Slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021/2022 this past May. The results reflected less new builds and significant amounts of uncleared capacity, signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts at higher prices than the previous auction. As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium COMED zone, which once again separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt-day.
Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our Generation and Retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting a price floor on subsidized generation. This is a strong and clear procompetitive position coming out of FERC. 
As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as the fixed resource requirement, or FRR. We believe this request for comments and the idea of taking single units out of the market is counter to the spirit of first rule. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fix the FRR to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation or perhaps rejected in its entirety. That said, details matter, and we're looking forward to actively engaging on this issue, both with PJM and FERC.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices in Retail load in Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. And for the first half of the year, NRG has delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and the summer prices in ERCOT continue to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow.
We'll note, however, that our first half results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year currently place our expectations for '18 well above the midpoint of our guidance range, and we will update and narrow these changes on our third quarter call. At that time, we'll also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancement, with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed Phase 1 of our $1 billion share buyback program, with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price -- average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our 2 large asset sale transactions, and we'll watch the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these 2 transactions to close, which is likely to be the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables later this quarter. During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we  retire shorter-dated and higher-coupon maturities. To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of varying maturities to date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance.
As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio.
And finally this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement with GenOn, which accelerated a significant portion of the item set put forth in the original restructuring support agreement, including the $261 million settlement payment by NRG and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at emergence.
With the financial commitments associated with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced in its [indiscernible] efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergence from bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter.
Next I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you'll find on Slide 11. As a reminder, this summer is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retained businesses, net of any contribution for businesses and assets we are selling as a part of the Transformation Plan. On the left side of the slide, under the heading Prior Pro Forma, we start with the pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call.
Next, 2 second quarter events gave rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the Ivanpah nonrecourse project debt and the amendment of some of the projects governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in the accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements, but will appear as an equity investment. On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the midpoint of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of deconsolidation is the elimination of our partners' 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA, leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah reflecting only NRG's 55% stake in our revised pro forma.
Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total nonrecourse debt of approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet.
Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma view. With the closing of the XOOM acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the Retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis, while the actual contribution for XOOM towards 2018 results will be a partial year reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year.
The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for XOOM. And as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is limited to EBITDA. And as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised pro forma consolidated free cash flow before growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion. 
And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow are based on the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which includes the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets.
Turning to Slide 12 for a very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is having now settled most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital outlay for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million. As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid, is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year.
As a result of both the reduction and committed capital towards GenOn as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales, previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital, shown on the far right, has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $700 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocated.
Finally, on Slide 13. We've again provided the 2018 pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio, all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised pro forma EBITDA, which I reviewed earlier, and is largely unchanged from our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is now smaller due to the impact of deconsolidation. As a reminder, in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond '18 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives, again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020, while still maintaining that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Having previously focused exclusively on the 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan and these updates, this quarter we're also providing 2 additional key credit metrics, adjusted cash from operations from net debt as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet credit profile.
Although we remain a BB rated company, this rating does not fully reflect the strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our proved and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn an improved credit rating.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Well, first is -- I think that you need to look at the fundamentals in Texas. And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real.

And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally the -- even the month that you see, the most extreme weather was very encouraging. So when you think about the fundamental picture of ERCOT the supply-demand and the tightness that exists, it hasn't changed. And actually this summer has validated that is here for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw this summer is just a combination of few things. One was a very strong demand, but that strong demand was met with, like I said, perfect performance by degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the forced outages that we had in that peak. They -- and I mean, they were quite remarkable. And also wind performed as expected, very close to normal. So obviously, when you have this type of situation, yes, I mean, real-time prices were below what people were expecting. They are not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want a market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both Generation and Retail, like the one we have in Texas. So that is the perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing too low, that necessarily doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the market, and that's why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT. But also we don't want to see a situation where you'll see -- where you have scarcity pricing that leads to perhaps shaving low. And none of those 2 extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of Generation and Retail is somewhere in the middle. So the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see, the fundamentals impacts are incredibly strong, and they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, even if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they have been rising, but they are not at the point that incentivize newbuild economics. So supply continues to be delayed on new Generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning, not that is balancing on each -- either side of extremes."

Firstly, overall, the answer is, yes. And the reason I say that is you can look no further to the fact is when we first established guidance for '18, for example, that would be in the third quarter of the the previous year, third quarter '17. Generally speaking, our guidance is centered around the midpoint of our expectations, and those expectations are informed by what the summer prices are, in this case in '18 at that time. And I think since our pro forma view is all anchored on that '18, the degree to which '19 and '20 summer prices today, for example, are higher than were '18 summer was at the time we established our guidance. And I can tell you the answer to that question is, yes. And you can quantify it by looking back. That would give rise to the fact that all things being equal, that would give rise to an increase in that pro forma view since '18 would be higher than it would have been expected at that time. And as I said, I confirm that our expectations are well above the midpoint of our range currently for '18."

So in the -- so that -- so those 2 net out to be give or take 500 megawatts better than the CERA and the CERA had around 1,000 megawatts of space in it. So we really didn't get into the position where we needed a ton of other things to come to bear to save the market. I will say that the market -- it was an interesting setup because Thursday wasn't supposed to be the high day. This is the 19th, that was supposed to be that following Monday, the 23rd, which was actually forecasted over 76,000 megawatts for the better part of that week.

But if you take a step back, the big portion of the adjustment, if you will, to get to a pro forma view is a portfolio that consists of 2 things primarily, one being LaGen which is kind of an integrated type of business, not to say it doesn't have upside and downside. And the bulk of what remains is Yield, which is largely contracted, relatively low volatility, right. And you can look at because Yield provides point estimates on their own guidance, which is largely unchanged.

We need to get through the summer in order to start to build that cash. So as we come into the fall, our cash balances begin to appreciate. In the interim, during the summer months, while still waiting on that cash, that also tends to be the more significant draw on liquidity, which we have ample supply of, but we have to be prepared that if we do see scarcity price events or the anticipation thereof in the forward market, that then entails a need for posting additional collateral. So we have to balance the liquidity, the reality that the organic cash flow is back-end loaded, supplemented by the receipt of the asset sale proceeds, which is, obviously, determined on closing.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on Slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives, and we are on track to hit all targets. Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating, once again, the value of integration between Retail and Generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond.
So now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail loads and the impact of accretive cost savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and the impact on our credit metrics.
For the first half of the year, our business has performed exceptionally well. But with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And as has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call.
During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback, in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback, following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio.
I also want to highlight the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year.
We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on Slide 5. During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the path to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018, with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for their current year and full plan targets.
As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing, or BETM, and our Spanish Town asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in 2 additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had anticipated selling these assets in 2019, but we were able to accelerate this time line and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule.
Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the consents. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as swiftly as possible and are working hard to make this a third quarter close.
The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to expect that this transaction will close in the second half of this year.
Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on Slide 6. And as you all know, ERCOT supply-demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years, following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady load growth. This market tightening led to an increased probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices.
So far, demand has not disappointed, setting a new record peak of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record load was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which temper real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. In other words, it took nearly perfect systemwide reliability to meet the summer peak demand.
Now our Generation fleet performed exceedingly well during this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation we put going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. 
We also took measures to ensure the stability of our Retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with Generation to help manage supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills. 
These tight market conditions in Texas also created longer-term opportunities to incur the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. 
We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and offpeak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those same years. 
I mean, this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increase the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer. And historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So we all at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring a successful summer.
Now moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Much like this summer, the longer term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand charts, on a weather normalized basis, total loads remain very robust and growing -- and continues to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. 
We also continue to see project delays of Generation -- of new Generation anywhere between 3 to 5 years. And given that forward prices remain below new build economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term. 
So bottom line and for the foreseeable future, we expect tight reserve margins in ERCOT with higher probability of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.
Our Retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market due to the integration with Generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers, while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from other competitors. And our Generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also higher hedge prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings and mitigate the impact of volatility on our Retail business.
Now onto the East on Slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021/2022 this past May. The results reflected less new builds and significant amounts of uncleared capacity, signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. 
As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts at higher prices than the previous auction. As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium COMED zone, which once again separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt-day.
Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our Generation and Retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting a price floor on subsidized generation. This is a strong and clear pro-competitive position coming out of FERC. 
As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as the fixed resource requirement, or FRR. We believe this request for comments and the idea of taking single units out of the market is counter to the spirit of FERC's rule. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fix the FRR to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation or perhaps reject it in its entirety. 
That said, details matter, and we're looking forward to actively engaging on this issue, both with PJM and FERC.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

Turning first to the financial summary you'll find on Slide 10. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primaril",1423,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary you'll find on Slide 10. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices in Retail load in Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. And for the first half of the year, NRG has delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. 
Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and the summer prices in ERCOT continue to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow.
I will note, however, that our first half results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year currently place our expectations for '18 well above the midpoint of our guidance range, and we will update and narrow these ranges on our third quarter call. At that time, we'll also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancement, with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed Phase 1 of our $1 billion share buyback program, with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price -- average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our 2 large asset sale transactions, and we'll launch the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these 2 transactions to close, which is likely to be the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables later this quarter. 
During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we  retire shorter-dated and higher-coupon maturities. To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of varying maturities to date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance.
As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio.
And finally this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement with GenOn, which accelerated a significant portion of the item set put forth in the original restructuring support agreement, including the $261 million settlement payment by NRG and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at emergence.
With the financial commitments associated with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced in its [ add to sale ] efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergence from bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter.
Next I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you'll find on Slide 11. As a reminder, this summary is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retained businesses, net of any contribution for businesses and assets we are selling as a part of the Transformation Plan. On the left side of the slide, under the heading Prior Pro Forma, we start with the pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call.
Next, 2 second quarter events give rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the Ivanpah nonrecourse project debt and the amendment of some of the project's governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in the accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements, but will appear as an equity investment. On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the midpoint of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of deconsolidation is the elimination of our partners' 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA, leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah, reflecting only NRG's 55% stake in our revised pro forma.
Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total nonrecourse debt of approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet.
Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma view. With the closing of the XOOM acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the Retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis, while the actual contribution for XOOM to our 2018 results will be a partial year reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year.
The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for XOOM. And as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is limited to EBITDA. And as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised pro forma consolidated free cash flow before growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion. 
And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow are based on the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which includes the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets.
Turning to Slide 12 for a very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is having now settled most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital outlay for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million. As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid, is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year.
As a result of both the reduction in committed capital towards GenOn as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales, previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital, shown on the far right, has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $700 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocated.
Finally, on Slide 13. We've again provided the 2018 pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio, all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised pro forma EBITDA, which I reviewed earlier, and is largely unchanged from our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is now smaller due to the impact of deconsolidation. 
As a reminder, in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond '18 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives, again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020, while still maintaining that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Having previously focused exclusively on the 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan in these updates, this quarter we are also providing 2 additional key credit metrics, adjusted cash from operations to net debt as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet credit profile.
Although we remain a BB rated company, this rating does not fully reflect the strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution, continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our proved and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn an improved credit rating.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Well, first is the -- I think that you need to look at the fundamentals in Texas. And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real.

And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally the -- even the month that you see the most extreme weather, was very encouraging. So when you think about the fundamental picture of ERCOT, the supply-demand and the tightness that exists, it hasn't changed. And actually this summer has validated that it's here for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw this summer is just a combination of a few things. One was a very strong demand, but that strong demand was met with, like I said, perfect performance by degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the forced outages that we had in that peak day. And I mean, they were quite remarkable. And also wind performed as expected, very close to normal. So obviously, when you have this type of a situation -- yes, I mean, real-time prices were below what people were expecting. They are not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want a market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both Generation and Retail, like the one we have in Texas. So that is the perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing too low, that necessarily doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the market, and that's why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT. But also we don't want to see a situation where you see -- where you have the scarcity pricing that leads to perhaps shaving low. And none of those 2 extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of Generation and Retail is somewhere in the middle. So the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see, the fundamentals in Texas are incredibly strong, and they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, even if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they have been rising, but they are not at the point that are incentivized newbuild economics. So supply continues to be delayed on new Generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning, not that is bouncing on each -- either side of the extremes."

First, overall, the answer is, yes. And the reason I say that is you can look no further to the fact just when we first established guidance for '18, for example, that would be in the third quarter of the previous year, third quarter '17. Generally speaking, our guidance is centered around the midpoint of our expectations, and those expectations are informed by what the summer prices are, in this case in '18 at that time. And I think since our pro forma view is all anchored on that '18, the degree to which '19 and '20 summer prices today, for example, are higher than where '18 summer was at the time we established our guidance. And I can tell you the answer to that question is, yes. And you can quantify it by looking back. That would give rise to the fact that all things being equal, that would give rise to an increase in that pro forma view since '18, it would be higher than it would have been expected at the time.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on Slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives, and we are on track to hit all targets. Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating, once again, the value of integration between Retail and Generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond.
So now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail loads and the impact of accretive cost savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and the impact on our credit metrics.
For the first half of the year, our business has performed exceptionally well. But with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And as has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call.
During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback, in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback, following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio.
I also want to highlight the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year.
We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on Slide 5. During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the path to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018, with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for their current year and full plan targets.
As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing, or BETM, and our Spanish Town asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in 2 additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had anticipated selling these assets in 2019, but we were able to accelerate this time line and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule.
Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the consents. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as swiftly as possible and are working hard to make this a third quarter close.
The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to expect that this transaction will close in the second half of this year.
Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on Slide 6. And as you all know, ERCOT supply-demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years, following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady load growth. This market tightening led to an increased probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices.
So far, demand has not disappointed, setting a new record peak of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record load was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which temper real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. In other words, it took nearly perfect systemwide reliability to meet the summer peak demand.
Now our Generation fleet performed exceedingly well during this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation we put going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. 
We also took measures to ensure the stability of our Retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with Generation to help manage supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills. 
These tight market conditions in Texas also created longer-term opportunities to incur the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. 
We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and off-peak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those same years. 
I mean, this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increase the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer. And historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So we all at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring a successful summer.
Now moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT on Slide 7. Much like this summer, the longer term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand charts, on a weather normalized basis, total loads remain very robust and growing -- and continues to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. 
We also continue to see project delays of Generation -- of new Generation anywhere between 3 to 5 years. And given that forward prices remain below new build economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term. 
So bottom line and for the foreseeable future, we expect tight reserve margins in ERCOT with higher probability of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.
Our Retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market due to the integration with Generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers, while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from other competitors. And our Generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also higher hedge prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings and mitigate the impact of volatility on our Retail business.
Now onto the East on Slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021/2022 this past May. The results reflected less new builds and significant amounts of uncleared capacity, signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. 
As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts at higher prices than the previous auction. As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium COMED zone, which once again separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt-day.
Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our Generation and Retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting a price floor on subsidized generation. This is a strong and clear pro-competitive position coming out of FERC. 
As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as the fixed resource requirement, or FRR. We believe this request for comments and the idea of taking single units out of the market is counter to the spirit of FERC's rule. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fix the FRR to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation or perhaps reject it in its entirety. 
That said, details matter, and we're looking forward to actively engaging on this issue, both with PJM and FERC.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices in Retail load in Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. And for the first half of the year, NRG has delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. 
Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and the summer prices in ERCOT continue to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow.
I will note, however, that our first half results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year currently place our expectations for '18 well above the midpoint of our guidance range, and we will update and narrow these ranges on our third quarter call. At that time, we'll also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancement, with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed Phase 1 of our $1 billion share buyback program, with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price -- average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our 2 large asset sale transactions, and we'll launch the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these 2 transactions to close, which is likely to be the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables later this quarter. 
During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we retire shorter-dated and higher-coupon maturities. To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of varying maturities to date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance.
As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio.
And finally this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement with GenOn, which accelerated a significant portion of the item set put forth in the original restructuring support agreement, including the $261 million settlement payment by NRG and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at emergence.
With the financial commitments associated with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced in its [ add to sale ] efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergence from bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you'll find on Slide 11. As a reminder, this summary is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retained businesses, net of any contribution for businesses and assets we are selling as a part of the Transformation Plan. On the left side of the slide, under the heading Prior Pro Forma, we start with the pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call.
Next, 2 second quarter events give rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the Ivanpah nonrecourse project debt and the amendment of some of the project's governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in the accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements but will appear as an equity investment. On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the midpoint of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of deconsolidation is the elimination of our partners' 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA, leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah, reflecting only NRG's 55% stake in our revised pro forma.
Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total nonrecourse debt of approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet.
Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma view. With the closing of the XOOM acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the Retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis, while the actual contribution for XOOM to our 2018 results will be a partial year reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year.
The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for XOOM. And as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is limited to EBITDA. And as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised pro forma consolidated free cash flow before growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion. 
And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow are based on the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which includes the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets.
Turning to Slide 12 for a very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is having now settled most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital outlay for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million. As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid, is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year.
As a result of both the reduction in committed capital towards GenOn as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales, previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital, shown on the far right, has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $700 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocated.
Finally, on Slide 13. We've again provided the 2018 pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio, all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised pro forma EBITDA, which I reviewed earlier, and is largely unchanged from our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is now smaller due to the impact of deconsolidation. 
As a reminder, in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond '18 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives, again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020, while still maintaining that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Having previously focused exclusively on the 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan in these updates, this quarter we are also providing 2 additional key credit metrics, adjusted cash from operations to net debt as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet credit profile.
Although we remain a BB-rated company, this rating does not fully reflect the strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution, continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our proved and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn an improved credit rating.

Our integrated platform is working as designed through the volatile summer months and remains well positioned for tight market conditions in the future. As I said, winning the summer and closing on our announced asset sales is our most immediate focus. I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing you more clarity on our capital allocation as we move into the second half of the year.

On the one hand, the lack of really, really high levels of volatility this summer despite the strong load has been disconcerting to some investors, who thought that those high levels of volatility would validate the thesis on the Texas market and your long-term view on the power market there. And on the other hand, the lack of massive volatility has allowed you to continue to print stable profit margins and actually do some really solid hedging that may or may not have been, actually, maybe upside relative to what you promulgated in your outlook. So from a business perspective, what would you rather see, the conditions you have now or massive levels of volatility that put more stress on the business and potentially bring a faster new entry cycle?"

Well, first is the -- I think that you need to look at the fundamentals in Texas. And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real.

And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally the -- even the month that you see the most extreme weather, was very encouraging. So when you think about the fundamental picture of ERCOT, the supply-demand and the tightness that exists, it hasn't changed. And actually this summer has validated that it's here for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw this summer is just a combination of a few things. One was a very strong demand, but that strong demand was met with, like I said, perfect performance by degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the forced outages that we had in that peak day. And I mean, they were quite remarkable. And also wind performed as expected, very close to normal. So obviously, when you have this type of a situation -- yes, I mean, real-time prices were below what people were expecting. They are not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want a market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both Generation and Retail, like the one we have in Texas. So that is the perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing too low, that necessarily doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the market, and that's why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT. But also we don't want to see a situation where you see -- where you have the scarcity pricing that leads to perhaps shaving low. And none of those 2 extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of Generation and Retail is somewhere in the middle. So the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see, the fundamentals in Texas are incredibly strong, and they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, even if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they have been rising, but they are not at the point that are incentivized newbuild economics. So supply continues to be delayed on new Generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning, not that is bouncing on each -- either side of the extremes."

And I can tell you the answer to that question is, yes. And you can quantify it by looking back. That would give rise to the fact that all things being equal, that would give rise to an increase in that pro forma view since '18, it would be higher than it would have been expected at the time. And as I said, I confirm that our expectations are well above the midpoint of our range currently for '18."

When I go back and if we look on the slide that Mauricio was talking about, I mean, load was about 500 megawatts -- or just talking about the peak hour on the 19th there, load was around 500 megawatts higher or worse compared to the CERA expectation. You had Generation around 1,000 megawatts better, which was just really flawless execution across the grid. And I'm happy to say we put in some extra spring outages to be ready and that really paid off for us. We had fantastic performance from the operations group. So anyway, so that -- those 2 net out to be, give or take, 500 megawatts better than the CERA and the CERA had around 1,000 megawatts of space in it. So we really didn't get into the position where we needed a ton of other things to come to bear to save the market. I will say that the market -- it was an interesting setup because Thursday wasn't supposed to be the high day. So this is the 19th. It was supposed to be that following Monday, the 23rd, which was actually forecast at over 76,000 megawatts for the better part of that week. And so I think a lot of the DR and what not was being prepared to be brought to bear on that Monday, and they may have missed the party a little bit because it turned out to be that Thursday was the high day."

But if you take a step back, the big portion of the adjustment, if you will, to get to a pro forma view is a portfolio that consists of 2 things primarily, one being LaGen, which is kind of an integrated type of business, not to say it doesn't have upside and downside. And the bulk of what remains is Yield, which is largely contracted, relatively low volatility, right. And you can look at, because Yield provides point estimates on their own guidance, which is largely unchanged.

We need to get through the summer in order to start to build that cash. So as we come into the fall, our cash balances begin to appreciate. In the interim, during the summer months, while still waiting on that cash, that also tends to be the more significant draw on liquidity, which we have ample supply of, but we have to be prepared that if we do see scarcity price events or the anticipation thereof in the forward market, that then entails a need for posting additional collateral. So we have to balance the liquidity, the reality that the organic cash flow is back-end loaded, supplemented by the receipt of the asset sale proceeds, which is, obviously, determinant on closing.

And thank you for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our Transformation Plan performance. Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to right size our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformation of planned asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now looking to margin enhancement in 2019. Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan. 
Moving to our third quarter business update on Slide 5. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost-saving initiatives, while achieving top quartile safety results. I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during the period of extreme price volatility.
As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits, while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.
Our year-to-date results now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which sits at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last 2 months. During the third quarter, we also launched a second $500 million share repurchase, following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.
Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019.
Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.
Turning to Slide 6, with our Transformation Plan update. We continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year 2018 targets. To September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives. We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close our central by year end, as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and that will reach COV in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is a result of having only of the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time given the improving market conditions.
Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3x net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2018, after having executed our deleveraging objectives.
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at this summer. As you can see on the slide, weather was warmer than normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While loads were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations. In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near-perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than the ones expected at the beginning of the summer. In the West, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restrictive gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we have said that the combination of 1 unit retirements and the emergence of community choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices.
In the East, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations, and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy. 
Now looking forward on Slide 8, and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT.
As we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements and additional delays or cancellations of new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments. On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional Generation. Currently the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants.
These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins, have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020. This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the. We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward.
One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that costs from renewable Generation. As you know, this is nondispatchable capacity, and therefore could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of Generation available to serve load. 
Now moving to the East. The focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is on just unreasonable due to the negative impact of subsidized units. Let me reiterate that we believe a strong moper is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market.
PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status pool and are positive for our portfolio.
Next month, it will be 3 years since I became CEO of the company. And while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record.
Particularly in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our capital allocation for the past 3 years. As you may recall, we initially focused on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017. With the announcement of our Transformation Plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the under valuation of our own stock. As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental 500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide.
I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call, as we have done in the past. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,587100979,1597681,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quart",2181,"Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale. Through the first 9 months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost-savings target of $500 million.
With these solid results and the important summer month now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance toward the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions, which I'm pleased to announce are now completed, we've now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors, but makes the achievement of our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent.
As you recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in 2 parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets, sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer and through an arrangement with the financial institution, which capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt-reduction target for 2018.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place of $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR with the financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares, which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program. The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR, which will be completed by the end of 2018. In addition, we now have a new authorization for additional 500 million in share repurchases, which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital.
Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 12. Given the significant impact of deconsolidation resulting from asset sales and our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first to take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018, which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago.
That consolidated guidance included the expected full year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales, which included everything we've closed on to date, such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM as well as our South Central business. Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect towards the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year.
That second call reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow, respectively.
Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled Previous Guidance Adjusted for Asset Sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance showing in the last column on the right.
Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales.
Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to seel to NRG Yield or Clear Way in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018.
In total, these 2 items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA, included within both the Generation segment as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these 2 items will contribute to our results going forward and does not include it in our 2019 financial guidance.
Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid 2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million, and our 2019 guidance reflects that. So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 13.
2019 will be the first year since we announced the Transformation Plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses, and our simplified and further strength in the balance. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation, and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance.
Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add 2 items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of Transformation Plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019 and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement, which increases to $135 million in 2019.
Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply cost that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply cost to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019.
Next, on Slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation.
As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in second quarter highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization, we have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks.
The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide and primarily consists of the following: first, is shown in Item A. Based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clear Way and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019. Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions, as I mentioned earlier, as well as other liability management activities year-to-date.
Finally, we've reduced the expected expected allocation to Transformation Plan cost to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 capital allocation, which I'll review next on Slide 15.
Turning to 2019 excess capital on Slide 15. We began with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, plus about $70 million of unallocated in 2018 capital from the previous slide. Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente, both of which are expected to close in the first quarter.
Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3x ratio. Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance next year for capital allocation, as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
I'll review all this in further detail on the next slide. However, it's important to note that, as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020.
Our more robust EBITDA are reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to releases capital for allocation effectively 1 year earlier than previously expected, and is the reason why although we now allocated an additional $500 million towards share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous one at $2.6 billion.
Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on Slide 16. In column 1, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining 3x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $915 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018, reached to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt. For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales, which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effective. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million reached pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018.
As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization, which will only be necessary to 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio. 
Turning to 2019. As I mentioned earlier, that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance, allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve or basically 3x the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Finally, as a reminder, in 2020, we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA from margin enhancement programs, which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside, combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform, helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that, we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail. So we can actually achieve that rebalancing in 2 ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us. We know that the Retail space has been very active. But -- and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and federal rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or -- to one specific one. To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019? I would say that there are 3 different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders in both ways, share buybacks given the under evaluation of our stock it is today and that was a preferred one. But we also have another avenue and we are open to it it is dividends. And then finally, we also have to evaluate continue paying down debt. And while we are completely comfortable with 3x today, that doesn't mean that in the future it's something that we just sell it and forget it. So that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy."

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper-half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our Transformation Plan performance. 
Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to right size our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformation of planned asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019. 
Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan. 
Moving to our third quarter business update on Slide 5. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives, while achieving top quartile safety results. I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility.
As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits, while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.
Our year-to-date results now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last 2 months. 
During the third quarter, we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.
Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our Transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019.  Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.
Turning to Slide 6 with our Transformation Plan update. We continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives. 
We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including, expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. 
With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close out Central by year-end, as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and Carlsbad will reach COD in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is the result of having only Agua Caliente and the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time given the improving market conditions.  
Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3x net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2018 after having executed our deleveraging objectives.
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at this summer. As you can see on the slide, weather was warmer-than-normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While load were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations. 
In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near-perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than the ones expected at the beginning of the summer. 
In the West, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restricted gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we assert that the combination of water cooling units retirements and the emergence of community choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices.
In the East, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations, and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy. 
Now looking forward on Slide 8, and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT.  As we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements and additional delays or cancellations of new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments. On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional generation. 
Currently, the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants.  These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins, have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020. This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the cap.  We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward.
One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that comes from renewable generation. As you know, this is non-dispatchable capacity, and therefore, could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of generation available to serve load. 
Now moving to the East. The focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is unjust and unreasonable due to the negative impact of subsidized units. Let me reiterate that we believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market.
PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status quo and are positive for our portfolio.
Next month, it will be 3 years since I became CEO of the company. And while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record, particularly, in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our capital allocation for the past 3 years. As you may recall, we initially focused on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017. 
With the announcement of our Transformation Plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the under valuation of our own stock. 
As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental $500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide.  I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call as we have done in the past. 
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."
413857,587100979,1598112,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quart",2182,"Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale. 
Through the first 9 months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost-savings target of $500 million.  With these solid results and the important summer month now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance towards the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions, which I'm pleased to announce are now completed, we have now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors, but makes the achievement of our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent.
As you'll recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in 2 parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets, sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer, and through an arrangement with the financial institution, effectively capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt reduction target for 2018.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR with the financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares, which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program.  
The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR, which will be completed by the end of 2018.  In addition, we now have a new authorization for additional $500 million in share repurchases, which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital.
Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 12. Given the significant impact of deconsolidation resulting from asset sales in our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first to take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. 
Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018, which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago.  That consolidated guidance included the expected full year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. 
As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales, which included everything we've closed on to-date, such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM as well as our South Central business. Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect towards the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year.
That second column reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow, respectively.  Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled, Previous Guidance Adjusted for Asset Sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance shown in the last column on the right.
Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales.
Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. 
First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to sell to NRG Yield or Clearway in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018.
In total, these 2 items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA, included within both the Generation segment as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these 2 items will contribute to our results going forward and are thus not included in our 2019 financial guidance.
Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid 2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million, and our 2019 guidance reflects that. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 13.  2019 will be the first year since we announced the Transformation Plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses, and are simplified and further strengthen the balance. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation, and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance.
Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add 2 items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of Transformation Plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019 and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement, which increases to $135 million in 2019.
Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply costs that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply costs to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019.
Next on Slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation.  As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in the second quarter highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization, we have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks.
The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide and primarily consists of the following: first, as shown in Item A, based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clearway and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019. Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions I mentioned earlier, as well as other liability management activities year-to-date.  Finally, we've reduced the expected allocation to Transformation Plan costs to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 capital allocation, which I'll review next on Slide 15.
Turning to 2019 excess capital on Slide 15. We began with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, plus about $70 million of unallocated 2018 capital from the previous slide. Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente, both of which are expected to close in the first quarter.
Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3x ratio. Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance in next year for capital allocation as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
I'll review all this in further detail on next slide. However, it's important to note that as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk was that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020.
Our more robust EBITDA reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to release this capital for allocation effectively 1 year earlier than previously expected, and is the reason why although we now allocated an additional $500 million towards share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous one at $2.6 billion.
Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on Slide 16. In column 1, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining 3x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to a $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $915 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018, reached to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt. 
For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales, which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effect of XOOM. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million reached the pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018.  As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization, which will only be necessary through 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which, we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio. 
Turning to 2019. As I mentioned earlier, that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve or basically 3x the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Finally, as a reminder, in 2020, we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA from margin enhancement programs, which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform, helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that, we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail. So we can actually achieve that rebalancing in 2 ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us. 
We know that the Retail space has been very active. But -- and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and hurdle rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or -- to one specific one. 
To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019, I would say that there are 3 different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders both ways, share buybacks, given the under evaluation of our stock it is today and that's a preferred one. But we also have another avenue and we are open to it, of it's dividends. And then finally, we also have to evaluate continue paying down debt. And while we are completely comfortable with 3x today, that doesn't mean that in the future it's something that we just sell it and forget it. So that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy."

So what you have is 2 different moving pieces here. What you got is a big hunk of hedges that went in that were arguably not just summer, but they were full year on peak round-the-clock kind of numbers. And you also have the lot of small numbers, which is, if you have a small number that was only summer, and then you mix that with a full year piece, which was in that second quantum was bigger than the first quantum, you're going to get a move there. Trust me, when we're selling 2020, the summers are included. So we're locking in big chunks of value."

But certainly that provides a pretty significant cushion having achieved that in 2019 to get to that 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But I don't feel at all that we're going to need to allocate additional capital to maintain the 3. As Mauricio said, we will always continue to reevaluate the 3 as we move forward. So my bias would be, if there is any additional delevering, it would be by our choice as opposed to, for lack of a better phrase, by necessity in terms of just maintaining the 3x. That makes sense?"

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our Transformation Plan performance. 
Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to rightsize our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformation of planned asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019. 
Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan. 
Moving to our third quarter business update on Slide 5. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives, while achieving top quartile safety results. I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility.
As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits, while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.
Our year-to-date results now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last 2 months. 
During the third quarter, we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.
Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our Transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019. Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.
Turning to Slide 6 with our Transformation Plan update. We continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives. We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including, expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. 
With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close South Central by year-end, as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and Carlsbad will reach COD in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is the result of having only Agua Caliente as the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time given improving market conditions.  
Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3x net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2018 after having executed our deleveraging objectives.
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at this summer. As you can see on the slide, weather was warmer than normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While load were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations. 
In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near-perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than the ones expected at the beginning of the summer. 
In the West, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restricted gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we observed that the combination of once-through cooling unit retirements and the emergence of community choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices.
In the East, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations, and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy. 
Now looking forward on Slide 8, and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT. As we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements and additional delays or cancellations of new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments. On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional generation. 
Currently, the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants. These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins, have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020. This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the cap. We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward.
One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that comes from renewable generation. As you know, this is non-dispatchable capacity and therefore, could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of generation available to serve load. 
Now moving to the East. The focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is unjust and unreasonable due to the negative impact of subsidized units. Let me reiterate that we believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market.
PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status quo and are positive for our portfolio.
Next month, it will be 3 years since I became CEO of the company. And while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record, particularly, in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our capital allocation for the past 3 years. As you may recall, we initially focused on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017. 
With the announcement of our Transformation Plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the under valuation of our own stock. 
As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental $500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide. I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call as we have done in the past. 
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale. 
Through the first 9 months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost savings target of $500 million. With these solid results and the important summer month now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance towards the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions, which I'm pleased to announce are now completed, we have now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors but makes the achievement of our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent.
As you'll recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in 2 parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets, sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer, and through an arrangement with the financial institution, effectively capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt reduction target for 2018.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR with the financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares, which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program. 
The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR, which will be completed by the end of 2018. In addition, we now have a new authorization for additional $500 million in share repurchases, which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital.
Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 12. Given the significant impact of deconsolidation resulting from asset sales in our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first to take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. 
Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018, which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago.  That consolidated guidance included the expected full year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. 
As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales, which included everything we've closed on to-date, such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM as well as our South Central business. Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect towards the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year.
That second column reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow, respectively. Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled, Previous Guidance Adjusted for Asset Sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance shown in the last column on the right.
Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales.
Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to sell to NRG Yield or Clearway in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018.
In total, these 2 items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA, included within both the Generation segment as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these 2 items will contribute to our results going forward and are thus not included in our 2019 financial guidance.
Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid-2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million, and our 2019 guidance reflects that. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 13. 2019 will be the first year since we announced the Transformation Plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses and are simplified and further strengthen the balance. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance.
Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add 2 items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of Transformation Plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019 and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement, which increases to $135 million in 2019.
Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply costs that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply costs to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019.
Next on Slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation. As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in the second quarter highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization, we have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks.
The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide and primarily consists of the following: first, as shown in Item A, based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clearway and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019. Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions I mentioned earlier as well as other liability management activities year-to-date. Finally, we've reduced the expected allocation to Transformation Plan costs to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 capital allocation, which I'll review next on Slide 15.
Turning to 2019 excess capital on Slide 15. We begin with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, plus about $70 million of unallocated 2018 capital from the previous slide. Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente, both of which are expected to close in the first quarter.
Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3x ratio. Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance next year for capital allocation as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
I'll review all this in further detail on next slide. However, it's important to note that, as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk, was that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020.
Our more robust EBITDA reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to release this capital for allocation effectively 1 year earlier than previously expected and is the reason why, although we now allocated an additional $500 million towards share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous one at $2.6 billion.
Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on Slide 16. In column 1, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining 3x net debt to EBITDA. Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which, after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $915 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018, leads to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt. 
For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales, which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effect of XOOM. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million leads to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018. As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization, which will only be necessary through 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which, we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio. 
Turning to 2019. As I mentioned earlier, that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve or basically 3x the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Finally, as a reminder, in 2020, we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA from margin enhancement programs, which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform, helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

So it's not -- I wouldn't say that is direct or -- directly correlated CDs in the Generation business. I mean, there is a lot more variable that need to be taken into consideration. So I think what I will tell you is, the benefits that we see on the Generation business tends to be 1 to 1 when power prices increase. And we have ability to pass some of that to our Retail customers, so it's not 1 to 1. That's why we say our Generation business tends to benefit more than it impacts our Retail business. But that's -- I think that's the dynamic that -- and the complementary nature of our business, and that's the level of detail that we're comfortable providing."

One is that the Retail acquisition and the other one is buyback.

Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail. So we can actually achieve that rebalancing 2 ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us. And we know that the retail space has been very active, but -- and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and hurdle rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or -- to one specific one. To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019, I would say that there are 3 different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders both ways, share buybacks, given the under valuation of our stock, it is today and that's a preferred one. But we also have another avenue and we are open to it if it's dividends. And then finally, we also have to evaluate continue paying down debt. And while we are completely comfortable with 3x today, that doesn't mean that in the future it's something that we just set it and forget it. So that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy."

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our Transformation Plan performance. 
Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to rightsize our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformation of planned asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019. 
Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan. 
Moving to our third quarter business update on Slide 5. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives, while achieving top quartile safety results. I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility.
As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits, while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.
Our year-to-date results now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last 2 months. 
During the third quarter, we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.
Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our Transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019. Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.
Turning to Slide 6 with our Transformation Plan update. We continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives. We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including, expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. 
With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close South Central by year-end, as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and Carlsbad will reach COD in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is the result of having only Agua Caliente as the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time given improving market conditions.  
Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3x net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2018 after having executed our deleveraging objectives.
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at this summer. As you can see on the slide, weather was warmer than normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While load were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations. 
In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near-perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than the ones expected at the beginning of the summer. 
In the West, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restricted gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we observed that the combination of once-through cooling unit retirements and the emergence of community choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices.
In the East, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations, and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy. 
Now looking forward on Slide 8, and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT. As we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements and additional delays or cancellations of new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments. On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional generation. 
Currently, the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants. These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins, have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020. This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the cap. We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward.
One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that comes from renewable generation. As you know, this is non-dispatchable capacity and therefore, could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of generation available to serve load. 
Now moving to the East. The focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is unjust and unreasonable due to the negative impact of subsidized units. Let me reiterate that we believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market.
PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status quo and are positive for our portfolio.
Next month, it will be 3 years since I became CEO of the company. And while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record, particularly, in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our capital allocation for the past 3 years. As you may recall, we initially focused on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017. 
With the announcement of our Transformation Plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the undervaluation of our own stock. 
As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental $500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide. I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call as we have done in the past. 
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary."

Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quart",2184,"Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale. 
Through the first 9 months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost savings target of $500 million. With these solid results and the important summer month now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance towards the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions, which I'm pleased to announce are now completed, we have now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors but makes the achievement of our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent.
As you'll recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in 2 parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets, sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer, and through an arrangement with the financial institution, effectively capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt reduction target for 2018.
As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR with the financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares, which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program. 
The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR, which will be completed by the end of 2018. In addition, we now have a new authorization for additional $500 million in share repurchases, which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital.
Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 12. Given the significant impact of deconsolidation resulting from asset sales in our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first to take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. 
Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018, which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago.  That consolidated guidance included the expected full year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. 
As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales, which included everything we've closed on to-date, such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM as well as our South Central business. Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect towards the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year.
That second column reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow, respectively. Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled, Previous Guidance Adjusted for Asset Sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance shown in the last column on the right.
Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales.
Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to sell to NRG Yield or Clearway in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018.
In total, these 2 items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA, included within both the Generation segment as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these 2 items will contribute to our results going forward and are thus not included in our 2019 financial guidance.
Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid-2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million, and our 2019 guidance reflects that. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance, which you'll find on Slide 13. 2019 will be the first year since we announced the Transformation Plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses and are simplified and further strengthen the balance. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance.
Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add 2 items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of Transformation Plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019 and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement, which increases to $135 million in 2019.
Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply costs that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply costs to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019.
Next on Slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation. As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in the second quarter highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization, we have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks.
The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide and primarily consists of the following: first, as shown in Item A, based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clearway and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019. Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions I mentioned earlier as well as other liability management activities year-to-date. Finally, we've reduced the expected allocation to Transformation Plan costs to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 capital allocation, which I'll review next on Slide 15.
Turning to 2019 excess capital on Slide 15. We begin with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, plus about $70 million of unallocated 2018 capital from the previous slide. Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente, both of which are expected to close in the first quarter.
Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3x ratio. Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance next year for capital allocation as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
I'll review all this in further detail on next slide. However, it's important to note that, as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk, was that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020.
Our more robust EBITDA reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to release this capital for allocation effectively 1 year earlier than previously expected and is the reason why, although we now allocated an additional $500 million towards share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous one at $2.6 billion.
Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on Slide 16. In column 1, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining 3x net debt to EBITDA. Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which, after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $915 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018, leads to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt. 
For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales, which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effect of XOOM. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million leads to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018. As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization, which will only be necessary through 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which, we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio. 
Turning to 2019. As I mentioned earlier, that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve or basically 3x the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Finally, as a reminder, in 2020, we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA from margin enhancement programs, which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail. So we can actually achieve that rebalancing 2 ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us. And we know that the retail space has been very active, but -- and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and hurdle rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or -- to one specific one. To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019, I would say that there are 3 different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders both ways, share buybacks, given the undervaluation of our stock, it is today and that's a preferred one. But we also have another avenue and we are open to it if it's dividends. And then finally, we also have to evaluate continue paying down debt. And while we are completely comfortable with 3x today, that doesn't mean that in the future it's something that we just set it and forget it. So that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy."

Nominally speaking, you have a significant -- a more significant increase. But thinking about -- and perhaps this is where you're going, thinking about -- ignoring the nonrecurring elements, right? When I talk about nonrecurring elements, I talk about Agua Caliente, I talk about the BETM, the Boston Energy Trading business, which still is reflected in our numbers even though it was sold intra-year. Yes, you've got about $50 million of sort of same-store outperformance, which is why I characterized it as towards the upper half of our previous range on an apples-to-apples basis, right? That was part of the reason why I unpacked that, because nominally speaking, relative to the $1.6 billion pro forma, it looks like $150 million higher. But when you adjust that for the asset sales, your number is probably the right way to think about that on a same-store basis if that makes sense at all."

I know that, obviously, you guys are not giving '20 guidance here. But just in the context of your net-debt-EBITDA targets, certainly on the '19 numbers, you're hitting those targets as the way you've laid out to us. But if this backwardation in the forward curve continues, even with the margin enhancement improvement, I mean, the sense is directionally 2020 EBITDA is slightly lower than '19. So does that figure into your calculations thinking about net debt-to-EBITDA if you would use a '20 denominator versus '19? And how you may think about capital allocation in '19 and maybe pay down more debt than you're currently showing us. Is that a fair way to think about this dynamic?"

That's $240 million of debt capacity right there. And I think we'll sort of take that as it comes going forward. But certainly, that provides a pretty significant cushion having achieved that in 2019 to get to that 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But I don't feel at all that we're going to need to allocate additional capital to maintain the 3. As Mauricio said, we will always continue to reevaluate the 3 as we move forward. So my bias would be, if there is any additional delevering, it would be by our choice as opposed to, for lack of a better phrase, by necessity in terms of just maintaining the 3x if that makes sense."

I said it on the call and I will reiterate that again. From where our stock is valued today, it does not reflect the fundamental value. And buying back our stock is still the most compelling opportunity. So this is where we're focused. And as we progress in 2019, if we see opportunities, if we see other alternatives, we always have to look at them through the prism and through the barometer of the implied returns that we have in our own stock. So we believe that we're on the right track. We have the right priorities. We're executing well. We have the right team. And I'm just very pleased where the company is going."
