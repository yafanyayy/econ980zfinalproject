Before we get started in our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. Our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic p",1040,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started in our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. 
Our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. As we continue to evolve with customers, we're combining our digital and physical assets to create new ways for them to shop. 
We invested early in our omnichannel capabilities, integrating our inventory across our stores and online over a decade ago. This has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Through these investments, we have strengthened our foundation to better serve customers and gain market share. 
Turning to our performance in 2017. We had record sales of approximately $15 billion. This represented annualized growth of 5% over the last 5 years, reflecting the investments we've made to expand our reach and improve the customer experience. We're encouraged by a number of key achievements over the past year. First, we continue to see positive customer trends. At the close of 2017, we had 33 million customers who shopped with us during the year. Additionally, 9 million customers shopped in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. It's noteworthy that customers spend nearly 70% more when shopping us through multiple touch points. 
In our Nordstrom business, we made meaningful progress in meeting customers' expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We offer a number of ways to serve them on their terms, seamlessly across stores and online. Our services such as Buy Online, Pick Up In-store, Reserve Online and Try It in Store and Style Board grew by more than 30% over last year. Nordstrom Local is a recent example of how we are testing new ways to engage and provide customers with convenient access to our service offerings. And our accelerated investments in our digital platform continue to pay off, with digital sales representing 30% of our full-priced business. 
Nordstrom.com has 700 million annual site visits, offering expanded selection in key brands and categories. Our Nordstrom Rack business continues to be our leading source of customer acquisition, gaining 6 million new customers in 2017. Over time, about 1/3 of our off-price customers cross-shop in our full-price business. In addition, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook represent our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. In 2017, it accounted for 18% of off-price sales and had new customer growth of 45%. Its integrated digital and physical experiences led to 85% of online returns being made in-store, which drove more than 4 million store trips in 2017. 
We continue to evolve and grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice. Benefits of this strategy include creating a source of newness and discovery for customers, strengthening regular-price selling and driving long-term collaborations with preferred brands. These brands, including Designer, [indiscernible] with limited distribution and our private label, delivered outsized sales growth of 14% in 2017 with healthy gross margins. Over 60% of full-price brands have limited promotional exposure, a 17 percentage point improvement from 2 years ago. 
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program continues to drive engagement while providing valuable customer insights. In May 2016, we expanded our program so that all our customers can participate regardless of how they choose to pay. We continue to reap the benefits with more than 10 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of 35% year-over-year. 
As we look ahead to 2018, we're executing on our strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. First, we're excited that we'll be opening the doors to our men's New York City store on April 12. Together with our women's store, which is slated to open in fall 2019, this flagship is our largest project to date. We expect the store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand serving as a gateway to new customers, both in the U.S. and internationally. It will be our highest-volume store in one of our top markets. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in a new market, we also expect the store to drive a material lift to online sales and market share gains. 
Second, we're focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets to deliver best-in-class services and experiences. We will bring our capabilities together across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms. We're starting our integration in L.A., our largest market, where we serve 4 million customers online and through our local assets, including 16 full-line stores, 27 Nordstrom Racks, distribution and fulfillment centers, Nordstrom Local and Trunk Club. We believe that we will gain terrific learnings from our experience in L.A. that we can apply to other markets. 
Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada, where we completed our full-line store expansion plans with our sixth store opening in Sherway Gardens, Toronto last September. This year, we're planning to open 6 Nordstrom Rack stores in the Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa areas. 
Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses and plan to grow our total Canada business to $1 billion. 
Finally, we'll continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers.  In our full-price business, our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices. 
We have made meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to better serve customers and look forward to our opportunities. We believe we have unmatched local market assets, our people, product and place, that combined with the strength of our digital capabilities, make us uniquely positioned in the market. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and thoughts about the year ahead."
32215,553089514,1408177,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventory and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecutiv",1200,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventory and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. 
We had a strong finish to the year. For 2017, total sales growth increased 4.4%, and comps increased 0.8%, which were slightly ahead of our expectations. 
In our Nordstrom brand, fourth quarter sales reflected both favorable store trends and double-digit online growth. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we had a meaningful improvement from the third quarter, a direct result of our focused efforts to provide good inventory flow and fashion right merchandise. 
Fourth quarter retail gross profit was down roughly 40 basis points from the prior year due to occupancy expenses associated with our growth plans. Merchandise margins were consistent with both our expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in our regular-priced selling. Ending inventory of 7% was in line with our plan and included a shift in timing of in-transit receipts. When normalizing for this, inventory growth was consistent with sales growth.
Our SG&A rate increased approximately 240 basis points, which included roughly 90 basis points of nonoperational items. We had a onetime contribution to our employee profit sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as legal settlement gain in 2016. The remaining increase primarily reflected planned supply chain, marketing and technology expenses. 
We reported EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year. The impacts associated with tax reform were not contemplated in our prior outlook. This consisted of a onetime charge of $0.25, primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we made an investment to employees of $0.06 mentioned earlier. Our results also included year-end adjustments to our incentives based on our top line performance, bring earnings to the lower end of our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide our perspective on how we're measuring success as our business model continues to evolve. The economics of serving customers are greatly enhanced by having combined digital and physical assets in a given market. In our full-price business, we have a high-quality portfolio of around 120 full-line stores in roughly 50 markets across the U.S. In these markets, the profit per customer is more than double that of markets without a Nordstrom store presence. This market-focused approach informs how we allocate capital, leverage our capabilities and measure our success. 
As we previously shared with you over the past several quarters, we're increasingly managing our businesses primarily through 2 brands, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, rather than by channel. This includes migrating our metrics from a legacy store view to those that are more relevant to how customers are engaging with us. We continue to further align our incentives based on markets rather than individual channels. 
Beginning in 2018, we will make a number of reporting changes and introduce additional metrics around our customer and market performance as indicators of the underlying health of our business. These changes, which are outlined in today's release, will impact our segment and sales reporting. Specifically, this means that we'll be allocating our credit business to our full-price and off-price businesses. Additionally, our sales reporting will represent a combined stores and online view and will include allocated corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns. 
As the year progresses, we will be providing clarity and transparency to help make this reporting transition go smoothly. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our path forward to achieving long-term profitable growth. We have now reached a point where our full-price digital business is at a scale in which costs to serve customers are comparable across our stores and online channels. This year, we are planning for a turning point in improved profitability as we scale our generational investments and leverage our enterprise capabilities. 
In 2017, generational investments in Canada, HauteLook and Trunk Club contributed roughly $1.5 billion in sales. As these investments continue to scale, we anticipate profit improvements. 
We accelerated investments in our foundational capabilities for supply chain, technology and marketing, resulting in an annualized expense growth of approximately 20% from 2010 to 2015 in these areas. Over the past 2 years, we have cut this growth in half through our focused effort to drive productivity and plan to further reduce it to a mid-single-digit range in 2018. 
We're planning to maintain our marketing expense as a rate to sales, focusing on personalization and scale through our data and analytics capabilities. With the speed and agility enabled by our modernized technology infrastructure, we expect to incur cash spend of $525 million towards technology, consistent with the prior year. And in supply chain, we have maintained our cost per unit with further opportunity to optimize our network. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2018 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.30 to $3.55 includes a benefit from corporate tax reform of around $0.55, partially offset by an EBIT reduction from revenue recognition changes of approximately $30 million. 
In terms of top line performance, we expect a continuation of underlying trends, yielding total sales of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and comps of 0.5% to 1.5%. This incorporates sales from generational investments of roughly $1.8 billion and 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores, 6 in the U.S. and 6 in Canada. 
Our gross profit rate assumes modest improvement in merchandise margins. Occupancy expenses as a rate to sales are expected to be relatively consistent with last year, with higher expenses in the first half due to timing of new store openings. 
Preopening expenses for our New York City flagship are estimated to be $25 million in 2018, consistent with 2017. Additionally, SG&A expense growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From an EBIT perspective, these drivers are expected to result in flat to a slight improvement in margin rate at the midpoint of our guidance. The 2017 estimated EPS impact at the 53rd week is approximately $0.05.
Our income tax rate, including state and local taxes is estimated at around 27.5%, down from 39% due to tax reform. Given the impacts related to the 53rd week, tax reform, revenue recognition and event shift, please refer to the appendix section in today's slides for additional color.
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest roughly $3.2 billion over the next 5 years or 4% of sales. Technology and supply chain are key enablers of the customer experience, representing nearly 50% of our plan. 
Canada and our New York City flagship investments making up 17% were moderate as they near completion. For 2018, net CapEx is expected to be approximately $740 million, an increase of $70 million from 2017, primarily due to our New York City flagship and the buildout of an additional West Coast fulfillment center we shifted from 2017. 
In closing, our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

We don't normally give comp or guidance, quarterly guidance, but we did try to lay out some of the event shifts with the Anniversary Sale and what some of the comp impacts are going to be first half and second half."

So when we look at what was driving the fourth quarter, as far as a modest improvement in '18, it's really 2 different pieces to it. One, as we talked about our journey for fashion authority as we continue to grow our limited distribution assortment, it has a higher margin rate for us. And so that's helping some of the improvement that we're calling out in '18. The other piece to it is Blake just referred to in discussing the Rack performance.

Before we get started on our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. 
Our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. As we continue to evolve with customers, we're combining our digital and physical assets to create new ways for them to shop. 
We invested early in our omnichannel capabilities, integrating our inventory across our stores and online over a decade ago. This has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Through these investments, we have strengthened our foundation to better serve customers and gain market share. 
Turning to our performance in 2017. We had record sales of approximately $15 billion. This represented annualized growth of 5% over the last 5 years, reflecting the investments we've made to expand our reach and improve the customer experience. We're encouraged by a number of key achievements over the past year. First, we continue to see positive customer trends. At the close of 2017, we had 33 million customers who shopped with us during the year. Additionally, 9 million customers shopped in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. It's noteworthy that customers spend nearly 70% more when shopping us through multiple touch points. 
In our Nordstrom business, we made meaningful progress in meeting customers' expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We offer a number of ways to serve them on their terms, seamlessly across stores and online. Our services such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, Reserve Online and Try It in Store and Style Board grew by more than 30% over last year. Nordstrom Local is a recent example of how we are testing new ways to engage and provide customers with convenient access to our service offerings. And our accelerated investments in our digital platform continue to pay off, with digital sales representing 30% of our full-priced business. 
Nordstrom.com has 700 million annual site visits, offering expanded selection in key brands and categories. Our Nordstrom Rack business continues to be our leading source of customer acquisition, getting 6 million new customers in 2017. Over time, about 1/3 of our off-price customers cross-shop in our full-price business. In addition, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook represent our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. In 2017, it accounted for 18% of off-price sales and had new customer growth of 45%. Its integrated digital and physical experiences led to 85% of online returns being made in store, which drove more than 4 million store trips in 2017. 
We continue to evolve and grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice. Benefits of this strategy include creating a source of newness and discovery for customers, strengthening regular-price selling and driving long-term collaborations with preferred brands. These brands, including Designer, [indiscernible] limited distribution and our private label, delivered outsized sales growth of 14% in 2017 with healthy gross margins. Over 60% of full-price brands have limited promotional exposure, a 17 percentage point improvement from 2 years ago. 
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program continues to drive engagement while providing valuable customer insights. In May 2016, we expanded our program so that all our customers can participate regardless of how they choose to pay. We continue to reap the benefits with more than 10 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of 35% year-over-year. 
As we look ahead to 2018, we're executing on our strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. First, we're excited that we'll be opening the doors to our men's New York City store on April 12. Together with our women's store, which is slated to open in fall 2019, this flagship is our largest project to date. We expect the store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand serving as a gateway to new customers, both in the U.S. and internationally. It will be our highest-volume store in one of our top markets. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in a new market, we also expect the store to drive a material lift to online sales and market share gains. 
Second, we're focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets to deliver best-in-class services and experiences. We will bring our capabilities together across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms. We're starting our integration in L.A., our largest market, where we serve 4 million customers online and through our local assets, including 16 full-line stores, 27 Nordstrom Racks, distribution and fulfillment centers, Nordstrom Local and Trunk Club. We believe that we will gain terrific learnings from our experience in L.A. that we can apply to other markets. 
Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada, where we completed our full-line store expansion plans with our sixth store opening in Sherway Gardens, Toronto last September. This year, we're planning to open 6 Nordstrom Rack stores in the Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa areas. 
Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses and plan to grow our total Canada business to $1 billion. 
Finally, we'll continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers. In our full-price business, our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices. 
We have made meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to better serve customers and look forward to our opportunities. We believe we have unmatched local market assets, our people, product and place, that combined with the strength of our digital capabilities, make us uniquely positioned in the market. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and thoughts about the year ahead."

Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. 
We had a strong finish to the year. For 2017, total sales growth increased 4.4%, and comps increased 0.8%, which were slightly ahead of our expectations. 
In our Nordstrom brand, fourth quarter sales reflected both favorable store trends and double-digit online growth. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we had a meaningful improvement from the third quarter, a direct result of our focused efforts to provide good inventory flow and fashion right merchandise. 
Fourth quarter retail gross profit was down roughly 40 basis points from the prior year due to occupancy expenses associated with our growth plans. Merchandise margins were consistent with both our expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in our regular-priced selling. Ending inventory of 7% was in line with our plan and included a shift in timing of in-transit receipts. When normalizing for this, inventory growth was consistent with sales growth.
Our SG&A rate increased approximately 240 basis points, which included roughly 90 basis points of nonoperational items. We had a onetime contribution to our employee profit sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as legal settlement gain in 2016. The remaining increase primarily reflected planned supply chain, marketing and technology expenses. 
We reported EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year. The impacts associated with tax reform were not contemplated in our prior outlook. This consisted of a onetime charge of $0.25, primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we made an investment to employees of $0.06 mentioned earlier. Our results also included year-end adjustments to our incentives based on our top line performance, bringing earnings to the lower end of our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide our perspective on how we're measuring success as our business model continues to evolve. The economics of serving customers are greatly enhanced by having combined digital and physical assets in a given market. In our full-price business, we have a high-quality portfolio of around 120 full-line stores in roughly 50 markets across the U.S. In these markets, the profit per customer is more than double that of markets without a Nordstrom store presence. This market-focused approach informs how we allocate capital, leverage our capabilities and measure our success. 
As we previously shared over the past several quarters, we're increasingly managing our businesses primarily through 2 brands, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, rather than by channel. This includes migrating our metrics from a legacy store view to those that are more relevant to how customers are engaging with us. We continue to further align our incentives based on markets rather than individual channels. 
Beginning in 2018, we will make a number of reporting changes and introduce additional metrics around our customer and market performance as indicators of the underlying health of our business. These changes, which are outlined in today's release, will impact our segment and sales reporting. Specifically, this means that we'll be allocating our credit business to our full-price and off-price businesses. Additionally, our sales reporting will represent a combined stores and online view and will include allocated corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns. As the year progresses, we will be providing clarity and transparency to help make this reporting transition go smoothly. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our path forward to achieving long-term profitable growth. We have now reached a point where our full-price digital business is at a scale in which costs to serve customers are comparable across our stores and online channels. This year, we are planning for a turning point in improved profitability as we scale our generational investments and leverage our enterprise capabilities. 
In 2017, generational investments in Canada, HauteLook and Trunk Club contributed roughly $1.5 billion in sales. As these investments continue to scale, we anticipate profit improvements. 
We accelerated investments in our foundational capabilities for supply chain, technology and marketing, resulting in an annualized expense growth of approximately 20% from 2010 to 2015 in these areas. Over the past 2 years, we have cut this growth in half through our focused effort to drive productivity and plan to further reduce it to a mid-single-digit range in 2018. 
We're planning to maintain our marketing expense as a rate to sales, focusing on personalization and scale through our data and analytics capabilities. With the speed and agility enabled by our modernized technology infrastructure, we expect to incur cash spend of $525 million towards technology, consistent with the prior year. And in supply chain, we have maintained our cost per unit with further opportunity to optimize our network. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2018 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.30 to $3.55 includes a benefit from corporate tax reform of around $0.55, partially offset by an EBIT reduction from revenue recognition changes of approximately $30 million. 
In terms of top line performance, we expect a continuation of underlying trends, yielding total sales of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and comps of 0.5% to 1.5%. This incorporates sales from generational investments of roughly $1.8 billion and 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores, 6 in the U.S. and 6 in Canada. 
Our gross profit rate assumes modest improvement in merchandise margins. Occupancy expenses as a rate to sales are expected to be relatively consistent with last year, with higher expenses in the first half due to timing of new store openings. 
Preopening expenses for our New York City flagship are estimated to be $25 million in 2018, consistent with 2017. Additionally, SG&A expense growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From an EBIT perspective, these drivers are expected to result in flat to a slight improvement in margin rate at the midpoint of our guidance. The 2017 estimated EPS impact at the 53rd week is approximately $0.05.
Our income tax rate, including state and local taxes is estimated at around 27.5%, down from 39% due to tax reform. Given the impacts related to the 53rd week, tax reform, revenue recognition and event shift, please refer to the appendix section in today's slides for additional color.
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest roughly $3.2 billion over the next 5 years or 4% of sales. Technology and supply chain are key enablers of the customer experience, representing nearly 50% of our plan. 
Canada and our New York City flagship investments, making up 17%, were moderate as they near completion. For 2018, net CapEx is expected to be approximately $740 million, an increase of $70 million from 2017, primarily due to our New York City flagship and the buildout of an additional West Coast fulfillment center we shifted from 2017. 
In closing, our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

Both full-price and off-price, that was very solid inventory management. The aging of it is good. We think we're in a very good position to achieve the goals we've laid out for this year."

And really, the big headwinds were in our occupancy expenses with some of the preopening costs we've had in Canada with the Rack stores as well as New York City. So when we look at it, those were really what was driving the fourth quarter. As far as a modest improvement in '18, it's really 2 different pieces to it. One, as we talked about our journey for fashion authority as we continue to grow our limited distribution assortment, it has a higher margin rate for us. And so that's helping some of the improvement that we're calling out in '18. The other piece to it is Blake just referred to in discussing the Rack performance. We expect to see some improvement in that area as well as we start the year in a better inventory position as well as having a pretty disciplined look on our buy."

Before we get started on our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. 
Our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. As we continue to evolve with customers, we're combining our digital and physical assets to create new ways for them to shop. 
We invested early in our omnichannel capabilities, integrating our inventory across our stores and online over a decade ago. This has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Through these investments, we have strengthened our foundation to better serve customers and gain market share. 
Turning to our performance in 2017. We had record sales of approximately $15 billion. This represented annualized growth of 5% over the last 5 years, reflecting the investments we've made to expand our reach and improve the customer experience. We're encouraged by a number of key achievements over the past year. First, we continue to see positive customer trends. At the close of 2017, we had 33 million customers who shopped with us during the year. Additionally, 9 million customers shopped in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. It's noteworthy that customers spend nearly 70% more when shopping us through multiple touch points. 
In our Nordstrom business, we made meaningful progress in meeting customers' expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We offer a number of ways to serve them on their terms, seamlessly across stores and online. Our services such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, Reserve Online and Try It in Store and Style Board grew by more than 30% over last year. Nordstrom Local is a recent example of how we are testing new ways to engage and provide customers with convenient access to our service offerings. And our accelerated investments in our digital platform continue to pay off, with digital sales representing 30% of our full-priced business. 
Nordstrom.com has 700 million annual site visits, offering expanded selection in key brands and categories. Our Nordstrom Rack business continues to be our leading source of customer acquisition, getting 6 million new customers in 2017. Over time, about 1/3 of our off-price customers cross-shop in our full-price business. In addition, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook represent our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. In 2017, it accounted for 18% of off-price sales and had new customer growth of 45%. Its integrated digital and physical experiences led to 85% of online returns being made in store, which drove more than 4 million store trips in 2017. 
We continue to evolve and grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice. Benefits of this strategy include creating a source of newness and discovery for customers, strengthening regular-price selling and driving long-term collaborations with preferred brands. These brands, including Designer, product with limited distribution and our private label, delivered outsized sales growth of 14% in 2017 with healthy gross margins. Over 60% of full-price brands have limited promotional exposure, a 17 percentage point improvement from 2 years ago. 
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program continues to drive engagement while providing valuable customer insights. In May 2016, we expanded our program so that all our customers can participate regardless of how they choose to pay. We continue to reap the benefits with more than 10 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of 35% year-over-year. 
As we look ahead to 2018, we're executing on our strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. First, we're excited that we'll be opening the doors to our men's New York City store on April 12. Together with our women's store, which is slated to open in fall 2019, this flagship is our largest project to date. We expect the store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand serving as a gateway to new customers, both in the U.S. and internationally. It will be our highest-volume store in one of our top markets. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in a new market, we also expect the store to drive a material lift to online sales and market share gains. 
Second, we're focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets to deliver best-in-class services and experiences. We will bring our capabilities together across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms. We're starting our integration in L.A., our largest market, where we serve 4 million customers online and through our local assets, including 16 full-line stores, 27 Nordstrom Racks, distribution and fulfillment centers, Nordstrom Local and Trunk Club. We believe that we will gain terrific learnings from our experience in L.A. that we can apply to other markets. 
Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada, where we completed our full-line store expansion plans with our sixth store opening in Sherway Gardens, Toronto last September. This year, we're planning to open 6 Nordstrom Rack stores in the Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa areas. 
Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses and plan to grow our total Canada business to $1 billion. 
Finally, we'll continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers. In our full-price business, our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices. 
We have made meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to better serve customers and look forward to our opportunities. We believe we have unmatched local market assets, our people, product and place, that combined with the strength of our digital capabilities, make us uniquely positioned in the market. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and thoughts about the year ahead."
32215,553089514,1408801,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecut",1198,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. 
We had a strong finish to the year. For 2017, total sales growth increased 4.4%, and comps increased 0.8%, which were slightly ahead of our expectations. 
In our Nordstrom brand, fourth quarter sales reflected both favorable store trends and double-digit online growth. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we had a meaningful improvement from the third quarter, a direct result of our focused efforts to provide good inventory flow and fashion right merchandise. 
Fourth quarter retail gross profit was down roughly 40 basis points from the prior year due to occupancy expenses associated with our growth plans. Merchandise margins were consistent with both our expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in our regular-priced selling. Ending inventory of 7% was in line with our plan and included a shift in timing of in-transit receipts. When normalizing for this, inventory growth was consistent with sales growth.
Our SG&A rate increased approximately 240 basis points, which included roughly 90 basis points of nonoperational items. We had a onetime contribution to our employee profit sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as legal settlement gain in 2016. The remaining increase primarily reflected planned supply chain, marketing and technology expenses. 
We reported EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year. The impacts associated with tax reform were not contemplated in our prior outlook. This consisted of a onetime charge of $0.25, primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we made an investment to employees of $0.06 mentioned earlier. Our results also included year-end adjustments to our incentives based on our top line performance, bringing earnings to the lower end of our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide our perspective on how we're measuring success as our business model continues to evolve. The economics of serving customers are greatly enhanced by having combined digital and physical assets in a given market. In our full-price business, we have a high-quality portfolio of around 120 full-line stores in roughly 50 markets across the U.S. In these markets, the profit per customer is more than double that of markets without a Nordstrom store presence. This market-focused approach informs how we allocate capital, leverage our capabilities and measure our success. 
As we previously shared over the past several quarters, we're increasingly managing our businesses primarily through 2 brands, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, rather than by channel. This includes migrating our metrics from a legacy store view to those that are more relevant to how customers are engaging with us. We continue to further align our incentives based on markets rather than individual channels. 
Beginning in 2018, we will make a number of reporting changes and introduce additional metrics around our customer and market performance as indicators of the underlying health of our business. These changes, which are outlined in today's release, will impact our segment and sales reporting. Specifically, this means that we'll be allocating our credit business to our full-price and off-price businesses. Additionally, our sales reporting will represent a combined stores and online view and will include allocated corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns. As the year progresses, we will be providing clarity and transparency to help make this reporting transition go smoothly. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our path forward to achieving long-term profitable growth. We have now reached a point where our full-price digital business is at a scale in which costs to serve customers are comparable across our stores and online channels. This year, we are planning for a turning point in improved profitability as we scale our generational investments and leverage our enterprise capabilities. 
In 2017, generational investments in Canada, HauteLook and Trunk Club contributed roughly $1.5 billion in sales. As these investments continue to scale, we anticipate profit improvements. 
We accelerated investments in our foundational capabilities for supply chain, technology and marketing, resulting in an annualized expense growth of approximately 20% from 2010 to 2015 in these areas. Over the past 2 years, we have cut this growth in half through our focused effort to drive productivity and plan to further reduce it to a mid-single-digit range in 2018. 
We're planning to maintain our marketing expense as a rate to sales, focusing on personalization and scale through our data and analytics capabilities. With the speed and agility enabled by our modernized technology infrastructure, we expect to incur cash spend of $525 million towards technology, consistent with the prior year. And in supply chain, we have maintained our cost per unit with further opportunity to optimize our network. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2018 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.30 to $3.55 includes a benefit from corporate tax reform of around $0.55, partially offset by an EBIT reduction from revenue recognition changes of approximately $30 million. 
In terms of top line performance, we expect a continuation of underlying trends, yielding total sales of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and comps of 0.5% to 1.5%. This incorporates sales from generational investments of roughly $1.8 billion and 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores, 6 in the U.S. and 6 in Canada. 
Our gross profit rate assumes modest improvement in merchandise margins. Occupancy expenses as a rate to sales are expected to be relatively consistent with last year, with higher expenses in the first half due to timing of new store openings. 
Preopening expenses for our New York City flagship are estimated to be $25 million in 2018, consistent with 2017. Additionally, SG&A expense growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From an EBIT perspective, these drivers are expected to result in flat to a slight improvement in margin rate at the midpoint of our guidance. The 2017 estimated EPS impact at the 53rd week is approximately $0.05.
Our income tax rate, including state and local taxes is estimated at around 27.5%, down from 39% due to tax reform. Given the impacts related to the 53rd week, tax reform, revenue recognition and event shift, please refer to the appendix section in today's slides for additional color.
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest roughly $3.2 billion over the next 5 years or 4% of sales. Technology and supply chain are key enablers of the customer experience, representing nearly 50% of our plan. 
Canada and our New York City flagship investments, making up 17%, will moderate as they near completion. For 2018, net CapEx is expected to be approximately $740 million, an increase of $70 million from 2017, primarily due to our New York City flagship and the buildout of an additional West Coast fulfillment center we shifted from 2017. 
In closing, our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

It's -- we're not looking to have commercialized exclusive for the sake of exclusivity. We're looking to have the most current, relevant, sought-after brands. And we believe in brands that's out there. So we think the appropriate thing, given the changing dynamics in our industry, is to have more strategic partnerships with brands that are not widely, widely distributed. So that's been very successful from both a sales growth standpoint and a gross margin standpoint. And we do plan on growing our strategic brand business at a faster rate than our overall business."

Before we get started on our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer.

Before we get started on our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. 
Our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. As we continue to evolve with customers, we're combining our digital and physical assets to create new ways for them to shop. 
We invested early in our omnichannel capabilities, integrating our inventory across our stores and online over a decade ago. This has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Through these investments, we have strengthened our foundation to better serve customers and gain market share. 
Turning to our performance in 2017. We had record sales of approximately $15 billion. This represented annualized growth of 5% over the last 5 years, reflecting the investments we've made to expand our reach and improve the customer experience. We're encouraged by a number of key achievements over the past year. First, we continue to see positive customer trends. At the close of 2017, we had 33 million customers who shopped with us during the year. Additionally, 9 million customers shopped in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. It's noteworthy that customers spend nearly 70% more when shopping us through multiple touch points. 
In our Nordstrom business, we made meaningful progress in meeting customers' expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We offer a number of ways to serve them on their terms, seamlessly across stores and online. Our services such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, Reserve Online and Try It in Store and Style Board grew by more than 30% over last year. Nordstrom Local is a recent example of how we are testing new ways to engage and provide customers with convenient access to our service offerings. And our accelerated investments in our digital platform continue to pay off, with digital sales representing 30% of our full-priced business. 
Nordstrom.com has 700 million annual site visits, offering expanded selection in key brands and categories. Our Nordstrom Rack business continues to be our leading source of customer acquisition, getting 6 million new customers in 2017. Over time, about 1/3 of our off-price customers cross-shop in our full-price business. In addition, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook represent our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. In 2017, it accounted for 18% of off-price sales and had new customer growth of 45%. Its integrated digital and physical experiences led to 85% of online returns being made in store, which drove more than 4 million store trips in 2017. 
We continue to evolve and grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice. Benefits of this strategy include creating a source of newness and discovery for customers, strengthening regular-price selling and driving long-term collaborations with preferred brands. These brands, including Designer, product with limited distribution and our private label, delivered outsized sales growth of 14% in 2017 with healthy gross margins. Over 60% of full-price brands have limited promotional exposure, a 17 percentage point improvement from 2 years ago. 
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program continues to drive engagement while providing valuable customer insights. In May 2016, we expanded our program so that all our customers can participate regardless of how they choose to pay. We continue to reap the benefits with more than 10 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of 35% year-over-year. 
As we look ahead to 2018, we're executing on our strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. First, we're excited that we'll be opening the doors to our men's New York City store on April 12. Together with our women's store, which is slated to open in fall 2019, this flagship is our largest project to date. We expect the store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand serving as a gateway to new customers, both in the U.S. and internationally. It will be our highest-volume store in one of our top markets. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in a new market, we also expect the store to drive a material lift to online sales and market share gains. 
Second, we're focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets to deliver best-in-class services and experiences. We will bring our capabilities together across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms. We're starting our integration in L.A., our largest market, where we serve 4 million customers online and through our local assets, including 16 full-line stores, 27 Nordstrom Racks, distribution and fulfillment centers, Nordstrom Local and Trunk Club. We believe that we will gain terrific learnings from our experience in L.A. that we can apply to other markets. 
Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada, where we completed our full-line store expansion plans with our sixth store opening in Sherway Gardens, Toronto last September. This year, we're planning to open 6 Nordstrom Rack stores in the Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa areas. 
Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses and plan to grow our total Canada business to $1 billion. 
Finally, we'll continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers. In our full-price business, our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices. 
We have made meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to better serve customers and look forward to our opportunities. We believe we have unmatched local market assets, our people, product and place, that combined with the strength of our digital capabilities, make us uniquely positioned in the market. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and thoughts about the year ahead."

Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins.

Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution, ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position, marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. 
We had a strong finish to the year. For 2017, total sales growth increased 4.4%, and comps increased 0.8%, which were slightly ahead of our expectations. 
In our Nordstrom brand, fourth quarter sales reflected both favorable store trends and double-digit online growth. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we had a meaningful improvement from the third quarter, a direct result of our focused efforts to provide good inventory flow and fashion right merchandise. 
Fourth quarter retail gross profit was down roughly 40 basis points from the prior year due to occupancy expenses associated with our growth plans. Merchandise margins were consistent with both our expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in our regular-priced selling. Ending inventory of 7% was in line with our plan and included a shift in timing of in-transit receipts. When normalizing for this, inventory growth was consistent with sales growth.
Our SG&A rate increased approximately 240 basis points, which included roughly 90 basis points of nonoperational items. We had a onetime contribution to our employee profit sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as legal settlement gain in 2016. The remaining increase primarily reflected planned supply chain, marketing and technology expenses. 
We reported EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year. The impacts associated with tax reform were not contemplated in our prior outlook. This consisted of a onetime charge of $0.25, primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we made an investment to employees of $0.06 mentioned earlier. Our results also included year-end adjustments to our incentives based on our top line performance, bringing earnings to the lower end of our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide our perspective on how we're measuring success as our business model continues to evolve. The economics of serving customers are greatly enhanced by having combined digital and physical assets in a given market. In our full-price business, we have a high-quality portfolio of around 120 full-line stores in roughly 50 markets across the U.S. In these markets, the profit per customer is more than double that of markets without a Nordstrom store presence. This market-focused approach informs how we allocate capital, leverage our capabilities and measure our success. 
As we previously shared over the past several quarters, we're increasingly managing our businesses primarily through 2 brands, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, rather than by channel. This includes migrating our metrics from a legacy store view to those that are more relevant to how customers are engaging with us. We continue to further align our incentives based on markets rather than individual channels. 
Beginning in 2018, we will make a number of reporting changes and introduce additional metrics around our customer and market performance as indicators of the underlying health of our business. These changes, which are outlined in today's release, will impact our segment and sales reporting. Specifically, this means that we'll be allocating our credit business to our full-price and off-price businesses. Additionally, our sales reporting will represent a combined stores and online view and will include allocated corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns. As the year progresses, we will be providing clarity and transparency to help make this reporting transition go smoothly. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our path forward to achieving long-term profitable growth. We have now reached a point where our full-price digital business is at a scale in which costs to serve customers are comparable across our stores and online channels. This year, we are planning for a turning point in improved profitability as we scale our generational investments and leverage our enterprise capabilities. 
In 2017, generational investments in Canada, HauteLook and Trunk Club contributed roughly $1.5 billion in sales. As these investments continue to scale, we anticipate profit improvements. 
We accelerated investments in our foundational capabilities for supply chain, technology and marketing, resulting in an annualized expense growth of approximately 20% from 2010 to 2015 in these areas. Over the past 2 years, we have cut this growth in half through our focused effort to drive productivity and plan to further reduce it to a mid-single-digit range in 2018. 
We're planning to maintain our marketing expense as a rate to sales, focusing on personalization and scale through our data and analytics capabilities. With the speed and agility enabled by our modernized technology infrastructure, we expect to incur cash spend of $525 million towards technology, consistent with the prior year. And in supply chain, we have maintained our cost per unit with further opportunity to optimize our network. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2018 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.30 to $3.55 includes a benefit from corporate tax reform of around $0.55, partially offset by an EBIT reduction from revenue recognition changes of approximately $30 million. 
In terms of top line performance, we expect a continuation of underlying trends, yielding total sales of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and comps of 0.5% to 1.5%. This incorporates sales from generational investments of roughly $1.8 billion and 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores, 6 in the U.S. and 6 in Canada. 
Our gross profit rate assumes modest improvement in merchandise margins. Occupancy expenses as a rate to sales are expected to be relatively consistent with last year, with higher expenses in the first half due to timing of new store openings. 
Preopening expenses for our New York City flagship are estimated to be $25 million in 2018, consistent with 2017. Additionally, SG&A expense growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From an EBIT perspective, these drivers are expected to result in flat to a slight improvement in margin rate at the midpoint of our guidance. The 2017 estimated EPS impact at the 53rd week is approximately $0.05.
Our income tax rate, including state and local taxes is estimated at around 27.5%, down from 39% due to tax reform. Given the impacts related to the 53rd week, tax reform, revenue recognition and event shift, please refer to the appendix section in today's slides for additional color.
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest roughly $3.2 billion over the next 5 years or 4% of sales. Technology and supply chain are key enablers of the customer experience, representing nearly 50% of our plan. 
Canada and our New York City flagship investments, making up 17%, will moderate as they near completion. For 2018, net CapEx is expected to be approximately $740 million, an increase of $70 million from 2017, primarily due to our New York City flagship and the buildout of an additional West Coast fulfillment center we shifted from 2017. 
In closing, our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

And then as far as the top line comp performance, there is a slide in the appendix of the deck that we gave you guys.

So when we look at it, those were really what was driving the fourth quarter. As far as a modest improvement in '18, it's really 2 different pieces to it. One, as we talked about our journey for fashion authority as we continue to grow our limited distribution assortment, it has a higher margin rate for us.

Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations",661,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations. We delivered total sales growth of 5.8%. This included an increase of around 250 basis points, primarily from a loyalty event shift. Comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, increased 0.6%. 
The investments we're making in digital continue to pay off. During the quarter, we generated an 18% increase in sales, enabled through our digital capabilities, compared to the previous year. Our full-priced comp sales increase of 0.7% was generally consistent with our trends. Our off-price comp sales increased 0.4%. While we're not satisfied with recent trends in our stores, we're focused on making improvements to our Rack business. 
On April 12, we achieved a significant milestone in our company's history with the opening of our first ever full-line Men's Store in New York City located near Columbus Circle. This 3-level, 47,000-square-foot store features our latest service experiences to help serve customers on their turns, including express returns kiosk, same-day delivery, 24x7 buy online and pick up in store and unique brand partnerships. Our Men's Store opened ahead of our New York City flagship, which is scheduled for fall of 2019, and we're off to a good start. Manhattan is a premier retail destination and represents our largest online market serving customers. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in new markets, we also expect this flagship to deliver a meaningful sales lift in New York City. 
This quarter marked another important achievement with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada. Like our experience in the U.S., we expect synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. We're seeing terrific results from or 3-store openings this spring in the Toronto and Calgary markets, with 3 more openings planned for this fall. 
We continue to grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice for brands and providing customers with newness. We want to create a sense of discovery through these collaborations while supporting our regular-price sell-in. Our strategic brands include new and emerging partners, along with established ones. 
During the time of transformation in the industry, we've been investing in digital capabilities to expand our customer reach and engagement. This uniquely positions us to increase market share and drive growth. Our customer-focused approach informs how we allocate capital with the goal of driving customer engagement, market share gains and improved profitability. 
In our top markets, we're further integrating our digital and physical assets across supply chain, technology, marketing and merchandising to deliver differentiated services and experiences. To lead our efforts, we recently named [ Ken Marcel ] as our Chief Digital Officer. As one of our top leaders, Ken is instrumental in driving our digital strategy as we continue to evolve our business. He will also continue in his role as President of Nordstrom.com. 
This year, we're launching efforts to link our capabilities in our largest market, Los Angeles, and recently kicked off our efforts with a group of highly engaged customers to co-create unique customer shopping journeys. We intend to apply our learnings from L.A. to quickly scale to other markets. 
We continue to see positive trends in customer metrics, which are an important way we measure our progress in gaining new customers and increasing engagement with existing ones. The growth in active customers and customer shopping across multiple channels continues to outpace sales growth, which helps contribute to market share gains. 
As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook for the year."
32215,562146877,1469530,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues c",658,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues came in better than expected, the result of our recent efforts to drive new account growth.
In full-price, our core U.S. business had stabilized trends. Also, Trunk Club showed significant improvement. In off-price, sales were slightly below our plan, reflecting outside digital growth, offset by Nordstrom Rack stores' performance. As Blake mentioned, we expect improvements throughout the year.
Turning to gross profit. Our rate was down approximately 20 basis points relative to last year. This was due to higher occupancy related to U.S. and Canada Rack openings, in addition, the planned preopening expenses associated with the New York Men's Store. Merchandise margins were in line with expectations in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in regular-priced selling trends. We exited the quarter in good inventory position, with sales growth exceeding a 2% decline in inventory. 
Our SG&A rate was roughly 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to preopening expenses for the New York Men's Store. Our SG&A rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends as we continue to benefit from productivity gains in marketing, technology and supply chain.
Next, I'd like to provide further insights on our path forward. As we shared in last quarter's call, we expect 2018 to be an inflection point from improved profitability based on the following drivers: We've made generational investments in Canada and Manhattan and through our acquisitions of HauteLook and Trunk Club. We anticipate operating improvements as these businesses scale. We're also benefiting from productivity gains as a result of foundational investments in our capabilities. We expect ongoing opportunities from improved expense leverage, particularly in marketing and technology. In supply chain, we continue to invest in creating end-to-end value and improving the customer experience.
Our strategic brand partnerships represent another lever that enables us to provide a compelling product offering and strengthen our regular-price selling. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to remind you of our capital allocation principles. First and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in the business to create long-term shareholder value. Over the next 5 years, our CapEx plan of $3.2 billion or 4% of sales supports investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. In addition, we seek to return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and resumed share repurchase activity. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed the EPS range to $3.35 to $3.55, raising the low end to incorporate our first quarter performance. Our first year sales outlook remains unchanged, reflecting a comp sales increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our updated EBIT outlook assumes current credit revenue trends at a mid-teens growth rate.
As a reminder, our outlook includes the following sales timing considerations: While comp sales will be reported on a like-for-like basis, total sales will be impacted by shift from the Anniversary Sale. Additionally, revenue recognition is not expected to materially impact full year sales, but there will be associated impacts related to the anniversary event shift. These 2 combined factors are estimated to create a timing impact to total sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in Q2 and Q3. Please refer to our appendix for further color.
Finally, before we turn to Q&A, lead like to announce our plan to host an investor event on July 10. This will give us an opportunity to provide further insights into our customer strategy, our position for the future and drivers of long-term value creation.

We haven't been calling from Los Angeles right now where we've been doing business for 4 years. Some of these stores, we opened in centers that were once better than they are now, and we've got some stores that are in centers are getting better than ever. And so there's a lot to go then how we look at it. It's about investing in existing stores. We have a number of stores that we've made big investments in of last years and have plans to continue to invest in our best stores. And in addition to that, we have a store that might to be the fifth or sixth store in the market that we opened when that make a lot of more sense, I think, 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago. And you've seen us close some of those stores.

These are very productive stores, and we're very pleased to have a great, robust online business as well. It was just shy of $1 billion last year. So we are in earlier days of trying to understand, as Erik talked about earlier and Jamie, about looking at the customer's point of view and how we can best serve them, both the physical bricks-and-mortar and also digitally. So we're strategic and opportunistic in terms of new store growth. We don't have a set number. Again, we're about 240. We're opening 6 in Canada this year. We have 6 stores in the U.S. and a relocation. We have 4 slated for 2019. So it's not a set number. It has to meet our criteria. These are all strong stores. So we're not looking to close stores in that. But we do think, in general, that we have a very strong base with that strong digital base to best serve the customer. Your second question was regarding Women's, and you asked about the weather or the seasonal part that I mentioned and were there any other execution issues. Yes, there was. But I think the most material was some bets that we made in some areas that were more seasonally related than, in Q1 at least, didn't play out as well, and the customer voted. The other question was were there any other businesses or merchandise areas within the Rack that missed plan. No, I would say, predominantly, the other merchandise areas met or slightly exceeded their plans against the Women's and such a large part of the business. It had an impact on it. But across the board, we see lots of opportunities, and that's what we're getting after. We have a number of test to work on right now. This is a business that's pretty nimble and agile. And so we can take those learnings and the feedback we get from our people and the customer, apply it, and literally, within 30 days, get some feedback and make some adjustments. And the fact that our inventories are in line, it's a real strength for us."

But in general, we do like -- we have a fairly conservative balance sheet. We do want to be investment-grade, and we do take a look at where is the best return on our investments. So first investing in the company and driving shareholder value that way and looking at the best way to return cash to shareholders, whether it's dividends or share buybacks. We do take a look at share buyback as a return to metric, and we are a little opportunistic as we see the price maybe getting out of bounds we think intrinsic value of the company will go opportunistic in that manner. So and from an M&A perspective, again, we've got a flexible balance sheet. So again, we're looking at what's the best right investments in the long-term return for the shareholders.

Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations",662,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations. We delivered total sales growth of 5.8%. This included an increase of around 250 basis points, primarily from a loyalty event shift. Comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, increased 0.6%. 
The investments we're making in digital continue to pay off. During the quarter, we generated an 18% increase in sales, enabled through our digital capabilities, compared to the previous year. Our full-price comp sales increase of 0.7% was generally consistent with our trends. Our off-price comp sales increased 0.4%. While we're not satisfied with recent trends in our stores, we're focused on making improvements to our Rack business. 
On April 12, we achieved a significant milestone in our company's history with the opening of our first ever full-line Men's Store in New York City located near Columbus Circle. This 3-level, 47,000-square-foot store features our latest service experiences to help serve customers on their terms, including express returns kiosk, same-day delivery, 24x7 buy online and pick up in store and unique brand partnerships. Our Men's Store opened ahead of our New York City flagship, which is scheduled for fall of 2019, and we're off to a good start. Manhattan is a premier retail destination and represents our largest online market serving customers. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in new markets, we also expect this flagship to deliver a meaningful sales lift in New York City. 
This quarter marked another important achievement with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada. Like our experience in the U.S., we expect synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. We're seeing terrific results from our 3 store openings this spring in the Toronto and Calgary markets, with 3 more openings planned for this fall. 
We continue to grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice for brands and providing customers with newness. We want to create a sense of discovery through these collaborations, while supporting our regular price sell-in. Our strategic brands include new and emerging partners, along with established ones. 
During the time of transformation in the industry, we've been investing in digital capabilities to expand our customer reach and engagement. This uniquely positions us to increase market share and drive growth. Our customer-focused approach informs how we allocate capital with the goal of driving customer engagement, market share gains and improved profitability. 
In our top markets, we're further integrating our digital and physical assets across supply chain, technology, marketing and merchandising to deliver differentiated services and experiences. To lead our efforts, we recently named Ken Marcel Worzel as our Chief Digital Officer. As one of our top leaders, Ken is instrumental in driving our digital strategy as we continue to evolve our business. He will also continue in his role as President of Nordstrom.com. 
This year, we're launching efforts to link our capabilities in our largest market, Los Angeles, and recently kicked off our efforts with a group of highly engaged customers to co-create unique customer shopping journeys. We intend to apply our learnings from L.A. to quickly scale to other markets. 
We continue to see positive trends in customer metrics, which are an important way we measure our progress in gaining new customers and increasing engagement with existing ones. The growth in active customers and customer shopping across multiple channels continues to outpace sales growth, which helps contribute to market share gains. 
As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars, providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook for the year."
32215,562146877,1469630,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues c",658,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues came in better than expected, the result of our recent efforts to drive new account growth.
In full-price, our core U.S. business had stabilized trends. Also, Trunk Club showed significant improvement. In off-price, sales were slightly below our plan, reflecting outsized digital growth, offset by Nordstrom Rack stores' performance. As Blake mentioned, we expect improvements throughout the year.
Turning to gross profit. Our rate was down approximately 20 basis points relative to last year. This was due to higher occupancy related to U.S. and Canada Rack openings, in addition to planned preopening expenses associated with the New York Men's Store. Merchandise margins were in line with expectations in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in regular-priced selling trends. We exited the quarter in good inventory position, with sales growth exceeding a 2% decline in inventory. 
Our SG&A rate was roughly 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to preopening expenses for the New York Men's store. Our SG&A rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends as we continue to benefit from productivity gains in marketing, technology and supply chain.
Next, I'd like to provide further insights on our path forward. As we shared in last quarter's call, we expect 2018 to be an inflection point for improved profitability based on the following drivers: We've made generational investments in Canada and Manhattan and through our acquisitions of HauteLook and Trunk Club. We anticipate operating improvements as these businesses scale. We're also benefiting from productivity gains as a result of foundational investments in our capabilities. We expect ongoing opportunities for improved expense leverage, particularly in marketing and technology. In supply chain, we continue to invest in creating end-to-end value and improving the customer experience.
Our strategic brand partnerships represent another lever that enables us to provide a compelling product offering and strengthen our regular-price selling. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to remind you of our capital allocation principles. First and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in the business to create long-term shareholder value. Over the next 5 years, our CapEx plan of $3.2 billion or 4% of sales supports investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. In addition, we seek to return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and resumed share repurchase activity. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed the EPS range to $3.35 to $3.55, raising the low end to incorporate our first quarter performance. Our first year sales outlook remains unchanged, reflecting a comp sales increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our updated EBIT outlook assumes current credit revenue trends at a mid-teens growth rate.
As a reminder, our outlook includes the following sales timing considerations: While comp sales will be reported on a like-for-like basis, total sales will be impacted by shift from the Anniversary Sale; additionally, revenue recognition is not expected to materially impact full year sales, but there will be associated impacts related to the anniversary event shift. These 2 combined factors are estimated to create a timing impact to total sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in Q2 and Q3. Please refer to our appendix for further color.
Finally, before we turn to Q&A, we'd like to announce our plan to host an investor event on July 10. This will give us an opportunity to provide further insights into our customer strategy, how we're positioned for the future and drivers of long-term value creation. We plan to webcast the event and we'll follow-up with more details. Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

First of all, our profitability on those sales is really terrific, it's some of our highest profitable customer engagements that we have. So our goal is not only profitable, more importantly, they're some of our highest satisfaction services we provide. So our focus is to have more customers participate and we have a challenge on awareness. We offer a lot of services in our stores and it's not always as conspicuous to customers what those capabilities are. It's one of the things we've learned at the local store we opened in Los Angeles, by having a store that's all about services, it's been easier to communicate to customers what we can do, and engagement with a lot of those services has been terrific. So we're seeing nice growth in what we call our digitally enabled sales and we'll continue to do that. On supply chain, in general, we're looking to leverage the inventory we have to serve customers better. We think it's an advantage that we have a lot of inventory very, very close to our customers, which is in our stores. Our stores are obviously in the big markets, and that happens to be where the vast majority of our online customers are, too. So a big step in that will be opening a fulfillment center in Southern California. We're just getting underway on plans on that. But we'll be able to -- through that and some other initiatives we're working on, be able to offer our customers much bigger selection at much faster shipping rates. And it also leads to a pretty significant step in inventory efficiency for us, too."

There's a number of initiatives that we're working on. I think the thing that we're most encouraged about is that the customer accounts are flat. So we still have a lot of great foot traffic, and we have a real opportunity if we get the mix and the buy right. Our inventories are in line, so we're fluid. We have open to buy. And we don't believe we have undue risk with markdowns. So we've been able to address that on a daily basis on those things that are underperforming.

So in terms of some of the new things we've done that have been successful, we have Alberts, SWEATY BETTY, [ Faison ], introduced Anthropologie Home. All that's been really great. But at the same time, we're also having really good designer business and established brands that you know.

Those trends started to shift towards the end of the quarter. So while you're right, it does show a deceleration. I think, there's some puts and takes in Q4. We feel pretty good about how we came out of Q1. Overall, if you look at our business, our full-price business over the last year, really 2 years, it's been incredibly stable and -- in terms of traffic and ticket and average price point, all those metrics.

And so there's a lot to goes into how we look at it. It's about investing in existing stores. We have a number of stores that we've made big investments in over the last few years and have plans to continue to invest in our best stores. In addition to that, we have a store that might to be the fifth or sixth store in the market that we opened when that made a lot of more sense, I think, 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago.

So we're strategic and opportunistic in terms of new store growth. We don't have a set number. Again, we're about 240. We're opening 6 in Canada this year. We have 6 stores in the U.S. and a relocation. We have 4 slated for 2019. So it's not a set number. It has to meet our criteria. These are all strong stores. So we're not looking to close stores in that. But we do think, in general, that we have a very strong base with that strong digital base to best serve the customer. Your second question was regarding Women's, and you asked about the weather or the seasonal part that I mentioned and were there any other execution issues. Yes, there was. But I think the most material was some bets that we made in some areas that were more seasonally related that, in Q1 at least, didn't play out as well, and the customer voted. Your other question was, were there any other businesses or merchandise areas within the Rack that missed plan. No, I would say, predominantly, the other merchandise areas met or slightly exceeded their plans against. Since Women's is such a large part of the business, it had an impact on it. But across the board, we see lots of opportunities, and that's what we're getting after. We have a number of tests that we're working on right now. This is a business that's pretty nimble and agile. And so we can take those learnings and the feedback we get from our people and the customer, apply it, and literally, within 30 days, get some feedback and make some adjustments.

Yes, it's -- you're talking about last year, really spent -- the team spent all of last year doing a pretty deep dive and change that took the business model mainly around the Trunk business. We do have clubhouses, but the majority of the business is through the Trunks. So we pulled back on marking last year to get the business model to a point where we think we can scale it. We think we're to that point right now. The last several months, in particular, again, we do it. It's about serving customers better. And our customers' response has been significantly more positive. In particular, it shows up in the keep rates we have from the Trunks we send out and the number of repeat Trunks that customers are signing up for. Both of those metrics are significantly improved from what we've had since we bought the business. So I would describe it as still early days, but we're certainly encouraged that the core of the business, the Trunk business, has a model that is something we're excited about. We're confident that success can continue and it's something we can get behind and start to leverage more."

So first, investing in the company and driving shareholder value that way and then looking at the best way to return cash to shareholders, whether it's dividends or share buyback. We do take a look at share buyback as a return metric, and we are a little opportunistic as we see the price maybe getting out of balance where we think the intrinsic value is of the company, we'll go be opportunistic in that manner. So -- and from an M&A perspective, again, we've got a very flexible balance sheet. So again, we're looking at what's the best -- right investments and the long-term return for the shareholders."

Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations",661,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations. We delivered total sales growth of 5.8%. This included an increase of around 250 basis points, primarily from a loyalty event shift. Comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, increased 0.6%. 
The investments we're making in digital continue to pay off. During the quarter, we generated an 18% increase in sales, enabled through our digital capabilities, compared to the previous year. Our full-price comp sales increase of 0.7% was generally consistent with our trends. Our off-price comp sales increased 0.4%. While we're not satisfied with recent trends in our stores, we're focused on making improvements to our Rack business. 
On April 12, we achieved a significant milestone in our company's history with the opening of our first ever full-line Men's Store in New York City located near Columbus Circle. This 3-level, 47,000-square-foot store features our latest service experiences to help serve customers on their terms, including express returns kiosk, same-day delivery, 24x7 buy online and pick up in store and unique brand partnerships. Our Men's Store opened ahead of our New York City flagship, which is scheduled for fall of 2019, and we're off to a good start. Manhattan is a premier retail destination and represents our largest online market serving customers. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in new markets, we also expect this flagship to deliver a meaningful sales lift in New York City. 
This quarter marked another important achievement with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada. Like our experience in the U.S., we expect synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. We're seeing terrific results from our 3 store openings this spring in the Toronto and Calgary markets, with 3 more openings planned for this fall. 
We continue to grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice for brands and providing customers with newness. We want to create a sense of discovery through these collaborations, while supporting our regular price sell-in. Our strategic brands include new and emerging partners, along with established ones. 
During the time of transformation in the industry, we've been investing in digital capabilities to expand our customer reach and engagement. This uniquely positions us to increase market share and drive growth. Our customer-focused approach informs how we allocate capital with the goal of driving customer engagement, market share gains and improved profitability. 
In our top markets, we're further integrating our digital and physical assets across supply chain, technology, marketing and merchandising to deliver differentiated services and experiences. To lead our efforts, we recently named Ken Worzel as our Chief Digital Officer. As one of our top leaders, Ken is instrumental in driving our digital strategy as we continue to evolve our business. He will also continue in his role as President of Nordstrom.com. 
This year, we're launching efforts to link our capabilities in our largest market, Los Angeles, and recently kicked off our efforts with a group of highly engaged customers to co-create unique customer shopping journeys. We intend to apply our learnings from L.A. to quickly scale to other markets. 
We continue to see positive trends in customer metrics, which are an important way we measure our progress in gaining new customers and increasing engagement with existing ones. The growth in active customers and customer shopping across multiple channels continues to outpace sales growth, which helps contribute to market share gains. 
As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars, providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook for the year."
32215,562146877,1470755,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues c",660,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues came in better than expected, the result of our recent efforts to drive new account growth.
In full-price, our core U.S. business had stabilized trends. Also, Trunk Club showed significant improvement. In off-price, sales were slightly below our plan, reflecting outsized digital growth, offset by Nordstrom Rack stores' performance. As Blake mentioned, we expect improvements throughout the year.
Turning to gross profit. Our rate was down approximately 20 basis points relative to last year. This was due to higher occupancy related to U.S. and Canada Rack openings, in addition to planned preopening expenses associated with the New York Men's Store. Merchandise margins were in line with expectations in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in regular-priced selling trends. We exited the quarter in good inventory position, with sales growth exceeding a 2% decline in inventory. 
Our SG&A rate was roughly 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to preopening expenses for the New York Men's store. Our SG&A rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends as we continue to benefit from productivity gains in marketing, technology and supply chain.
Next, I'd like to provide further insights on our path forward. As we shared in last quarter's call, we expect 2018 to be an inflection point for improved profitability based on the following drivers: We've made generational investments in Canada and Manhattan and through our acquisitions of HauteLook and Trunk Club. We anticipate operating improvements as these businesses scale. We're also benefiting from productivity gains as a result of foundational investments in our capabilities. We expect ongoing opportunities for improved expense leverage, particularly in marketing and technology. In supply chain, we continue to invest in creating end-to-end value and improving the customer experience.
Our strategic brand partnerships represent another lever that enables us to provide a compelling product offering and strengthen our regular-price selling. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to remind you of our capital allocation principles. First and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in the business to create long-term shareholder value. Over the next 5 years, our CapEx plan of $3.2 billion or 4% of sales supports investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. In addition, we seek to return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and resumed share repurchase activity. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed the EPS range to $3.35 to $3.55, raising the low end to incorporate our first quarter performance. Our first year sales outlook remains unchanged, reflecting a comp sales increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our updated EBIT outlook assumes current credit revenue trends at a mid-teens growth rate.
As a reminder, our outlook includes the following sales timing considerations: While comp sales will be reported on a like-for-like basis, total sales will be impacted by an event shift from the Anniversary Sale; additionally, revenue recognition is not expected to materially impact full year sales, but there will be associated impacts related to the anniversary event shift. These 2 combined factors are estimated to create a timing impact to total sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in Q2 and Q3. Please refer to our appendix for further color.
Finally, before we turn to Q&A, we'd like to announce our plan to host an investor event on July 10. This will give us an opportunity to provide further insights into our customer strategy, how we're positioned for the future and drivers of long-term value creation. We plan to webcast the event and we'll follow-up with more details. Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So our goal is [ not only profitable, ] more importantly, they're some of our highest satisfaction services we provide. So our focus is to have more customers participate and we have a challenge on awareness. We offer a lot of services in our stores and it's not always as conspicuous to customers what those capabilities are. It's one of the things we've learned at the local store we opened in Los Angeles, by having a store that's all about services, it's been easier to communicate to customers what we can do, and engagement with a lot of those services has been terrific. So we're seeing nice growth in what we call our digitally enabled sales and we'll continue to do that. On supply chain, in general, we're looking to leverage the inventory we have to serve customers better. We think it's an advantage that we have a lot of inventory very, very close to our customers, which is in our stores. Our stores are obviously in the big markets, and that happens to be where the vast majority of our online customers are, too. So a big step in that will be opening a fulfillment center in Southern California. We're just getting underway on plans on that. But we'll be able to -- through that and some other initiatives we're working on, be able to offer our customers much bigger selection at much faster shipping rates. And it also leads to a pretty significant step in inventory efficiency for us, too."

But I'd say, our women's shoe business, if we can get that humming along, that could make a big difference. We've had continued strength in the accessories, handbags, beauty part of our business, which just continues to do really well. You heard me mention the designer part. That's the best growing part of our businesses, designer across, the handbags, the women's apparel and the men's apparel and shoe offerings. And as good as that is, I think, it suggests it could be better. So we think we can do more that way as well. There's a lot to be encouraged about, I think. And again, we talked about the established brands. You've got brands like Lauder or Nike and people like that, that have been around for a long time, and we have good, strong business with them and good collaborative efforts."

So it's -- we're really looking at this less on a channel basis and more on a comp and total sales based on full-price and off-price. So that's number one. So when you look at that release that we did, it actually show -- we showed that on a comparable basis. We went in and revised it, so you can see the overall trends in that full-price business.

Your second question was regarding Women's, and you asked about the weather or the seasonal part that I mentioned and were there any other execution issues. Yes, there was. But I think the most material was some bets that we made in some areas that were more seasonally related that, in Q1 at least, didn't play out as well, and the customer voted. Your other question was, were there any other businesses or merchandise areas within the Rack that missed plan. No, I would say, predominantly, the other merchandise areas met or slightly exceeded their plans. Again, since Women's is such a large part of the business, it had an impact on it. But across the board, we see lots of opportunities, and that's what we're getting after. We have a number of tests that we're working on right now. This is a business that's pretty nimble and agile. And so we can take those learnings and the feedback we get from our people and the customer, apply it, and literally, within 30 days, get some feedback and make some adjustments.

Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations",661,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways. Our overall sales performance was in line with our expectations. We delivered total sales growth of 5.8%. This included an increase of around 250 basis points, primarily from a loyalty event shift. Comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, increased 0.6%. 
The investments we're making in digital continue to pay off. During the quarter, we generated an 18% increase in sales, enabled through our digital capabilities, compared to the previous year. Our full-price comp sales increase of 0.7% was generally consistent with our trends. Our off-price comp sales increased 0.4%. While we're not satisfied with recent trends in our stores, we're focused on making improvements to our Rack business. 
On April 12, we achieved a significant milestone in our company's history with the opening of our first ever full-line Men's Store in New York City located near Columbus Circle. This 3-level, 47,000-square-foot store features our latest service experiences to help serve customers on their terms, including express returns kiosk, same-day delivery, 24x7 buy online and pick up in store and unique brand partnerships. Our Men's Store opened ahead of our New York City flagship, which is scheduled for fall of 2019, and we're off to a good start. Manhattan is a premier retail destination and represents our largest online market serving customers. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in new markets, we also expect this flagship to deliver a meaningful sales lift in New York City. 
This quarter marked another important achievement with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada. Like our experience in the U.S., we expect synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. We're seeing terrific results from our 3 store openings this spring in the Toronto and Calgary markets, with 3 more openings planned for this fall. 
We continue to grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice for brands and providing customers with newness. We want to create a sense of discovery through these collaborations while supporting our regular price sell-in. Our strategic brands include new and emerging partners, along with established ones. 
During the time of transformation in the industry, we've been investing in digital capabilities to expand our customer reach and engagement. This uniquely positions us to increase market share and drive growth. Our customer-focused approach informs how we allocate capital with the goal of driving customer engagement, market share gains and improved profitability. 
In our top markets, we're further integrating our digital and physical assets across supply chain, technology, marketing and merchandising to deliver differentiated services and experiences. To lead our efforts, we recently named Ken Worzel as our Chief Digital Officer. As one of our top leaders, Ken is instrumental in driving our digital strategy as we continue to evolve our business. He will also continue in his role as President of Nordstrom.com. 
This year, we're launching efforts to link our capabilities in our largest market, Los Angeles, and recently kicked off our efforts with a group of highly engaged customers to co-create unique customer shopping journeys. We intend to apply our learnings from L.A. to quickly scale to other markets. 
We continue to see positive trends in customer metrics, which are an important way we measure our progress in gaining new customers and increasing engagement with existing ones. The growth in active customers and customer shopping across multiple channels continues to outpace sales growth, which helps contribute to market share gains. 
As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on 3 strategic pillars, providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of our brand. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook for the year."
32215,562146877,1471252,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues c",660,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS at $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues came in better than expected, the result of our recent efforts to drive new account growth.
In full-price, our core U.S. business had stabilized trends. Also, Trunk Club showed significant improvement. In off-price, sales were slightly below our plan, reflecting outsized digital growth, offset by Nordstrom Rack stores' performance. As Blake mentioned, we expect improvements throughout the year.
Turning to gross profit. Our rate was down approximately 20 basis points relative to last year. This was due to higher occupancy related to U.S. and Canada Rack openings, in addition to planned preopening expenses associated with the New York Men's Store. Merchandise margins were in line with expectations in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in regular-priced selling trends. We exited the quarter in good inventory position, with sales growth exceeding a 2% decline in inventory. 
Our SG&A rate was roughly 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to preopening expenses for the New York Men's store. Our SG&A rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends as we continue to benefit from productivity gains in marketing, technology and supply chain.
Next, I'd like to provide further insights on our path forward. As we shared in last quarter's call, we expect 2018 to be an inflection point for improved profitability based on the following drivers: We've made generational investments in Canada and Manhattan and through our acquisitions of HauteLook and Trunk Club. We anticipate operating improvements as these businesses scale. We're also benefiting from productivity gains as a result of foundational investments in our capabilities. We expect ongoing opportunities for improved expense leverage, particularly in marketing and technology. In supply chain, we continue to invest in creating end-to-end value and improving the customer experience.
Our strategic brand partnerships represent another lever that enables us to provide a compelling product offering and strengthen our regular-price selling. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to remind you of our capital allocation principles. First and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in the business to create long-term shareholder value. Over the next 5 years, our CapEx plan of $3.2 billion or 4% of sales supports investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. In addition, we seek to return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and resumed share repurchase activity. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed the EPS range to $3.35 to $3.55, raising the low end to incorporate our first quarter performance. Our first year sales outlook remains unchanged, reflecting a comp sales increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our updated EBIT outlook assumes current credit revenue trends at a mid-teens growth rate.
As a reminder, our outlook includes the following sales timing considerations: While comp sales will be reported on a like-for-like basis, total sales will be impacted by an event shift from the Anniversary Sale; additionally, revenue recognition is not expected to materially impact full year sales, but there will be associated impacts related to the anniversary event shift. These 2 combined factors are estimated to create a timing impact to total sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in Q2 and Q3. Please refer to our appendix for further color.
Finally, before we turn to Q&A, we'd like to announce our plan to host an investor event on July 10. This will give us an opportunity to provide further insights into our customer strategy, how we're positioned for the future and drivers of long-term value creation. We plan to webcast the event and we'll follow-up with more details. Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

It's one of the things we've learned at the local store we opened in Los Angeles, by having a store that's all about services, it's been easier to communicate to customers what we can do, and engagement with a lot of those services has been terrific. So we're seeing nice growth in what we call our digitally enabled sales and we'll continue to do that. On supply chain, in general, we're looking to leverage the inventory we have to serve customers better. We think it's an advantage that we have a lot of inventory very, very close to our customers, which is in our stores. Our stores are obviously in the big markets, and that happens to be where the vast majority of our online customers are, too. So a big step in that will be opening a fulfillment center in Southern California. We're just getting underway on plans on that. But we'll be able to -- through that and some other initiatives we're working on, be able to offer our customers much bigger selection at much faster shipping rates. And it also leads to a pretty significant step in inventory efficiency for us, too."

There's a number of initiatives that we're working on. I think the thing that we're most encouraged about is that the customer accounts are flat.

Do you think there were any execution issues? And was that the only business that missed the plan?"

I'd reiterate what Erik mentioned earlier. We're looking at market-by-market. And we have more mature markets. We happen to be calling from Los Angeles right now where we've been doing business for 40 years. Some of these stores, we opened in centers that were once better than they are now and we've got some stores that are in centers that are doing better than ever. And so there's a lot to goes into how we look at it. It's about investing in existing stores. We have a number of stores that we've made big investments in over the last few years and have plans to continue to invest in our best stores. In addition to that, we have a store that might to be the fifth or sixth store in the market that we opened when that made a lot of more sense, I think, 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago. And you've seen us close some of those stores. So it's a combination of investing in our best stores, culling those stores that are in malls that are not as relevant anymore, but overall, looking at it market-by-market and seeing how we can be as effective as possible in serving our customers there."

And we're very pleased to have a great, robust online business as well. It was just shy of $1 billion last year. So we're in earlier days of trying to understand, as Erik talked about earlier, and Jamie, about looking at it from the customers' point of view and how we can best serve them, both in the physical bricks-and-mortar and also digitally. So we're strategic and opportunistic in terms of new store growth. We don't have a set number. Again, we're about 240. We're opening 6 in Canada this year. We have 6 stores in the U.S. and a relocation. We have 4 slated for 2019. So it's not a set number. It has to meet our criteria. These are all strong stores. So we're not looking to close stores in that. But we do think, in general, that we have a very strong base with that strong digital base to best serve the customer. Your second question was regarding Women's, and you asked about the weather or the seasonal part that I mentioned and were there any other execution issues. Yes, there was. But I think the most material was some bets that we made in some areas that were more seasonally related that, in Q1 at least, didn't play out as well, and the customer voted. Your other question was, were there any other businesses or merchandise areas within the Rack that missed plan. No, I would say, predominantly, the other merchandise areas met or slightly exceeded their plans. Again, since Women's is such a large part of the business, it had an impact on it. But across the board, we see lots of opportunities, and that's what we're getting after. We have a number of tests that we're working on right now. This is a business that's pretty nimble and agile. And so we can take those learnings and the feedback we get from our people and the customer, apply it, and literally, within 30 days, get some feedback and make some adjustments. And the fact that our inventories are in line, it's a real strength for us."

For those who missed it, we have made the webcast available on our Investor Relations website. We've laid out the strategy and will continue to build on this foundation as we execute and measure our outcomes. 
Our second quarter results reflect our progress in achieving our long-term financial commitments. In the second quarter, we reported a total sales increase of approximately 7% and earnings per share of $0.95. We remain on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth. As a reminder, over the course of this year, there are timing impacts related to the shift in the calendar and the new revenue recognition standard. In the second quarter, this represented a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points on total sales and $30 million on EBIT. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter, resulting in an unfavorable impact. To help provide further clarity, we posted our slides ahead of this call, and Anne will share additional insights in her remarks.
Because of these nuances on total sales this year, we're also providing color on our comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, with no impacts on the calendar shift or revenue recognition. For the second quarter, comp sales increased 4%, driven by growth across both full-price and off-price. 
We had robust digital sales growth for the quarter, reflecting our market-leading presence and significant progress toward our long-term goals. Digital sales grew 23% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from a year ago and accounted for 34% of our sales. 
In full-price, we had a comp increase of 4.1% for the quarter. We recently completed our one-of-a-kind Anniversary Sale, an event that distinguishes us in the industry by featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Anniversary generates significant volume that rivals even our holiday period. 
We continued to see a heightened shift of customers shopping online during the anniversary. Digital sales accounted for more than 40% of our event. On the first day of Early Access for our Nordstrom cardholders, we had our biggest day ever online, exceeding our previous record by 80% at 10x our average daily demand. We worked hard to manage our systems for peak demand. Despite our efforts, we experienced some website issues as we encountered unprecedented levels of demand on the first day of the event. While our team resolved this, we know we disappointed many of our customers, and in response, we offered cardholders 10 points per dollar on purchases made on the first day of anniversary. 
While we had a solid anniversary overall, we're well aware of that we have opportunities to better meet our customers' expectations. We've learned a lot and are highly committed to improving our execution. 
From a merchandising perspective, our partnerships with strategic brands enable us to provide customers with compelling offers and strengthen our product margin. In the second quarter, sales from strategic brands grew 13%, making up around 45% of our full-price business. We are positioned to achieve our long-term plans for strategic brand growth that we shared during Investor Day. 
Our off-price business delivered a comp increase of 4% for the second quarter. The strength of our inventory position allowed us to be fluid and respond quickly. We took swift action to accelerate inventory turns, strengthen our core assortment and improve our execution in stores. Our second quarter comp sales exceeded our plans by a couple of hundred basis points, and we expect to carry and build upon this momentum during the second half of the year. We also continue to deliver 25%-plus sales gains in our digital business, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. 
One of the primary topics we discussed during our Investor Day was our local market strategy, a cornerstone of how we will win with customers and increase shareholder value. When customers engage with us across stores and online, on average, they spend 5x more, and profitability per customer doubles. Through our focus on our top markets, we're combining the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people, product and place to drive increased customer engagement and gain market share. We're starting in our largest market, Los Angeles, where we're bringing all of our digital and physical assets together in a seamless ecosystem. We're continuing to invest in supply chain, a critical enabler of the customer experience. We have identified sites for our West Coast fulfillment center and local omnichannel hub, which are scheduled to open in late 2019. These investments in our supply chain network will help us adjust our opportunities to better serve customers, improve our efficiencies and leverage inventory in our local markets.
Last month, we announced that 2 additional Nordstrom Local concepts will open in the L.A. market this fall. These neighborhood hubs are one component of our local market strategy to engage with customers through more convenient access to products and services such as Buy Online Pick Up In Store, alterations, store reserve and personal styling.
Technology is a critical component of our ambition to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world. On that front, we're pleased that Edmond Mesrobian has joined our executive team as Chief Technology Officer. Edmond brings nearly 3 decades of experience from large and complex international companies, including Tesco and Expedia. He will support all aspects of technology across the company and focus on advancing our capabilities to deliver the best experience to our customers however they choose to shop with us.
In closing, we believe we are leading the future of retail through our customer strategy centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering outstanding services and experiences and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. We are confident in our path forward and are well positioned to achieve our financial plans for the year and over the long run.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide more color on our second quarter and expectations for the year."

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan.

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. 
To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns through 3 deliverables: growing market share, improving profitability and returns and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach. 
Second, we're on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth as we scale our generational investments in digital capabilities. 
And third, as our model evolves and we near completion of our heavy investment cycle over the next couple of years, we plan to return to mid-teens ROIC and accelerate free cash flow.
Our second quarter demonstrated our progress in achieving these financial goals. Q2 EPS of $0.95 reflect the top line strength across our businesses and throughout the quarter. Based on our first half results, we have raised our full year outlook from a top and bottom line perspective.
Now I'll provide further details around the timing shifts. As Blake mentioned, quarterly comparisons to the prior year are impacted because of last year's 53-week calendar and revenue recognition changes. For the second and third quarters, the primary driver of timing shifts is revenue recognition.  The shift of events, triple points, anniversary and half yearly largely offset within the second and third quarters. For example, in the second quarter, the unfavorable impact of triple points was largely offset by the favorable impact of anniversary. 
For the second quarter, we had a total sales increase of approximately 7%, including a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points, which will fully reverse in the third quarter. This primarily represented the impact of revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of anniversary.
As Blake mentioned, comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, which means there are no impacts from events shifts or revenue recognition. While we are providing color on our comp performance given this year's unique nuances, we're focusing on total market and sales performance as comps become less relevant over time. 
As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we made changes to our sales reporting to align with how we view our results internally. We now allocate certain corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns to our full-price and off-price businesses. These allocation changes do not impact sales at a total company level, but they do impact prior year comparisons for full-price and off-price. It's also important to keep in mind that we don't believe our sales trends on a quarter-over-quarter basis are necessarily predictive due to the seasonal nature of our business. For example, anniversary has become less of an indicator for second half performance as our merchandise offering continues to shift from fall to Wear NOW. We view our underlying trends over a longer-term horizon, which has generally been consistent over the past several years.
Now I'd like to walk through some of the timing impacts on the other areas of P&L and provide some color on our anniversary execution.
First, the gross profit increase of approximately 90 basis points included a favorable shift of $30 million due to revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of anniversary. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter. More specifically, it represents in-transit sales that are now recognized as shipment under the new standard rather than deferred. There is an elevated impact relative to last year due to the high volume of online sales for anniversary at the end of the quarter.
The second callout is related to an unplanned 10-point loyalty offering made in response to the site outage on the first day of anniversary. This reduced gross profit by approximately $12 million in Q2 and is expected to be roughly EBIT-neutral by the end of the year as customers redeem their notes. In Q2 last year, we had a similar loyalty accommodation, so the impact is minimal on a year-over-year basis. 
Our gross profit performance reflected higher product margins from continued regular price selling trends and leverage on occupancy expenses. From an inventory perspective, we ended the quarter with a positive spread between inventory and sales growth, in line with our expectations. 
Moving to SG&A. Our rate increased around 70 basis points over last year. This reflected higher fulfillment and delivery expenses related to digital growth and peak online demand during anniversary. Coming off the event, we expect supply chain costs to return to recent levels. We're focused on continuing to bend the curve in expense growth to remain on track for a mid-single-digit increase for the year. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our philosophy is to maintain a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. We're also focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. 
Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. We had approximately $90 million in share repurchases year-to-date. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We've raised our EPS outlook from a range of $3.35 to $3.55 to a range of $3.50 to $3.65. This incorporates our first half results while maintaining our assumptions for the second half of the year.
From a comp perspective, we've raised our full year expectations from a 0.5% to 1.5% increase to a 1.5% to 2% increase. This assumes a continuation of underlying sales trends in the second half of the year. 
From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect modest improvement in product margins and a consistent occupancy rate relative to last year.
For the second half of the year, we expect Q3 to contribute roughly 30% in EBIT and Q4 to contribute 70%. We have the following quarterly callouts. Q3 EBIT margin is planned to leverage on fixed expenses and includes a $30 million unfavorable shift from Q2 associated with the impact of revenue recognition. Q4 EBIT margin is planned to leverage on higher sales volume and reflects a favorable comparison of $16 million from a onetime employee investment associated with last year's tax reform. When normalizing for this onetime impact, Q4's planned EBIT contribution in the second half is generally consistent with historical trends. 
We remain confident that 2018 is an inflection point for long-term profitable growth. Our drivers of EBIT margin improvement include continued strengthen in our product margins, scaling of generational investments and leveraging our digital capabilities. We're encouraged by our progress to date, and we're tracking well against our financial plans. 
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So we're learning a lot about operating a men's-only store. We're learning a lot about traffic trends in New York, particularly summer comes along. And -- but mostly, I think, what we're really encouraged by a lot of the qualitative response we've had from customers, from people in our industry, who's visited our store, the team we put together their. And we're encouraged by our long-term prospects. So a lot more to come there, particularly next fall when we get the tower opened, and we'll really be able to have our full offer there and serving Manhattan in a more robust way. In regards to Canada, this past spring, we opened our first 3 Rack stores in Canada. Those were delayed. We'd hoped to have the Rack stores opened earlier than this. And as we shared before, our Rack stores play a really critical role in allowing us to have great flow of newness in our full-priced stores. And so it's nice to get those stores open. I can tell you that we are exceeding expectations in those 3 Rack stores. The team has done a terrific job of getting them opened. We've got 3 more opening this fall. And we think that by bringing our Rack business there, along with our full-priced business, we'll start to be able to be offering more of the full Nordstrom experience. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to improve our flow of merchandise into Canada and getting across the border. It's different than shipping within the U.S. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our effectiveness there, and we're encouraged about getting after those opportunities in the back half of this year."

So we are continuing to bend the curve on this. I would say that -- and we talked about this in the Investor Day, but the 2 areas that we've already seen leveraging and marketing and technology.

But that said, there's always lots of opportunities with our business, and so we're really encouraged by those and believe some of the fundamental principles that they are particularly focused on represent tremendous opportunities as well as looking at the off-price. I mean, we are, this year, crossing the $1 billion mark with our Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook business. And in off-price world, there's really no one that has kind of our model and our approach and both that kind of multichannel omnichannel experience in off-price that we have. And so we are excited about that and think that you'll see going forward continued improvement with those results."

In terms of store traffic, we've not seen a material change in our store traffic trends for quite a while now, frankly. Certainly, the last quarters, it's been pretty consistent. I think what's changed, and it has for everybody, is that when a 30-year business is done online in any given market, the nature of that traffic is different. A lot of those customers are coming in having already decided what they want to buy because they've been shopping on our website or they're coming in to get alterations on something they bought on Nordstrom.com or any number of different versions of a digital to in-store experience. And so part of our big opportunity is looking at our stores and figuring out how do we need to evolve them the staffing model, the layout, the services and experiences that we offer in those stores to continue to be relevant to that customer who spends some time shopping on our website. When they come into the store, is their experience matching what their expectations are? And so that's a big focus of ours in Los Angeles. But for all of our major markets, we know that, that's what the customer expects, and that's where our focus is."

You hear them talk about, too. Shipping things so early in the season. Sometimes it's difficult.

Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For t",1038,"Good afternoon, everyone. Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For those who missed it, we have made the webcast available on our Investor Relations website. We've laid out the strategy and will continue to build on this foundation as we execute and measure our outcomes. 
Our second quarter results reflect our progress in achieving our long-term financial commitments. In the second quarter, we reported a total sales increase of approximately 7% and earnings per share of $0.95. We remain on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth. As a reminder, over the course of this year, there are timing impacts related to the shift in the calendar and the new revenue recognition standard. In the second quarter, this represented a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points on total sales and $30 million on EBIT. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter, resulting in an unfavorable impact. To help provide further clarity, we posted our slides ahead of this call, and Anne will share additional insights in her remarks.
Because of these nuances on total sales this year, we're also providing color on our comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis with no impacts on the calendar shift or revenue recognition. For the second quarter, comp sales increased 4%, driven by growth across both full-price and off-price. 
We had robust digital sales growth for the quarter, reflecting our market-leading presence and significant progress toward our long-term goals. Digital sales grew 23% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from a year ago and accounted for 34% of our sales. 
In full-price, we had a comp increase of 4.1% for the quarter. We recently completed our one-of-a-kind Anniversary Sale, an event that distinguishes us in the industry by featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Anniversary generates significant volume that rivals even our holiday period. 
We continued to see a heightened shift of customers shopping online during the anniversary. Digital sales accounted for more than 40% of our event. On the first day of Early Access for our Nordstrom cardholders, we had our biggest day ever online, exceeding our previous record by 80% at 10x our average daily demand. We worked hard to manage our systems for peak demand. Despite our efforts, we experienced some website issues as we encountered unprecedented levels of demand on the first day of the event. While our team resolved this, we know we disappointed many of our customers, and in response, we offered cardholders 10 points per dollar on purchases made on the first day of anniversary. 
While we had a solid anniversary overall, we're well aware that we have opportunities to better meet our customers' expectations. We've learned a lot and are highly committed to improving our execution. 
From a merchandising perspective, our partnerships with strategic brands enable us to provide customers with compelling offers and strengthen our product margin. In the second quarter, sales from strategic brands grew 13%, making up around 45% of our full-price business. We are positioned to achieve our long-term plans for strategic brand growth that we shared during Investor Day. 
Our off-price business delivered a comp increase of 4% for the second quarter. The strength of our inventory position allowed us to be fluid and respond quickly. We took swift action to accelerate inventory turns, strengthen our core assortment and improve our execution in stores. Our second quarter comp sales exceeded our plans by a couple of hundred basis points, and we expect to carry and build upon this momentum during the second half of the year. We also continue to deliver 25%-plus sales gains in our digital business, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. 
One of the primary topics we discussed during our Investor Day was our local market strategy, a cornerstone of how we will win with customers and increase shareholder value. When customers engage with us across stores and online, on average, they spend 5x more and profitability per customer doubles. Through our focus on our top markets, we're combining the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people, product and place to drive increased customer engagement and gain market share. 
We're starting in our largest market, Los Angeles, where we're bringing all of our digital and physical assets together in a seamless ecosystem. We're continuing to invest in supply chain, a critical enabler of the customer experience. We have identified sites for our West Coast fulfillment center and local omni-channel hub, which are scheduled to open in late 2019. These investments in our supply chain network will help us adjust our opportunities to better serve customers, improve our efficiencies and leverage inventory in our local markets.
Last month, we announced that 2 additional Nordstrom Local concepts will open in the L.A. market this fall. These neighborhood hubs are one component of our local market strategy to engage with customers through more convenient access to products and services such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, alterations, store reserve and personal styling.
Technology is a critical component of our ambition to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world. On that front, we're pleased that Edmond Mesrobian has joined our executive team as Chief Technology Officer. Edmond brings nearly 3 decades of experience from large and complex international companies, including Tesco and Expedia. He will support all aspects of technology across the company and focus on advancing our capabilities to deliver the best experience to our customers however they choose to shop with us.
In closing, we believe we are leading the future of retail through our customer strategy centered on 3 strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering outstanding services and experiences and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. We are confident in our path forward and are well positioned to achieve our financial plans for the year and over the long run.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide more color on our second quarter and expectations for the year."
32215,576185676,1536563,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2018",2018-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns",1085,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns through 3 deliverables: growing market share, improving profitability and returns and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach.  Second, we're on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth as we scale our generational investments and digital capabilities.  And third, as our model evolves and we near completion of our heavy investment cycle over the next couple of years, we plan to return to mid-teens ROIC and accelerate free cash flow.
Our second quarter demonstrated our progress in achieving these financial goals. Q2 EPS of $0.95 reflect the top line strength across our businesses and throughout the quarter. Based on our first half results, we have raised our full year outlook from a top and bottom line perspective.
Now I'll provide further details around the timing shifts. As Blake mentioned, quarterly comparisons to the prior year are impacted because of last year's 53-week calendar and revenue recognition changes. For the second and third quarters, the primary driver of timing shifts is revenue recognition. The shift of events, Triple Points, Anniversary and Half-Yearly largely offset within the second and third quarters. For example, in the second quarter, the unfavorable impact of Triple Points was largely offset by the favorable impact of Anniversary. 
For the second quarter, we had a total sales increase of approximately 7%, including a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points, which will fully reverse in the third quarter. This primarily represented the impact of revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary.
As Blake mentioned, comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, which means there are no impacts from event shifts or revenue recognition. While we are providing color on our comp performance given this year's unique nuances, we're focusing on total market and sales performance as comps become less relevant over time. 
As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we made changes to our sales reporting to align with how we view our results internally. We now allocate certain corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns to our full-price and off-price businesses. These allocation changes do not impact sales at a total company level, but they do impact prior year comparisons for full-price and off-price. 
It's also important to keep in mind that we don't believe our sales trends on a quarter-over-quarter basis are necessarily predictive due to the seasonal nature of our business. For example, Anniversary has become less of an indicator for second half performance as our merchandise offering continues to shift from fall to wear now. We view our underlying trends over a longer-term horizon, which has generally been consistent over the past several years.
Now I'd like to walk through some timing impacts on the other areas of P&L and provide some color on our Anniversary execution. First, the gross profit increase of approximately 90 basis points included a favorable shift of $30 million due to revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter. More specifically, it represents in-transit sales that are now recognized as shipment under the new standard rather than deferred. There is an elevated impact relative to last year due to the high volume of online sales for Anniversary at the end of the quarter.
The second call-out is related to an unplanned 10-point loyalty offering made in response to the site outage on the first day of Anniversary. This reduced gross profit by approximately $12 million in Q2 and is expected to be roughly EBIT-neutral by the end of the year as customers redeem their notes. In Q2 last year, we had a similar loyalty accommodation, so the impact is minimal on a year-over-year basis. 
Our gross profit performance reflected higher product margins from continued regular-price selling trends and leverage on occupancy expenses. From an inventory perspective, we ended the quarter with a positive spread between inventory and sales growth, in line with our expectations. 
Moving to SG&A. Our rate increased around 70 basis points over last year. This reflected higher fulfillment and delivery expenses related to digital growth and peak online demand during Anniversary. Coming off the event, we expect supply chain costs to return to recent levels. We're focused on continuing to bend the curve in expense growth to remain on track for a mid-single-digit increase for the year. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our philosophy is to maintain a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. We're also focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. We had approximately $90 million in share repurchases year-to-date. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We've raised our EPS outlook from a range of $3.35 to $3.55 to a range of $3.50 to $3.65. This incorporates our first half results while maintaining our assumptions for the second half of the year. From a comp perspective, we've raised our full year expectations from a 0.5% to 1.5% increase to a 1.5% to 2% increase. This assumes a continuation of underlying sales trends in the second half of the year. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect modest improvement in product margins and a consistent occupancy rate relative to last year.  For the second half of the year, we expect Q3 to contribute roughly 30% of EBIT and Q4 to contribute 70%. 
We have the following quarterly call-outs. Q3 EBIT margin is planned to deleverage on fixed expenses and includes a $30 million unfavorable shift from Q2 associated with the impact of revenue recognition. Q4 EBIT margin is planned to leverage on higher sales volume and reflects a favorable comparison of $16 million from a onetime employee investment associated with last year's tax reform. When normalizing for this onetime impact, Q4's planned EBIT contribution in the second half is generally consistent with historical trends. 
We remain confident that 2018 is an inflection point for long-term profitable growth. Our drivers of EBIT margin improvement include continued strength in our product margins, scaling of generational investments and leveraging our digital capabilities. We're encouraged by our progress to date, and we're tracking well against our financial plans.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

And we alluded at the Investor Day that we felt that we were heavy with our inventories, and he's been able to, with the team, take some inventory back of the house. And so it's about $85 million less on a comp store basis in our stores. We don't think it's changed what's happening in front of the house.

So we really tried to be as transparent as we possibly could. The road map is out for you guys. So I think keeping -- you need to keep in mind as you look at the Q2, Q3 pieces to it is the revenue recognition piece, and gross margin is a good guy in Q2 and a bad guy in Q3. So that's going to have a negative impact on margin. As well as traditionally, Q3 is a lower-volume quarter for us. So as you would expect, and consistent with what we see with historical trends, the way we've planned it out is that our expenses, both buying and occupancy and SG&A, would deleverage, consistent with what we've seen historically just based on the top line volume components to it. So that's really kind of the headlines around that."

In regards to Manhattan, we opened our Men's Store this past spring. It's the first time we ever had a men's-only store. And as we call it, it was opportunistic that we could get that space and open it over a year before our main store that will be mostly focused on women's. So we're learning a lot about operating a men's-only store. We're learning a lot about traffic trends in New York, particularly as summer comes along. But mostly, I think what we're really encouraged by is a lot of the qualitative response we've had from customers, from people in our industry who visited that store, the team we put together there, and we're encouraged by our long-term prospects. So a lot more to come there, particularly next fall, when we get the Tower open, and we'll really be able to have our full offer there and serving Manhattan in a more robust way. In regards to Canada, this past spring, we opened our first 3 Rack stores in Canada. Those were delayed. We'd hoped to have Rack stores opened earlier than this. And as we shared before, our Rack stores play a really critical role in allowing us to have a great flow of newness in our full-price stores. And so it's nice to get those stores open. I can tell you that we are exceeding expectations in those 3 Rack stores. The team has done a terrific job of getting them open. We've got 3 more opening this fall. And we think that by bringing our Rack business there, along with our full-price business, we'll start to be able to be offering more of the full Nordstrom experience. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to improve our flow of merchandise into Canada, getting across the border. It's different than shipping within the U.S. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our effectiveness there, and we're encouraged about getting after those opportunities in the back half of this year."

So if you look at the investments that we started making back in 2010, 2012, our investments in those 3 key capabilities, which is marketing, technology and supply chain, were growing at 20%. So there was a high-growth and high-investment period. From 2015 to 2017, we've bent the curve, and it was down to about 10%. And as we gave guidance for this year and also during the Investor Day, we spent quite a bit of time talking about this as well, is that our guidance on these capabilities is that it's growing at about mid-single digit. So we're continuing to bend the curve on this. I would say that -- and we talked about this in the Investor Day, but the 2 areas that we've already seen leverage in those areas are marketing and technology. And as we talked about in the Investor Day, supply chain is the kind of last frontier that we're focusing on. And the investments we're making in the West Coast, primarily L.A., that Blake talked about in his script will help further that bending the curve in that cost model."

But I think we're on a good trajectory in terms of what we're focusing on, and that is bearing fruit. So you heard about the strategic brands, and we increasingly have been working in a very kind of collaborative way strategically with that subset of brands to do things, like plan holiday. And for us, that means being the store of choice for gift-giving. We've got a lot of things that we think we can do to improve our gift-giving position, and so we're encouraged about that. One of the things that we've seen that's been a trend for a while that we think will play itself out also through the fourth quarter is just the ongoing casualization of America, and we saw that a lot through the Anniversary time, really, across all classifications. So I think more than anything else, we've kind of learned that the plans that we've had in motion have been validated largely by everything we've seen year-to-date.

We don't really measure the percentage of business done with wear now versus not. That would be pretty difficult to do. I think it just -- part of it's the way, I think, the digital and online part of the business affect it because people can buy things and get instant gratification that way and I think [indiscernible] didn't have to come in and buy things in preparation for several months down the road. They can wait a little bit. So what we used to see when we were all in this business years ago with buyers and merchants on the floor is you get people that would come in during Anniversary Sale and stock up for things in the fall and winter that they had no intention of wearing for a few months. That just doesn't really happen very much anymore. So that's just been a flow evolution that we continue to be on top of. And I think it impacts, obviously, the Designer business. You hear them talk about that, too, that shipping things so early in the season sometimes is difficult. And I think that's where some of the season we're stressing comes in and that it's been easier for everyone to deal with it that way. But we also have the nuance of having businesses in Canada and Florida. So that has its own rhythm, too. Our allocation process is pretty sophisticated and challenging, just given, again, the diversity of our stores. If we want to really maximize the productivity in each location, we've got to be really good at that. And that's -- again, that's the journey that we're on, and it gets improved upon with technology and systems over time."

Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For t",1033,"Good afternoon, everyone. Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For those who missed it, we have made the webcast available on our Investor Relations website. We've laid out the strategy and will continue to build on this foundation as we execute and measure our outcomes. 
Our second quarter results reflect our progress in achieving our long-term financial commitments. In the second quarter, we reported a total sales increase of approximately 7% and earnings per share of $0.95. We remain on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth. As a reminder, over the course of this year, there are timing impacts related to the shift in the calendar and the new revenue recognition standard. In the second quarter, this represented a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points on total sales and $30 million on EBIT. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter, resulting in an unfavorable impact. To help provide further clarity, we posted our slides ahead of this call, and Anne will share additional insights in her remarks.
Because of these nuances on total sales this year, we're also providing color on our comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis with no impacts from the calendar shift or revenue recognition. For the second quarter, comp sales increased 4%, driven by growth across both full-price and off-price. 
We had robust digital sales growth for the quarter, reflecting our market-leading presence and significant progress toward our long-term goals. Digital sales grew 23% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from a year ago and accounted for 34% of our sales. 
In full-price, we had a comp increase of 4.1% for the quarter. We recently completed our one-of-a-kind Anniversary Sale, an event that distinguishes us in the industry by featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Anniversary generates significant volume that rivals even our holiday period. 
We continued to see a heightened shift of customers shopping online during Anniversary. Digital sales accounted for more than 40% of our event. On the first day of Early Access for our Nordstrom cardholders, we had our biggest day ever online, exceeding our previous record by 80% at 10x our average daily demand. We worked hard to manage our systems for peak demand. Despite our efforts, we experienced some website issues as we encountered unprecedented levels of demand on the first day of the event. While our team resolved this, we know we disappointed many of our customers, and in response, we offered cardholders 10 points per dollar on purchases made on the first day of Anniversary. 
While we had a solid Anniversary overall, we're well aware that we have opportunities to better meet our customers' expectations. We've learned a lot and are highly committed to improving our execution. 
From a merchandising perspective, our partnerships with strategic brands enable us to provide customers with compelling offers and strengthen our product margin. In the second quarter, sales from strategic brands grew 13%, making up around 45% of our full-price business. We are positioned to achieve our long-term plans for strategic brand growth that we shared during Investor Day. 
Our off-price business delivered a comp increase of 4% for the second quarter. The strength of our inventory position allowed us to be fluid and respond quickly. We took swift action to accelerate inventory turns, strengthen our core assortment and improve our execution in stores. Our second quarter comp sales exceeded our plan by 200 basis points, and we expect to carry and build upon this momentum during the second half of the year. We also continue to deliver 25%-plus sales gains in our digital business, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. 
One of the primary topics we discussed during our Investor Day was our local market strategy, a cornerstone of how we will win with customers and increase shareholder value. When customers engage with us across stores and online, on average, they spend 5x more and profitability per customer doubles. Through our focus on our top markets, we're combining the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people, product and place to drive increased customer engagement and gain market share. 
We're starting in our largest market, Los Angeles, where we're bringing all of our digital and physical assets together in a seamless ecosystem. We're continuing to invest in supply chain, a critical enabler of the customer experience. We have identified sites for our West Coast fulfillment center and local omni-channel hub, which are scheduled to open in late 2019. These investments in our supply chain network will help us address our opportunities to better serve customers, improve our efficiencies and leverage inventory in our local markets.
Last month, we announced that 2 additional Nordstrom Local concepts will open in the L.A. market this fall. These neighborhood hubs are one component of our local market strategy to engage with customers through more convenient access to products and services, such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, alterations, store reserve and personal styling.
Technology is a critical component of our ambition to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world. On that front, we're pleased that Edmond Mesrobian has joined our executive team as Chief Technology Officer. Edmond brings nearly 3 decades of experience from large and complex international companies, including Tesco and Expedia. He will support all aspects of technology across the company and focus on advancing our capabilities to deliver the best experience to our customers however they choose to shop with us.
In closing, we believe we are leading the future of retail through our customer strategy centered on 3 strategic pillars: Providing a compelling product offering; delivering outstanding services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. We are confident in our path forward and are well-positioned to achieve our financial plans for the year and over the long run.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide more color on our second quarter and expectations for the year."
32215,576185676,1546271,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2018",2018-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns",1085,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns through 3 deliverables: Growing market share; improving profitability and returns; and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach.  Second, we're on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth as we scale our generational investments and digital capabilities.  And third, as our model evolves and we near completion of our heavy investment cycle over the next couple of years, we plan to return to mid-teens ROIC and accelerate free cash flow.
Our second quarter demonstrated our progress in achieving these financial goals. Q2 EPS of $0.95 reflected top line strength across our businesses and throughout the quarter. Based on our first half results, we have raised our full year outlook from a top and bottom line perspective.
Now I'll provide further details around the timing shifts. As Blake mentioned, quarterly comparisons to the prior year are impacted because of last year's 53-week calendar and revenue recognition changes. For the second and third quarters, the primary driver of timing shifts is revenue recognition. The shift of events, Triple Points, Anniversary and Half-Yearly, largely offset within the second and third quarters. For example, in the second quarter, the unfavorable impact of Triple Points was largely offset by the favorable impact of Anniversary. 
For the second quarter, we had a total sales increase of approximately 7%, including a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points, which will fully reverse in the third quarter. This primarily represented the impact of revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary.
As Blake mentioned, comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, which means there are no impacts from event shifts or revenue recognition. While we are providing color on our comp performance given this year's unique nuances, we're focusing on total market and sales performance, as comps become less relevant over time. 
As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we made changes to our sales reporting to align with how we view our results internally. We now allocate certain corporate adjustments, such as estimated sales returns, to our full-price and off-price businesses. These allocation changes do not impact sales at a total company level, but they do impact prior year comparisons for full-price and off-price. 
It's also important to keep in mind that we don't believe our sales trends on a quarter-over-quarter basis are necessarily predictive due to the seasonal nature of our business. For example, Anniversary has become less of an indicator for second half performance, as our merchandise offering continues to shift from fall to wear now. We view our underlying trends over a longer-term horizon, which has generally been consistent over the past several years.
Now I'd like to walk through some timing impacts on the other areas of P&L and provide some color on our Anniversary execution. First, the gross profit increase of approximately 90 basis points included a favorable shift of $30 million due to revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter. More specifically, it represents in-transit sales that are now recognized as shipment under the new standard rather than deferred. There is an elevated impact relative to last year due to the high volume of online sales for Anniversary at the end of the quarter.
The second call-out is related to an unplanned 10-point loyalty offering made in response to the site outage on the first day of Anniversary. This reduced gross profit by approximately $12 million in Q2 and is expected to be roughly EBIT-neutral by the end of the year, as customers redeem their notes. In Q2 last year, we had a similar loyalty accommodation, so the impact is minimal on a year-over-year basis. 
Our gross profit performance reflected higher product margins from continued regular-price selling trends and leverage on occupancy expenses. From an inventory perspective, we ended the quarter with a positive spread between inventory and sales growth, in line with our expectations. 
Moving to SG&A. Our rate increased around 70 basis points over last year. This reflected higher fulfillment and delivery expenses related to digital growth and peak online demand during Anniversary. Coming off the event, we expect supply chain costs to return to recent levels. We're focused on continuing to bend the curve in expense growth and remain on track for a mid-single-digit increase for the year. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our philosophy is to maintain a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. We're also focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. We had approximately $90 million in share repurchases year-to-date. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We've raised our EPS outlook from a range of $3.35 to $3.55 to a range of $3.50 to $3.65. This incorporates our first half results while maintaining our assumptions for the second half of the year. From a comp perspective, we've raised our full year expectations from a 0.5% to 1.5% increase to a 1.5% to 2% increase. This assumes a continuation of underlying sales trends in the second half of the year. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect modest improvement in product margins and a consistent occupancy rate relative to last year.  For the second half of the year, we expect Q3 to contribute roughly 30% of EBIT and Q4 to contribute 70%. 
We have the following quarterly call-outs: Q3 EBIT margin is planned to deleverage on fixed expenses and includes a $30 million unfavorable shift from Q2, associated with the impact of revenue recognition. Q4 EBIT margin is planned to leverage on higher sales volume and reflects a favorable comparison of $16 million from a onetime employee -- investment associated with last year's tax reform. When normalizing for this onetime impact, Q4's planned EBIT contribution in the second half is generally consistent with historical trends. 
We remain confident that 2018 is an inflection point for long-term profitable growth. Our drivers of EBIT margin improvement include continued strength in our product margins, scaling of generational investments and leveraging our digital capabilities. We're encouraged by our progress to date, and we're tracking well against our financial plans.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

And as you'll recall it, it was opportunistic that we could get that space and open it over a year before our main store that will be mostly focused on Women's. So we're learning a lot about operating a men's-only store. We're learning a lot about traffic trends in New York, particularly as summer comes along. But mostly, I think what we're really encouraged by is a lot of the qualitative response we've had from customers, from people in our industry who visited that store, the team we put together there, and we're encouraged by our long-term prospects. So a lot more to come there, particularly next fall, when we get the Tower open, and we'll really be able to have our full offer there and start serving Manhattan in a more robust way. In regards to Canada, this past spring, we opened our first 3 Rack stores in Canada. Those were delayed. We'd hoped to have Rack stores opened earlier than this. And as we shared before, our Rack stores play a really critical role in allowing us to have a great flow of newness in our full-price stores. And so it's nice to get those stores open. I can tell you that we are exceeding expectations in those 3 Rack stores. The team has done a terrific job of getting them open. We've got 3 more opening this fall. And we think that by bringing our Rack business there, along with our full-price business, we'll start to be able to be offering more of the full Nordstrom experience. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to improve our flow of merchandise into Canada, getting it across the border. It's different than shipping within the U.S. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our effectiveness there, and we're encouraged about getting after those opportunities in the back half of this year."

From 2015 to 2017, we bent the curve, and it went down to about 10%. And as we gave guidance for this year and also during the Investor Day, we spent quite a bit of time talking about this as well, is that our guidance on these capabilities is that it's growing at about mid-single digit. So we're continuing to bend the curve on this. I would say that -- and we talked about this in the Investor Day, but the 2 areas that we've already seen leverage in those areas are marketing and technology. And as we talked about in the Investor Day, supply chain is the kind of the last frontier that we're focusing on. And the investments we're making in the West Coast, primarily L.A., that Blake talked about in his script will help further that bending the curve in that cost model."

One of the things that we've seen that's been a trend for a while that we think will play itself out also through the fourth quarter is just the ongoing casualization of America, and we saw that a lot through the Anniversary time, really, across all classifications.

And I think Anne spoke to some of it, how we think it's going to impact us in August. We had this incredible demand. We're going to probably have more returns, too. So that's part of it.

The other thing -- it was remarkably similar how the different divisions performed, more so than normal, but what I would say is some of the things that set the different divisions apart is our regular-price business is really good.

You probably noticed from being in our stores over the years, what we've tried to do is have a more common floor surface with less-defined barriers so that we can contract and expand with different classifications as they're growing. And the Anthropologie example you used is a pretty good one. We don't have particularly large at-home departments, and when we got Anthropologie, that implied some furniture and stuff that went with that. So in many cases, because we have one floor surface on a floor like that, we have some flexibility where we could expand our footprint in at-home, and so we're able to do that in some cases. So we're just trying to keep -- have our whole physical setup be as absolutely nimble and fluid as it possibly can be. Obviously, there's some limitations to that, but that's a theme that we've been on for quite some time and we talk about a lot strategically as a group of merchants, is making sure that we're really funding and chasing the things that are working and then working hand in hand with the stores to make sure that we got the floor space to do that."

So what we used to see when we were all in this business years ago as buyers and merchants on the floor is you get people that would come in during Anniversary Sale and stock up for things in the fall and winter that they had no intention of wearing for a few months. That just doesn't really happen very much anymore. So that's just been a slow evolution that we continue to be on top of. And I think it impacts, obviously, the Designer business. You hear them talk about that, too, that shipping things so early in the season sometimes is difficult. And I think that's where some of the seasonless dressing comes in, that it's been easier for everyone to deal with it that way. But we also have the nuance of having businesses in Canada and Florida. So that has its own rhythm, too. Our allocation process is pretty sophisticated and challenging, just given, again, the diversity of our stores. And we want to really maximize the productivity in each location, we've got to be really good at that.

The only thing it has to do is that in the past, we held reserves for potential returns at total company. And with our segment change, we have now started allocating that out to the segment. So total JWN doesn't change. It's just the timing of when segments would have seen that. So last year, they would have seen that in Q3. This year, we were pushing it and seeing it in Q2. So there is a specific footnote that describes that impact, and I would encourage you to talk to Trina offline about that."

Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For t",1036,"Good afternoon, everyone. Many of you joined us for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate the opportunity to share our customer strategy, our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world and our long-term financial commitments. For those who missed it, we have made the webcast available on our Investor Relations website. We've laid out the strategy and will continue to build on this foundation as we execute and measure our outcomes. 
Our second quarter results reflect our progress in achieving our long-term financial commitments. In the second quarter, we reported a total sales increase of approximately 7% and earnings per share of $0.95. We remain on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth. As a reminder, over the course of this year, there are timing impacts related to the shift in the calendar and the new revenue recognition standard. In the second quarter, this represented a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points on total sales and $30 million on EBIT. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter, resulting in an unfavorable impact. To help provide further clarity, we posted our slides ahead of this call, and Anne will share additional insights in her remarks.
Because of these nuances on total sales this year, we're also providing color on our comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis with no impacts from the calendar shift or revenue recognition. For the second quarter, comp sales increased 4%, driven by growth across both full-price and off-price. 
We had robust digital sales growth for the quarter, reflecting our market-leading presence and significant progress toward our long-term goals. Digital sales grew 23% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from a year ago and accounted for 34% of our sales. 
In full-price, we had a comp increase of 4.1% for the quarter. We recently completed our one-of-a-kind Anniversary Sale, an event that distinguishes us in the industry by featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Anniversary generates significant volume that rivals even our holiday period. 
We continued to see a heightened shift of customers shopping online during Anniversary. Digital sales accounted for more than 40% of our event. On the first day of Early Access for our Nordstrom cardholders, we had our biggest day ever online, exceeding our previous record by 80% at 10x our average daily demand. We worked hard to manage our systems for peak demand. Despite our efforts, we experienced some website issues as we encountered unprecedented levels of demand on the first day of the event. While our team resolved this, we know we disappointed many of our customers, and in response, we offered cardholders 10 points per dollar on purchases made on the first day of Anniversary. 
While we had a solid Anniversary overall, we're well aware that we have opportunities to better meet our customers' expectations. We've learned a lot and are highly committed to improving our execution. 
From a merchandising perspective, our partnerships with strategic brands enable us to provide customers with compelling offers and strengthen our product margin. In the second quarter, sales from strategic brands grew 13%, making up around 45% of our full-price business. We are positioned to achieve our long-term plans for strategic brand growth that we shared during Investor Day. 
Our off-price business delivered a comp increase of 4% for the second quarter. The strength of our inventory position allowed us to be fluid and respond quickly. We took swift action to accelerate inventory turns, strengthen our core assortment and improve our execution in stores. Our second quarter comp sales exceeded our plan by a couple of hundred basis points, and we expect to carry and build upon this momentum during the second half of the year. We also continue to deliver 25%-plus sales gains in our digital business, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. 
One of the primary topics we discussed during our Investor Day was our local market strategy, a cornerstone of how we will win with customers and increase shareholder value. When customers engage with us across stores and online, on average, they spend 5x more and profitability per customer doubles. Through our focus on our top markets, we're combining the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people, product and place to drive increased customer engagement and gain market share. 
We're starting in our largest market, Los Angeles, where we're bringing all of our digital and physical assets together in a seamless ecosystem. We're continuing to invest in supply chain, a critical enabler of the customer experience. We have identified sites for our West Coast fulfillment center and local omni-channel hub, which are scheduled to open in late 2019. These investments in our supply chain network will help us address our opportunities to better serve customers, improve our efficiencies and leverage inventory in our local markets.
Last month, we announced that 2 additional Nordstrom Local concepts will open in the L.A. market this fall. These neighborhood hubs are one component of our local market strategy to engage with customers through more convenient access to products and services, such as Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, alterations, store reserve and personal styling.
Technology is a critical component of our ambition to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world. On that front, we're pleased that Edmond Mesrobian has joined our executive team as Chief Technology Officer. Edmond brings nearly 3 decades of experience from large and complex international companies, including Tesco and Expedia. He will support all aspects of technology across the company and focus on advancing our capabilities to deliver the best experience to our customers however they choose to shop with us.
In closing, we believe we are leading the future of retail through our customer strategy centered on 3 strategic pillars: Providing a compelling product offering; delivering outstanding services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. We are confident in our path forward and are well-positioned to achieve our financial plans for the year and over the long run.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide more color on our second quarter and expectations for the year."
32215,576185676,1546606,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2018",2018-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns",1085,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our key takeaways from our recent Investor Day regarding our long-term financial plan. To begin with, we're targeting higher shareholder returns through 3 deliverables: Growing market share; improving profitability and returns; and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach.  Second, we're on track for 2018 to be an inflection point for profitable growth as we scale our generational investments and digital capabilities.  And third, as our model evolves and we near completion of our heavy investment cycle over the next couple of years, we plan to return to mid-teens ROIC and accelerate free cash flow.
Our second quarter demonstrated our progress in achieving these financial goals. Q2 EPS of $0.95 reflected top line strength across our businesses and throughout the quarter. Based on our first half results, we have raised our full year outlook from a top and bottom line perspective.
Now I'll provide further details around the timing shifts. As Blake mentioned, quarterly comparisons to the prior year are impacted because of last year's 53-week calendar and revenue recognition changes. For the second and third quarters, the primary driver of timing shifts is revenue recognition. The shift of events, Triple Points, Anniversary and Half-Yearly, largely offset within the second and third quarters. For example, in the second quarter, the unfavorable impact of Triple Points was largely offset by the favorable impact of Anniversary. 
For the second quarter, we had a total sales increase of approximately 7%, including a favorable impact of roughly 100 basis points, which will fully reverse in the third quarter. This primarily represented the impact of revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary.
As Blake mentioned, comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, which means there are no impacts from event shifts or revenue recognition. While we are providing color on our comp performance given this year's unique nuances, we're focusing on total market and sales performance, as comps become less relevant over time. 
As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we made changes to our sales reporting to align with how we view our results internally. We now allocate certain corporate adjustments, such as estimated sales returns, to our full-price and off-price businesses. These allocation changes do not impact sales at a total company level, but they do impact prior year comparisons for full-price and off-price. 
It's also important to keep in mind that we don't believe our sales trends on a quarter-over-quarter basis are necessarily predictive due to the seasonal nature of our business. For example, Anniversary has become less of an indicator for second half performance, as our merchandise offering continues to shift from fall to wear now. We view our underlying trends over a longer-term horizon, which has generally been consistent over the past several years.
Now I'd like to walk through some timing impacts on the other areas of P&L and provide some color on our Anniversary execution. First, the gross profit increase of approximately 90 basis points included a favorable shift of $30 million due to revenue recognition as it relates to the timing of Anniversary. This is expected to fully reverse in the third quarter. More specifically, it represents in-transit sales that are now recognized as shipment under the new standard rather than deferred. There is an elevated impact relative to last year due to the high volume of online sales for Anniversary at the end of the quarter.
The second call-out is related to an unplanned 10-point loyalty offering made in response to the site outage on the first day of Anniversary. This reduced gross profit by approximately $12 million in Q2 and is expected to be roughly EBIT-neutral by the end of the year, as customers redeem their notes. In Q2 last year, we had a similar loyalty accommodation, so the impact is minimal on a year-over-year basis. 
Our gross profit performance reflected higher product margins from continued regular-price selling trends and leverage on occupancy expenses. From an inventory perspective, we ended the quarter with a positive spread between inventory and sales growth, in line with our expectations. 
Moving to SG&A. Our rate increased around 70 basis points over last year. This reflected higher fulfillment and delivery expenses related to digital growth and peak online demand during Anniversary. Coming off the event, we expect supply chain costs to return to recent levels. We're focused on continuing to bend the curve in expense growth and remain on track for a mid-single-digit increase for the year. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our philosophy is to maintain a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. We're also focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. We had approximately $90 million in share repurchases year-to-date. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We've raised our EPS outlook from a range of $3.35 to $3.55 to a range of $3.50 to $3.65. This incorporates our first half results while maintaining our assumptions for the second half of the year. From a comp perspective, we've raised our full year expectations from a 0.5% to 1.5% increase to a 1.5% to 2% increase. This assumes a continuation of underlying sales trends in the second half of the year. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect modest improvement in product margins and a consistent occupancy rate relative to last year.  For the second half of the year, we expect Q3 to contribute roughly 30% of EBIT and Q4 to contribute 70%. 
We have the following quarterly call-outs: Q3 EBIT margin is planned to deleverage on fixed expenses and includes a $30 million unfavorable shift from Q2, associated with the impact of revenue recognition. Q4 EBIT margin is planned to leverage on higher sales volume and reflects a favorable comparison of $16 million from a onetime employee -- investment associated with last year's tax reform. When normalizing for this onetime impact, Q4's planned EBIT contribution in the second half is generally consistent with historical trends. 
We remain confident that 2018 is an inflection point for long-term profitable growth. Our drivers of EBIT margin improvement include continued strength in our product margins, scaling of generational investments and leveraging our digital capabilities. We're encouraged by our progress to date, and we're tracking well against our financial plans.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

And we alluded at the Investor Day that we felt that we were heavy with our inventories, and he's been able to, with the team, take some inventory back of the house. And so it's about $85 million less on a comp store basis in our stores, yet we don't think it's changed what's happening in front of the house.

But mostly, I think what we're really encouraged by is a lot of the qualitative response we've had from customers, from people in our industry who visited that store, the team we put together there, and we're encouraged by our long-term prospects. So a lot more to come there, particularly next fall, when we get the Tower open, and we'll really be able to have our full offer there and start serving Manhattan in a more robust way. In regards to Canada, this past spring, we opened our first 3 Rack stores in Canada. Those were delayed. We'd hoped to have Rack stores opened earlier than this. And as we shared before, our Rack stores play a really critical role in allowing us to have a great flow of newness in our full-price stores. And so it's nice to get those stores open. I can tell you that we are exceeding expectations in those 3 Rack stores. The team has done a terrific job of getting them open. We've got 3 more opening this fall. And we think that by bringing our Rack business there, along with our full-price business, we'll start to be able to be offering more of the full Nordstrom experience.

So if you look at the investments that we started making back in 2010, 2012, our investments in those 3 key capabilities, which is marketing, technology and supply chain, were growing at 20%, so there was a high-growth and high-investment period. From 2015 to 2017, we bent the curve, and it went down to about 10%. And as we gave guidance for this year and also during the Investor Day, we spent quite a bit of time talking about this as well, is that our guidance on these capabilities is that it's growing at about mid-single digit. So we're continuing to bend the curve on this. I would say that -- and we talked about this in the Investor Day, but the 2 areas that we've already seen leverage in those areas are marketing and technology. And as we talked about in the Investor Day, supply chain is the kind of the last frontier that we're focusing on. And the investments we're making in the West Coast, primarily L.A., that Blake talked about in his script will help further that bending the curve in that cost model."

But I think we're on a good trajectory in terms of what we're focusing on, and that is bearing fruit. So you heard about the strategic brands, and we increasingly have been working in a very kind of collaborative way strategically with that subset of brands to do things, like plan holiday. And for us, that means being the store of choice for gift-giving. We've got a lot of things that we think we can do to improve our gift-giving position, and so we're encouraged about that. One of the things that we've seen that's been a trend for a while that we think will play itself out also through the fourth quarter is just the ongoing casualization of America, and we saw that a lot through the Anniversary time, really, across all classifications. So I think more than anything else, we've kind of learned that the plans that we've had in motion have been validated largely by everything we've seen year-to-date. And then I think lastly, given the fact that our inventories are in relatively good shape and we're in a position where we can react, I think we feel like we're in a good position for the fourth quarter."

A lot of those customers are coming in having already decided what they want to buy, because they've been shopping on our website, or they're coming in to get alterations on something they bought on Nordstrom.com or any number of different versions of a digital-to-in-store experience. And so part of our big opportunity is looking at our stores and figuring out how do we need to evolve the staffing model, the layout, the services and experiences that we offer in those stores to continue to be relevant to that customer who spends some time shopping on our website. When they come into the store, is their experience matching what their expectations are? And so that's a big focus of ours in Los Angeles. But for all of our major markets, we know that that's what the customer expects, and that's where our focus is."

You probably noticed from being in our stores over the years, what we've tried to do is have a more common floor surface with less-defined barriers so that we can contract and expand with different classifications as they're growing. And the Anthropologie example you used is a pretty good one. We don't have particularly large at-home departments, and when we got Anthropologie, that implied some furniture and stuff that went with that. So in many cases, because we have one floor surface on a floor like that, we have some flexibility where we could expand our footprint in at-home, and so we're able to do that in some cases. So we're just trying to keep -- have our whole physical setup be as absolutely nimble and fluid as it possibly can be. Obviously, there's some limitations to that, but that's a theme that we've been on for quite some time and we talk about a lot strategically as a group of merchants, is making sure that we're really funding and chasing the things that are working and then working hand in hand with the stores to make sure that we got the floor space to do that."

So what we used to see when we were all in this business years ago as buyers and merchants on the floor is you get people that would come in during Anniversary Sale and stock up for things in the fall and winter that they had no intention of wearing for a few months. That just doesn't really happen very much anymore. So that's just been a slow evolution that we continue to be on top of. And I think it impacts, obviously, the Designer business. You hear them talk about that, too, that shipping things so early in the season sometimes is difficult. And I think that's where some of the seasonless dressing comes in, that it's been easier for everyone to deal with it that way. But we also have the nuance of having businesses in Canada and Florida. So that has its own rhythm, too. Our allocation process is pretty sophisticated and challenging, just given, again, the diversity of our stores. And we want to really maximize the productivity in each location, we've got to be really good at that.

That definitely played a big role in our marketing plan."

We're focused on our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world through our 3 strategic pillars: one, providing a compelling product offering; two, delivering exceptional services and experiences; and three, leveraging the strength of our Nordstrom brand. 
For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength in our full-price and off-price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. 
Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 e-commerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made up 30% of our business.
Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I'd like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action, including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again. We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realize customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us, and that's a responsibility we take seriously. 
Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.
Looking ahead, we're scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. 
We continued our expansion into Canada with 3 additional Racks: in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our 6 Rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations. We expect further synergies from having a full-price and off-price presence in this market. 
Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our Men's Store. We're building on our initial earnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women's store opening planned in fall 2019. 
Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory, along with our digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We're back on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement and improved profitability.
Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers a significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that's available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in Buy Online and Pick Up in Store. This is a great example of how we're leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. 
Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by 4 to 7x for product available same or next day in a given market. To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omnichannel hub next year. These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies, and more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster.
Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs, provide customers with more convenient access to our services. A year ago, we opened our first Nordstrom Local in West Hollywood. Encouraged by our initial results, we recently introduced 2 additional locations: in Brentwood and Downtown Los Angeles. 
In addition to service and convenience, providing newness is an integral part of our merchandising efforts. Our strategic brand partnerships enable us to offer compelling products to customers and strengthen our product margin. In the third quarter, our strategic brand made up roughly 45% of our full-priced sales. 
Our partnerships with influencers are an important way we're creating inspiration and a sense of discovery for customers. Following a successful launch last fall, we partnered with Arielle Charnas to introduce a new standalone brand, Something Navy. Additionally, we launched a collaboration between Atlantic Pacific and our private label brand, Halogen. Both product launches outperformed our expectations. 
We're also leveraging the Nordstrom brand to drive increased customer engagement. We know that when customers engage with us across various touch points, both their trips and spend increase. Our robust loyalty program gives us the opportunity to serve customers in a more personalized way. We have more than 11 million loyalty customers contributing 56% of year-to-date sales, an increase of roughly 15% over last year. 
Last month, we launched the Nordy Club, an evolution of our loyalty program that offers enhanced services and experiences and a faster earn rate for credit card members. While it's still early, we're encouraged by the uptick in enrollment trend. We look forward to building on the connections our customers have with our brand through the Nordy Club.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on establishing Nordstrom as the gift-giving destination and making it more convenient to shop. We're well positioned to improve the customer experience and believe our combination of digital capabilities and local market assets, our people, product and place, make us uniquely positioned for success in the market.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional insights into our results."

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge. 
As Blake mentioned, in a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. This occurred as a result of settings implemented in 2010. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We are currently assessing the impact to each individual account and will communicate directly with impacted cardholders. We estimated nonrecurring costs of $72 million or $0.28 in EPS, primarily representing refunds and other fees, which we recorded in SG&A in the third quarter.
Excluding this charge, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year. We're focused on 3 key deliverables to increase shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. 
Starting with our first deliverable, continuing market share gains. Our third quarter reflected consistent underlying sales trends. As you may recall, we know the timing considerations that impact year-over-year comparisons, including the new revenue recognition standard and shift resulting from last year's 53rd-week calendar. We reported third quarter total sales growth of 3%, which included an unfavorable timing impact of roughly 100 basis points from Q2. As a reminder, this primarily represented in-transit sales that were recognized as shipment under the new revenue accounting standard rather than deferred. At the end of the second quarter, there was an elevated impact due to the high volume of online anniversary sales. 
Given these timing considerations, we're continuing to provide color on comparable sales, which are aligned with the 53rd-week calendar in 2017. 
In full-price, underlying trends were consistent and in line with our expectations. This reflected ongoing strength of strategic brands, which grew 8% over last year. The full-price comp increase of 0.4% was impacted by planned anniversary turns from last quarter. To normalize for this, Q2 and Q3 combined full-price comps increased by 2.5% compared to flat comp growth last year. 
We're pleased with the momentum in our off-price business, which delivered a comp sales gain of 5.8% and exceeded our expectations across all merchandise divisions. This reflected our focused efforts throughout the year to accelerate inventory turns and strengthen our merchandise assortment.
Moving to our second key deliverable of improving profitability and returns. Generational investments are continuing to scale. These investments contributed approximately half of our year-to-date net sales increase. We're tracking against our expectations for 2018, which we shared at the beginning of the year. Generational investments are expected to deliver $1.8 billion in sales and achieve our EBIT plan. 
Our strength in product margin is another driver of long-term profitable growth. For the year, we remain on track for product margins to be flat or slightly up. Third quarter gross profit decreased 137 basis points from last year, and this was primarily due to timing, including Q2's revenue recognition impact of $30 million, in addition to off-price mix. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 19 basis points, consistent with our expectations. This reflected flat product margins and occupancy rate, offset by the mix from off-price growth.
Ending inventory increased 7% over last year, primarily due to timing associated with holiday. We pulled forward receipts to set holiday product earlier as part of our strategy. In addition, we had higher inventories in-transit due to the end of the quarter shifting 1 week closer to holiday relative to last year. Excluding this timing impact, Q3 inventory growth approximated sales growth. We expect to end the year with inventories in line with sales growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our SG&A rate was generally flat to last year. This reflected ongoing progress in bending the curve in expense growth. Our digital capabilities in marketing, technology and supply chain are critical enablers of the customer experience.
Through productivity improvements, we expect moderate expense growth for our digital capabilities to mid-single-digits this year compared with 10% annual growth over the last couple of years. Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our overall SG&A grew 6% year-to-date, on track for mid-single-digit growth for the year. 
Our third key deliverable is maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our long-term philosophy is to have a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $640 million and free cash flow of around $250 million. In August, our board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and we repurchased $70 million in the third quarter.
Turning to our full year expectations. We updated our annual EPS outlook to incorporate third quarter results, raising the low end of our range by $0.05 when excluding the nonrecurring charge. From a top line perspective, we are assuming a continuation of underlying trends with a comp increase of approximately 2% for the year compared with our prior outlook of 1.5% to 2%. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, we expect leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of fewer Rack store openings. We will also lap a onetime employee investment of $16 million associated with last year's tax reform.
To wrap up, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year when excluding the nonrecurring charge. We remain focused on strengthening our product margins, scaling our generational investments and improving our expense efficiencies. We are well positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.

So in general, the way that we are giving guidance for the full year, and I think you can kind of back into it, we don't typically give guidance for between full-price and off-price. But I will say this, we set the total JWN comp guidance, it was really then with consistent trends that we see in the business over time. So if you -- we gave a comp guidance of 2% for the full year -- approximately 2%. I think if you look at underlying trends in both businesses, you can kind of back into what Q4's sitting at is pretty much aligned with what we've seen for the rest of the year. As far as the margin components to it, as we talked about, we're expecting to get product margin to be flat to slightly up, and we're expecting to give some leverage out of our occupancy expense. And we believe, and kind of back into Q4, but based on our guidance, it would infer that we have are at inflection point for the year as far as the EBIT rate."

In terms of holiday receipts, we tried to signal that in the last quarter's call. But as was pointed out in both Anne's and my comments, there was some timing factors, but we also felt it was important to be in a strong position as we got into the holiday season. There's a 1-week change with the holiday this year. But we've seen -- your question was if you've seen any outcomes from it. No question, last month, we saw some reaction to cold weather, so starting with outerwear and boots. So we feel optimistic about this holiday season. We've worked hard to take the friction out for the customer experience. And we want to be a destination for gift-giving, and that requires having the right product and being in-stock and adding that inventory where their demand is for the customer. So our merchandising team is really taking to heart both last year and previous year's holidays results and has made some adjustments to it. We think we're in a good position there. But again, we also try to convey that inventory management's important. We've managed inventories well throughout the year. We don't want that signal to be mixed because we fully intend to continue to have our inventories in line. The last question you had was regarding fulfillment. It's such a key component of our strategy and to take care of the customer. So fulfillment, years ago, was done in bulk and just from a store point of view. And now it's about niches. It's about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it. And our fulfillment centers outside of our distribution centers are based on the Midwest and East Coast. We do a lot of business on the West Coast and specifically Southern California. So we were challenged in terms of our delivery times to be able to service those customers. We've made a significant investment for a local omni hub there and 2 facilities to be able to not only take care of fulfillment, the stores, full-price and off-price, but to be able to service the customer that we're aspiring to do through our Nordstrom Local efforts and which we are embarking on in L.A. So a key component of being able to execute Nordstrom Local is improving the supply chain, and we've certainly made a significant investment along those lines. And that hopefully will bear fruit over the next 24 months."

Are we able to have newness to the customer, a curated and balanced buy? And when we get overbought, we get choked up, it puts a real pressure on the margins, and it affects that newness. It's particularly true in off-price, our ability to be in the market and be able to respond more tightly to the customer feedback we're getting. In all of 2017, we found ourselves on the other side of that ledger. So this past year, our merchandising team, which we're really proud of, they've worked really hard to get their inventories in line and to work on that balance and flow. And we really think the results are a reflection of those efforts. Also, we'd point out, we're very unique, and we feel very fortunate to have a very strong digital off-price business. Most of our competition doesn't have that. It's how the customer wants to shop. And just like in full-price, we view it collectively. So that 5.8% was driven in large part through the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, with the Rack size of the business being a little bit flatter in silos. But we don't look at that way, and the customer doesn't look at that, that way. It's very seamless for the customer wants to buy and return the merchandise between those 2 channels, and we want to continue to get to work on that. And again, that's how the customer wants to shop with us."

For the Q3, again, revenue recognition as well as a lot of other timing adjustments associated with it, which is why we are looking at this more of a year-to-date basis. And then you had a higher mix of off-price, which is full-price, which had a little bit of a margin impact for the quarter as well. So it's really a lot of it is just timing-related. And that's why we start to give additional color for the year-to-date where we are as well as where we are for the full year so that you can kind of see very much in line with our expectations in the guidance we've been giving. As far as full-price for the comp, the reason why we're talking about Q2, Q3 together is because of the impact of the Anniversary Sale shift in the calendar and with the returns coming in, in the third quarter. So when we look at a 2.5% comp, we're actually pretty pleased with where that landed. And as far as the 0.4, it's pretty much in line with our expectations. I think, from a traffic perspective, what we have seen from a full-price business for the quarter is it's been really consistent trends with traffic growth when you look at both our digital and physical combined."

We've had various programs over the years to enhance the loyalty experience, and the Nordy Club is just another step along those lines. We've only got about 30 days under our belt. But as I indicated in my remarks, we're getting some really positive feedback. We see that through just the adoption in the Nordstrom app. It's up considerably. We now have the ability to get the rewards or points back to the customer quicker we're able to communicate closer with the customer. We had 4 levels before now. Now we have 5. We're able to again, in a more personalized way, support our most loyal customers. As I mentioned, it's 56% of our sales, and we've seen at 15% gain. We think the Nordy Club is a step along those lines. In terms of the margin, we don't see a material change, particularly this year, as we're just getting started. So there's some startup costs and then plus the gains with the sales, we think it's going to be relatively neutral from a bottom line point of view.

We're focused on our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world through our 3 strategic pillars: one, providing a compelling product offering; two, delivering exceptional services and experiences; and three, leveraging the strength of our Nordstrom brand. 
For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength in our full-price and off-price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. 
Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 e-commerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made up 30% of our business.
Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I'd like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action, including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again. We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realize customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us, and that's a responsibility we take seriously. 
Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.
Looking ahead, we're scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. 
We continued our expansion into Canada with 3 additional Racks: in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our 6 Rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations. We expect further synergies from having a full-price and off-price presence in this market. 
Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our Men's Store. We're building on our initial learnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women's store opening planned in fall 2019. 
Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory, along with our digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We're on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement and improved profitability.
Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers a significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that's available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in Buy Online and Pick Up in Store. This is a great example of how we're leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. 
Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by 4 to 7x for product available same or next day in a given market. To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omnichannel hub next year. These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies, and more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster.
Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs, provide customers with more convenient access to our services. A year ago, we opened our first Nordstrom Local in West Hollywood. Encouraged by our initial results, we recently introduced 2 additional locations: in Brentwood and downtown Los Angeles. 
In addition to service and convenience, providing newness is an integral part of our merchandising efforts. Our strategic brand partnerships enable us to offer compelling products to customers and strengthen our product margin. In the third quarter, our strategic brand made up roughly 45% of our full-priced sales. 
Our partnerships with influencers are an important way we're creating inspiration and a sense of discovery for customers. Following a successful launch last fall, we partnered with Arielle Charnas to introduce a new stand-alone brand, Something Navy. Additionally, we launched a collaboration between Atlantic-Pacific and our private label brand, Halogen. Both product launches outperformed our expectations. 
We're also leveraging the Nordstrom brand to drive increased customer engagement. We know that when customers engage with us across various touch points, both their trips and spend increase. Our robust loyalty program gives us the opportunity to serve customers in a more personalized way. We have more than 11 million loyalty customers contributing 56% of year-to-date sales, an increase of roughly 15% over last year. 
Last month, we launched The Nordy Club, an evolution of our loyalty program that offers enhanced services and experiences and a faster earn rate for credit card members. While it's still early, we're encouraged by the uptick in enrollment trends. We look forward to building on the connections our customers have with our brand through The Nordy Club.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on establishing Nordstrom as the gift-giving destination and making it more convenient to shop. We're well positioned to improve the customer experience and believe our combination of digital capabilities and local market assets, our people, product and place, make us uniquely positioned for success in the market.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional insights into our results."

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge. 
As Blake mentioned, in a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. This occurred as a result of settings implemented in 2010. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We are currently assessing the impact to each individual account and will communicate directly with impacted cardholders. We estimated nonrecurring costs of $72 million or $0.28 in EPS, primarily representing refunds and other fees, which we recorded in SG&A in the third quarter.
Excluding this charge, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year. We're focused on 3 key deliverables to increase shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. 
Starting with our first deliverable, continuing market share gains. Our third quarter reflected consistent underlying sales trends. As you may recall, we know the timing considerations that impact year-over-year comparisons, including the new revenue recognition standard and event shift, resulting from last year's 53rd-week calendar. We reported third quarter total sales growth of 3%, which included an unfavorable timing impact of roughly 100 basis points from Q2. As a reminder, this primarily represented in-transit sales that were recognized as shipment under the new revenue accounting standard rather than deferred. At the end of the second quarter, there was an elevated impact due to the high volume of online anniversary sales. Given these timing considerations, we're continuing to provide color on comparable sales, which are aligned with the 53rd-week calendar in 2017. 
In full-price, underlying trends were consistent and in line with our expectations. This reflected ongoing strength of strategic brands, which grew 8% over last year. The full-price comp increase of 0.4% was impacted by planned anniversary turns from last quarter. To normalize for this, Q2 and Q3 combined full-price comps increased by 2.5% compared to flat comp growth last year. 
We're pleased with the momentum in our off-price business, which delivered a comp sales gain of 5.8% and exceeded our expectations across all merchandise divisions. This reflected our focused efforts throughout the year to accelerate inventory turns and strengthen our merchandise assortment.
Moving to our second key deliverable of improving profitability and returns. Generational investments are continuing to scale. These investments contributed approximately half of our year-to-date net sales increase. We're tracking against our expectations for 2018, which we shared at the beginning of the year. Generational investments are expected to deliver $1.8 billion in sales and achieve our EBIT plan. 
Our strength in product margin is another driver of long-term profitable growth. For the year, we remain on track for product margins to be flat or slightly up. Third quarter gross profit decreased 137 basis points from last year, and this was primarily due to timing, including Q2's revenue recognition impact of $30 million, in addition to off-price mix. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 19 basis points, consistent with our expectations. This reflected flat product margins and occupancy rate, offset by the mix from off-price growth.
Ending inventory increased 7% over last year, primarily due to timing associated with holiday. We pulled forward receipts to set holiday product earlier as part of our strategy. In addition, we had higher inventories in-transit due to the end of the quarter, shifting 1 week closer to holiday relative to last year. Excluding this timing impact, Q3 inventory growth approximated sales growth. We expect to end the year with inventories in line with sales growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our SG&A rate was generally flat to last year. This reflected ongoing progress in bending the curve in expense growth. Our digital capabilities in marketing, technology and supply chain are critical enablers of the customer experience.
Through productivity improvements, we expect moderate expense growth for our digital capabilities to mid-single-digits this year compared with 10% annual growth over the last couple of years. Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our overall SG&A grew 6% year-to-date, on track for mid-single-digit growth for the year. 
Our third key deliverable is maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our long-term philosophy is to have a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $640 million and free cash flow of around $250 million. In August, our board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and we repurchased $70 million in the third quarter.
Turning to our full year expectations. We updated our annual EPS outlook to incorporate third quarter results, raising the low end of our range by $0.05 when excluding the nonrecurring charge. From a top line perspective, we are assuming a continuation of underlying trends with a comp increase of approximately 2% for the year compared with our prior outlook of 1.5% to 2%. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, we expect leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of fewer Rack store openings. We will also lap a onetime employee investment of $16 million associated with last year's tax reform.
To wrap up, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year when excluding the nonrecurring charge. We remain focused on strengthening our product margins, scaling our generational investments and improving our expense efficiencies. We are well positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So in general, the way that we are giving guidance for the full year, I think you can kind of back into it, we don't typically give guidance for between full-price and off-price. But I will say this, we set the total JWN comp guidance. It was really then with consistent trends that we see in the business over time. So if you -- we gave a comp guidance of 2% for the full year -- approximately 2%. I think if you look at underlying trends in both businesses, you can kind of back into what Q4's sitting at is pretty much in line with what we've seen for the rest of the year. As far as the margin components to it, as we talked about, we're expecting to get product margin to be flat to slightly up, and we're expecting to get some leverage out of our occupancy expense. And we believe, and kind of back into Q4, but based on our guidance, it would infer that we are at inflection point for the year as far as the EBIT rate."

In terms of holiday receipts, we tried to signal that in the last quarter's call. But as was pointed out in both Anne's and my comments, there was some timing factors, but we also felt it was important to be in a strong position as we got into the holiday season. There's a 1-week change with the holiday this year. But we've seen -- your question was if you've seen any outcomes from it. No question, last month, we saw some reaction to cold weather, so starting with outerwear and boots. So we feel optimistic about this holiday season. We've worked hard to take the friction out for the customer experience. And we want to be a destination for gift-giving, and that requires having the right product and being in-stock and adding that inventory where their demand is for the customer. So our merchandising team has really taken to heart both last year and previous year's holidays results and have made some adjustments to it. We think we're in a good position there. But again, we also try to convey that inventory management's important. We've managed inventories well throughout the year. We don't want that signal to be mixed because we fully intend to continue to have our inventories in line. The last question you had was regarding fulfillment. It's such a key component of our strategy and the ability to take care of the customer. So fulfillment, years ago, was done in bulk and just from a store point of view. And now it's about niches. It's about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it. And our fulfillment centers outside of our distribution centers are based on the Midwest and the East Coast. We do a lot of business on the West Coast and specifically Southern California. So we were challenged in terms of our delivery times to be able to service those customers. We've made a significant investment for a local omni hub there and 2 facilities to be able to not only take care of fulfillment, the stores, full-price and off-price, but to be able to service the customer that we're aspiring to do through our Nordstrom Local efforts and which we are embarking on in L.A. So a key component of being able to execute Nordstrom Local is improving the supply chain, and we've certainly made a significant investment along those lines. And that hopefully will bear fruit over the next 24 months."

Are we able to have newness to the customer, a curated and balanced buy? And when we get overbought, we get choked up, it puts a real pressure on the margins, and it affects that newness. It's particularly true in off-price, our ability to be in the market and be able to respond more timely to the customer feedback we're getting. And all of 2017, we found ourselves on the other side of that ledger. So this past year, our merchandising team, which we're really proud of, they've worked really hard to get their inventories in line and to work on that balance and flow. And we really think the results are a reflection of those efforts. Also, we'd point out, we're very unique, and we feel very fortunate to have a very strong digital off-price business. Most of our competition doesn't have that. It's how the customer wants to shop. And just like in full-price, we view it collectively. So that 5.8% was driven in large part through the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, with the Rack size of the business being a little bit flatter in silos. But we don't look at that way, and the customer doesn't look at that way. It's very seamless for how the customer wants to buy and return the merchandise between those 2 channels, and we want to continue to get to work on that. And again, that's how the customer wants to shop with us."

For the Q3, again, we have revenue recognition as well as a lot of other timing adjustments associated with it, which is why we are looking at this more of a year-to-date basis. And then you had a higher mix of off-price versus full-price, which had a little bit of a margin impact for the quarter as well. So it's really a lot of it is just timing-related. And that's why we start to give additional color for the year-to-date where we are as well as where we are going to land for the full year so that you can kind of see we're very much in line with our expectations in the guidance we've been giving. As far as full-price for the comp, the reason why we're talking about Q2, Q3 together is because of the impact of the Anniversary Sale shift in the calendar and with the returns coming in, in the third quarter. So when we look at a 2.5% comp, we're actually pretty pleased with where that landed. And as far as the 0.4, it's pretty much in line with our expectations. I think, from a traffic perspective, what we have seen from a full-price business for the quarter is it's been really consistent trends with traffic growth when you look at both our digital and physical combined."

We now have the ability to get the rewards or points back to the customer quicker. We're able to communicate closer with the customer. We had 4 levels before now. Now we have 5. We're able to, again, in a more personalized way, support our most loyal customers. As I mentioned, it's 56% of our sales, and we've seen at 15% gain. We think The Nordy Club is a step along those lines. In terms of the margin, we don't see a material change, particularly this year, as we're just getting started.

Does the issue you discovered have any implications on your go-forward expectations on the earnings for the credit segment?"

And then on the expense side, there are puts and takes, and we look at ways to make sure we're delivering on that productivity initiatives. So overall, I think we're pretty much in line with what we thought beginning of the year as far as how we're going to land the year. As far as the credit charge, we don't believe that it's going to have much of an impact to the total credit guidance. In fact, we didn't change our guidance this quarter for credit revenue."

And again, it's pretty small, so it's really about identified cardholders with delinquent accounts that we are being charged the higher interest in error. And it's less than 4% of our cardholders. So I think it's understanding the materiality of it. Having said that, we certainly do not like having this happen with our customers, and we are very sorry that it took place. As far as the inventory and gross margin, if you go back to my comments from the call, and we really -- we feel like we're in line with our expectations, and we feel like we're going to deliver the gross margin for the full year. We certainly believe inventories will be in line with sales. This is more of a timing. And certainly, in our merch margins, we expect to be flat to slightly up as we finish the year as well. And really the big piece was the occupancy which we should get some leverage on in Q4."

We're focused on our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world through our 3 strategic pillars: one, providing a compelling product offering; two, delivering exceptional services and experiences; and three, leveraging the strength of our Nordstrom brand. 
For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength in our full-price and off-price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. 
Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 e-commerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made up 30% of our business.
Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I'd like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action, including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again. We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realize customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us, and that's a responsibility we take seriously. 
Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.
Looking ahead, we're scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. 
We continued our expansion into Canada with 3 additional Racks: in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our 6 Rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations. We expect further synergies from having a full-price and off-price presence in this market. 
Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our Men's Store. We're building on our initial learnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women's store opening planned in fall 2019. 
Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory, along with our digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We're on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement and improved profitability.
Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers a significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that's available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in Buy Online and Pick Up in Store. This is a great example of how we're leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. 
Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by 4x to 7x for product available same or next day in a given market. To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omnichannel hub next year. These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies, and more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster.
Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs, provide customers with more convenient access to our services. A year ago, we opened our first Nordstrom Local in West Hollywood. Encouraged by our initial results, we recently introduced 2 additional locations: in Brentwood and downtown Los Angeles. 
In addition to service and convenience, providing newness is an integral part of our merchandising efforts. Our strategic brand partnerships enable us to offer compelling products to customers and strengthen our product margin. In the third quarter, our strategic brands made up roughly 45% of our full-priced sales. 
Our partnerships with influencers are an important way we're creating inspiration and a sense of discovery for customers. Following a successful launch last fall, we partnered with Arielle Charnas to introduce a new stand-alone brand, Something Navy. Additionally, we launched a collaboration between Atlantic-Pacific and our private label brand, Halogen. Both product launches outperformed our expectations. 
We're also leveraging the Nordstrom brand to drive increased customer engagement. We know that when customers engage with us across various touch points, both their trips and spend increase. Our robust loyalty program gives us the opportunity to serve customers in a more personalized way. We have more than 11 million loyalty customers contributing 56% of year-to-date sales, an increase of roughly 15% over last year. 
Last month, we launched The Nordy Club, an evolution of our loyalty program that offers enhanced services and experiences and a faster earn rate for credit card members. While it's still early, we're encouraged by the uptick in enrollment trends. We look forward to building on the connections our customers have with our brand through The Nordy Club.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on establishing Nordstrom as the gift-giving destination and making it more convenient to shop. We're well positioned to improve the customer experience and believe our combination of digital capabilities and local market assets, our people, product and place, make us uniquely positioned for success in the market.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional insights into our results."

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge.

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge. 
As Blake mentioned, in a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. This occurred as a result of settings implemented in 2010. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We are currently assessing the impact to each individual account and will communicate directly with impacted cardholders. We estimated nonrecurring costs of $72 million or $0.28 in EPS, primarily representing refunds and other fees, which we recorded in SG&A in the third quarter.
Excluding this charge, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year. We're focused on 3 key deliverables to increase shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. 
Starting with our first deliverable, continuing market share gains. Our third quarter reflected consistent underlying sales trends. As you may recall, we know the timing considerations that impact year-over-year comparisons, including the new revenue recognition standard and event shifts, resulting from last year's 53rd-week calendar. We reported third quarter total sales growth of 3%, which included an unfavorable timing impact of roughly 100 basis points from Q2. As a reminder, this primarily represented in-transit sales that were recognized as shipment under the new revenue accounting standard rather than deferred. At the end of the second quarter, there was an elevated impact due to the high volume of online anniversary sales. Given these timing considerations, we're continuing to provide color on comparable sales, which are aligned with the 53rd-week calendar in 2017. 
In full-price, underlying trends were consistent and in line with our expectations. This reflected ongoing strength of strategic brands, which grew 8% over last year. The full-price comp increase of 0.4% was impacted by planned anniversary turns from last quarter. To normalize for this, Q2 and Q3 combined full-price comps increased by 2.5% compared to flat comp growth last year. 
We're pleased with the momentum in our off-price business, which delivered a comp sales gain of 5.8% and exceeded our expectations across all merchandise divisions. This reflected our focused efforts throughout the year to accelerate inventory turns and strengthen our merchandise assortment.
Moving to our second key deliverable of improving profitability and returns. Generational investments are continuing to scale. These investments contributed approximately half of our year-to-date net sales increase. We're tracking against our expectations for 2018, which we shared at the beginning of the year. Generational investments are expected to deliver $1.8 billion in sales and achieve our EBIT plan. 
Our strength in product margin is another driver of long-term profitable growth. For the year, we remain on track for product margins to be flat or slightly up. Third quarter gross profit decreased 137 basis points from last year, and this was primarily due to timing, including Q2's revenue recognition impact of $30 million, in addition to off-price mix. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 19 basis points, consistent with our expectations. This reflected flat product margins and occupancy rate, offset by the mix from off-price growth.
Ending inventory increased 7% over last year, primarily due to timing associated with holiday. We pulled forward receipts to set holiday product earlier as part of our strategy. In addition, we had higher inventories in-transit due to the end of the quarter, shifting 1 week closer to holiday relative to last year. Excluding this timing impact, Q3 inventory growth approximated sales growth. We expect to end the year with inventories in line with sales growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our SG&A rate was generally flat to last year. This reflected ongoing progress in bending the curve in expense growth. Our digital capabilities in marketing, technology and supply chain are critical enablers of the customer experience.
Through productivity improvements, we expect moderate expense growth for our digital capabilities to mid-single-digits this year compared with 10% annual growth over the last couple of years. Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our overall SG&A grew 6% year-to-date, on track for mid-single-digit growth for the year. 
Our third key deliverable is maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our long-term philosophy is to have a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $640 million and free cash flow of around $250 million. In August, our board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and we repurchased $70 million in the third quarter.
Turning to our full year expectations. We updated our annual EPS outlook to incorporate third quarter results, raising the low end of our range by $0.05 when excluding the nonrecurring charge. From a top line perspective, we are assuming a continuation of underlying trends with a comp increase of approximately 2% for the year compared with our prior outlook of 1.5% to 2%. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, we expect leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of fewer Rack store openings. We will also lap a onetime employee investment of $16 million associated with last year's tax reform.
To wrap up, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year when excluding the nonrecurring charge. We remain focused on strengthening our product margins, scaling our generational investments and improving our expense efficiencies. We are well positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.

So in general, the way that we are giving guidance for the full year, I think you can kind of back into it, we don't typically give guidance for between full-price and off-price. But I will say this, we set the total JWN comp guidance, it was really then with consistent trends that we see in the business over time.

I think if you look at underlying trends in both businesses, you can kind of back into what Q4's sitting at, and it's pretty much in line with what we've seen for the rest of the year. As far as the margin components to it, as we talked about, we're expecting to get product margin to be flat to slightly up, and we're expecting to get some leverage out of our occupancy expense. And we believe, and kind of back into Q4, but based on our guidance, it would infer that we are at inflection point for the year as far as the EBIT rate."

In terms of holiday receipts, we tried to signal that in the last quarter's call. But as was pointed out in both Anne's and my -- our comments, there was some timing factors, but we also felt it was important to be in a strong position as we got into the holiday season. There's a 1-week change with the holiday this year. But we've seen -- your question was if you've seen any outcomes from it. No question, last month, we saw some reaction to cold weather, so starting with outerwear and boots. So we feel optimistic about this holiday season. We've worked hard to take the friction out for the customer experience. And we want to be a destination for gift-giving, and that requires having the right product and being in-stock and adding that inventory where the demand is for the customer. So our merchandising team has really taken to heart both last year and previous year's holidays results and have made some adjustments to it. We think we're in a good position there. But again, we also tried to convey that inventory management's important. We've managed inventories well throughout the year. We don't want that signal to be mixed because we fully intend to continue to have our inventories in line. 
The last question you had was regarding fulfillment. It's such a key component of our strategy and the ability to take care of the customer. So fulfillment, years ago, was done in bulk and just from a store point of view. And now it's about eaches. It's about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it. And our fulfillment centers outside of our distribution centers are based on the Midwest and the East Coast. We do a lot of business on the West Coast and specifically Southern California. So we were challenged in terms of our delivery times to be able to service those customers. We've made a significant investment for a local omni hub there and 2 facilities to be able to not only take care of fulfillment, the stores, full-price and off-price, but to be able to service the customer that we're aspiring to do through our Nordstrom Local efforts and which we are embarking on in L.A. So a key component of being able to execute Nordstrom Local is improving the supply chain, and we've certainly made a significant investment along those lines. And that hopefully will bear fruit over the next 24 months."

Are we able to have newness to the customer, a curated and balanced buy? And when we get overbought, we get choked up, it puts a real pressure on the margins, and it affects that newness. It's particularly true in off-price, our ability to be in the market and be able to respond more timely to the customer feedback we're getting. And all of 2017, we found ourselves on the other side of that ledger. So this past year, our merchandising team, which we're really proud of, they've worked really hard to get their inventories in line and to work on that balance and flow. And we really think the results are a reflection of those efforts. Also, would point out, we're very unique, and we feel very fortunate to have a very strong digital off-price business. Most of our competition doesn't have that. It's how the customer wants to shop. And just like in full-price, we view it collectively. So that 5.8% was driven in large part through the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, with the Rack side of the business being a little bit flatter if you silo it. But we don't look at that way, and the customer doesn't look at that way. It's very seamless for how the customer wants to buy and return the merchandise between those 2 channels, and we want to continue to get to work on that. And again, that's how the customer wants to shop with us."

For the Q3, again, we have revenue recognition as well as a lot of other timing adjustments associated with it, which is why we are looking at this more of a year-to-date basis. And then you had a higher mix of off-price versus full-price, which had a little bit of a margin impact for the quarter as well. So it's really a lot of it is just timing-related. And that's why we start to give additional color for the year-to-date where we are as well as where we are going to land for the full year so that you can kind of see we're very much in line with our expectations in the guidance we've been giving. As far as full-price for the comp, the reason why we're talking about Q2, Q3 together is because of the impact of the Anniversary Sale shift in the calendar and with the returns coming in, in the third quarter. So when we look at a 2.5% comp, we're actually pretty pleased with where that landed. And as far as the 0.4, it's pretty much in line with our expectations.

Loyalty is marketing, and we've worked hard over the years to have a personalized approach with our customers and to improve that relationship and bond. We've had various programs over the years to enhance the loyalty experience, and The Nordy Club is just another step along those lines. We've only got about 30 days under our belt. But as I indicated in our -- my remarks, we're getting some really positive feedback. We see that through just the adoption in the Nordstrom app. It's up considerably. We now have the ability to get the rewards or points back to the customer quicker. We're able to communicate closer with the customer. We had 4 levels before now. Now we have 5. We're able to, again, in a more personalized way, support our most loyal customers. As I mentioned, it's 56% of our sales, and we've seen a 15% gain. We think The Nordy Club is a step along those lines. In terms of the margin, we don't see a material change, particularly this year, as we're just getting started. So there's some startup costs and then plus the gains with the sales, we think it's going to be relatively neutral from a bottom line point of view. But again, it's the right thing to do on behalf of the customer. It sets us up well for the holidays and particularly for 2019."

So it's -- when you look at it each year, it's really -- it's not -- you can do the math on that. And again, it's pretty small, so it's really about identified cardholders with delinquent accounts that we are being charged the higher interest in error. And it's less than 4% of our cardholders. So I think you just have to understand the materiality of it. Having said that, we certainly do not like having this happen with our customers, and we are very sorry that it took place. As far as the inventory and gross margin, if you go back to my comments from the call, and we really -- we feel like we're in line with our expectations, and we feel like we're going to deliver the gross margin for the full year. We certainly believe inventories will be in line with sales. This is more of a timing. And certainly, in our merch margin, we expect to be flat to slightly up as we finish the year as well.

For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength in our full-price and off-price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. 
Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 e-commerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made up 30% of our business.
Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I'd like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action, including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again. We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realize customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us, and that's a responsibility we take seriously. 
Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.
Looking ahead, we're scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. 
We continued our expansion into Canada with 3 additional Racks: in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our 6 Rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations. We expect further synergies from having a full-price and off-price presence in this market. 
Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our Men's Store. We're building on our initial learnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women's store opening planned in fall 2019. 
Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory, along with our digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We're on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement and improved profitability.
Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers a significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that's available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in Buy Online and Pick Up in Store. This is a great example of how we're leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. 
Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by 4x to 7x for product available same or next day in a given market. To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omnichannel hub next year. These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies, and more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster.
Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs, provide customers with more convenient access to our services. A year ago, we opened our first Nordstrom Local in West Hollywood. Encouraged by our initial results, we recently introduced 2 additional locations: in Brentwood and downtown Los Angeles. 
In addition to service and convenience, providing newness is an integral part of our merchandising efforts. Our strategic brand partnerships enable us to offer compelling products to customers and strengthen our product margin. In the third quarter, our strategic brands made up roughly 45% of our full-priced sales. 
Our partnerships with influencers are an important way we're creating inspiration and a sense of discovery for customers. Following a successful launch last fall, we partnered with Arielle Charnas to introduce a new stand-alone brand, Something Navy. Additionally, we launched a collaboration between Atlantic-Pacific and our private label brand, Halogen. Both product launches outperformed our expectations. 
We're also leveraging the Nordstrom brand to drive increased customer engagement. We know that when customers engage with us across various touch points, both their trips and spend increase. Our robust loyalty program gives us the opportunity to serve customers in a more personalized way. We have more than 11 million loyalty customers contributing 56% of year-to-date sales, an increase of roughly 15% over last year. 
Last month, we launched The Nordy Club, an evolution of our loyalty program that offers enhanced services and experiences and a faster earn rate for credit card members. While it's still early, we're encouraged by the uptick in enrollment trends. We look forward to building on the connections our customers have with our brand through The Nordy Club.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on establishing Nordstrom as the gift-giving destination and making it more convenient to shop. We're well positioned to improve the customer experience and believe our combination of digital capabilities and local market assets, our people, product and place, make us uniquely positioned for success in the market.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional insights into our results."

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge. 
As Blake mentioned, in a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. This occurred as a result of settings implemented in 2010. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We are currently assessing the impact to each individual account and will communicate directly with impacted cardholders. We estimated nonrecurring costs of $72 million or $0.28 in EPS, primarily representing refunds and other fees, which we recorded in SG&A in the third quarter.
Excluding this charge, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year. We're focused on 3 key deliverables to increase shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. 
Starting with our first deliverable, continuing market share gains. Our third quarter reflected consistent underlying sales trends. As you may recall, we know the timing considerations that impact year-over-year comparisons, including the new revenue recognition standard and event shifts, resulting from last year's 53rd-week calendar. We reported third quarter total sales growth of 3%, which included an unfavorable timing impact of roughly 100 basis points from Q2. As a reminder, this primarily represented in-transit sales that were recognized as shipment under the new revenue accounting standard rather than deferred. At the end of the second quarter, there was an elevated impact due to the high volume of online anniversary sales. Given these timing considerations, we're continuing to provide color on comparable sales, which are aligned with the 53rd-week calendar in 2017. 
In full-price, underlying trends were consistent and in line with our expectations. This reflected ongoing strength of strategic brands, which grew 8% over last year. The full-price comp increase of 0.4% was impacted by planned anniversary turns from last quarter. To normalize for this, Q2 and Q3 combined full-price comps increased by 2.5% compared to flat comp growth last year. 
We're pleased with the momentum in our off-price business, which delivered a comp sales gain of 5.8% and exceeded our expectations across all merchandise divisions. This reflected our focused efforts throughout the year to accelerate inventory turns and strengthen our merchandise assortment.
Moving to our second key deliverable of improving profitability and returns. Generational investments are continuing to scale. These investments contributed approximately half of our year-to-date net sales increase. We're tracking against our expectations for 2018, which we shared at the beginning of the year. Generational investments are expected to deliver $1.8 billion in sales and achieve our EBIT plan. 
Our strength in product margin is another driver of long-term profitable growth. For the year, we remain on track for product margins to be flat or slightly up. Third quarter gross profit decreased 137 basis points from last year, and this was primarily due to timing, including Q2's revenue recognition impact of $30 million, in addition to off-price mix. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 19 basis points, consistent with our expectations. This reflected flat product margins and occupancy rate, offset by the mix from off-price growth.
Ending inventory increased 7% over last year, primarily due to timing associated with holiday. We pulled forward receipts to set holiday product earlier as part of our strategy. In addition, we had higher inventories in-transit due to the end of the quarter, shifting 1 week closer to holiday relative to last year. Excluding this timing impact, Q3 inventory growth approximated sales growth. We expect to end the year with inventories in line with sales growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our SG&A rate was generally flat to last year. This reflected ongoing progress in bending the curve in expense growth. Our digital capabilities in marketing, technology and supply chain are critical enablers of the customer experience.
Through productivity improvements, we expect moderate expense growth for our digital capabilities to mid-single-digits this year compared with 10% annual growth over the last couple of years. Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our overall SG&A grew 6% year-to-date, on track for mid-single-digit growth for the year. 
Our third key deliverable is maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our long-term philosophy is to have a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $640 million and free cash flow of around $250 million. In August, our board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and we repurchased $70 million in the third quarter.
Turning to our full year expectations. We updated our annual EPS outlook to incorporate third quarter results, raising the low end of our range by $0.05 when excluding the nonrecurring charge. From a top line perspective, we are assuming a continuation of underlying trends with a comp increase of approximately 2% for the year compared with our prior outlook of 1.5% to 2%. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, we expect leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of fewer Rack store openings. We will also lap a onetime employee investment of $16 million associated with last year's tax reform.
To wrap up, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year when excluding the nonrecurring charge. We remain focused on strengthening our product margins, scaling our generational investments and improving our expense efficiencies. We are well positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So in general, the way that we are giving guidance for the full year, I think you can kind of back into it, we don't typically give guidance for between full-price and off-price. But I will say this, we set the total JWN comp guidance, it was really then with consistent trends that we see in the business over time. So if you -- we gave a comp guidance of 2% for the full year -- approximately 2%. I think if you look at underlying trends in both businesses, you can kind of back into what Q4's sitting at, and it's pretty much in line with what we've seen for the rest of the year. As far as the margin components to it, as we talked about, we're expecting to get product margin to be flat to slightly up, and we're expecting to get some leverage out of our occupancy expense. And we believe, and kind of back into Q4, but based on our guidance, it would infer that we are at inflection point for the year as far as the EBIT rate."

In terms of holiday receipts, we tried to signal that in the last quarter's call. But as was pointed out in both Anne's and my -- our comments, there was some timing factors, but we also felt it was important to be in a strong position as we got into the holiday season. There's a 1-week change with the holiday this year. But we've seen -- your question was if you've seen any outcomes from it. No question, last month, we saw some reaction to cold weather, so starting with outerwear and boots. So we feel optimistic about this holiday season. We've worked hard to take the friction out for the customer experience. And we want to be a destination for gift-giving, and that requires having the right product and being in-stock and adding that inventory where the demand is for the customer. So our merchandising team has really taken to heart both last year and previous year's holidays results and have made some adjustments to it. We think we're in a good position there. But again, we also tried to convey that inventory management's important. We've managed inventories well throughout the year. We don't want that signal to be mixed because we fully intend to continue to have our inventories in line. The last question you had was regarding fulfillment. It's such a key component of our strategy and the ability to take care of the customer. So fulfillment, years ago, was done in bulk and just from a store point of view. And now it's about eaches. It's about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it. And our fulfillment centers outside of our distribution centers are based on the Midwest and the East Coast. We do a lot of business on the West Coast and specifically Southern California. So we were challenged in terms of our delivery times to be able to service those customers. We've made a significant investment for a local omni hub there and 2 facilities to be able to not only take care of fulfillment, the stores, full-price and off-price, but to be able to service the customer that we're aspiring to do through our Nordstrom Local efforts and which we are embarking on in L.A. So a key component of being able to execute Nordstrom Local is improving the supply chain, and we've certainly made a significant investment along those lines. And that hopefully will bear fruit over the next 24 months."

Are we able to have newness to the customer, a curated and balanced buy? And when we get overbought, we get choked up, it puts a real pressure on the margins, and it affects that newness. It's particularly true in off-price, our ability to be in the market and be able to respond more timely to the customer feedback we're getting. And all of 2017, we found ourselves on the other side of that ledger. So this past year, our merchandising team, which we're really proud of, they've worked really hard to get their inventories in line and to work on that balance and flow. And we really think the results are a reflection of those efforts. Also, would point out, we're very unique, and we feel very fortunate to have a very strong digital off-price business. Most of our competition doesn't have that. It's how the customer wants to shop. And just like in full-price, we view it collectively. So that 5.8% was driven in large part through the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, with the Rack side of the business being a little bit flatter if you silo it. But we don't look at that way, and the customer doesn't look at that way. It's very seamless for how the customer wants to buy and return the merchandise between those 2 channels, and we want to continue to get to work on that. And again, that's how the customer wants to shop with us."

For the Q3, again, we have revenue recognition as well as a lot of other timing adjustments associated with it, which is why we are looking at this more of a year-to-date basis. And then you had a higher mix of off-price versus full-price, which had a little bit of a margin impact for the quarter as well. So it's really a lot of it is just timing-related. And that's why we start to give additional color for the year-to-date where we are as well as where we are going to land for the full year so that you can kind of see we're very much in line with our expectations in the guidance we've been giving. As far as full-price for the comp, the reason why we're talking about Q2, Q3 together is because of the impact of the Anniversary Sale shift in the calendar and with the returns coming in, in the third quarter. So when we look at a 2.5% comp, we're actually pretty pleased with where that landed. And as far as the 0.4, it's pretty much in line with our expectations.

So we have that. We also had the disadvantage in our initial opening where we didn't have Racks at first, and that impacted our margin. Now that we have 6 Racks, we're getting closer to parity in the U.S. There is more work to be done. We'll continue to focus on that but there is a slight difference currently between the margin in Canada and the U.S. Your next question was on the Men's Store in Manhattan, and we're just really pleased with the opportunity to be able to have this store and to open it and particularly in advance of the Tower. We're learning a lot. So though we were in Manhattan with the Rack, and though we have really, our most strongest digital business there, we're learning a lot how to service the customer there. And it ranges from the supply chain to the talent there to just the seasonality of the rhythm of the business within the city. It's been a great experience, and we're really pleased with some of the customer feedback we're getting.

We've had various programs over the years to enhance the loyalty experience, and The Nordy Club is just another step along those lines. We've only got about 30 days under our belt. But as I indicated in our -- my remarks, we're getting some really positive feedback. We see that through just the adoption in the Nordstrom app. It's up considerably. We now have the ability to get the rewards or points back to the customer quicker. We're able to communicate closer with the customer. We had 4 levels before now. Now we have 5. We're able to, again, in a more personalized way, support our most loyal customers. As I mentioned, it's 56% of our sales, and we've seen a 15% gain. We think The Nordy Club is a step along those lines. In terms of the margin, we don't see a material change, particularly this year, as we're just getting started. So there's some startup costs and then plus the gains with the sales, we think it's going to be relatively neutral from a bottom line point of view.

And again, it's pretty small, so it's really about identified cardholders with delinquent accounts that we are being charged the higher interest in error. And it's less than 4% of our cardholders.

As far as the inventory and gross margin, if you go back to my comments from the call, and we really -- we feel like we're in line with our expectations, and we feel like we're going to deliver the gross margin for the full year. We certainly believe inventories will be in line with sales. This is more of a timing. And certainly, in our merch margin, we expect to be flat to slightly up as we finish the year as well.

We're focused on our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world through our 3 strategic pillars: one, providing a compelling product offering; two, delivering exceptional services and experiences; and three, leveraging the strength of our Nordstrom brand. 
For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength in our full-price and off-price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. 
Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 e-commerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made up 30% of our business.
Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I'd like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action, including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again. We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realize customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us, and that's a responsibility we take seriously. 
Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.
Looking ahead, we're scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. 
We continued our expansion into Canada with 3 additional Racks: in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our 6 Rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations. We expect further synergies from having a full-price and off-price presence in this market. 
Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our Men's Store. We're building on our initial learnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women's store opening planned in fall 2019. 
Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory, along with our digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We're on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement and improved profitability.
Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers a significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that's available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in Buy Online and Pick Up in Store. This is a great example of how we're leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. 
Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by 4x to 7x for product available same or next day in a given market. To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omnichannel hub next year. These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies, and more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster.
Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs, provide customers with more convenient access to our services. A year ago, we opened our first Nordstrom Local in West Hollywood. Encouraged by our initial results, we recently introduced 2 additional locations: in Brentwood and downtown Los Angeles. 
In addition to service and convenience, providing newness is an integral part of our merchandising efforts. Our strategic brand partnerships enable us to offer compelling products to customers and strengthen our product margin. In the third quarter, our strategic brands made up roughly 45% of our full-priced sales. 
Our partnerships with influencers are an important way we're creating inspiration and a sense of discovery for customers. Following a successful launch last fall, we partnered with Arielle Charnas to introduce a new stand-alone brand, Something Navy. Additionally, we launched a collaboration between Atlantic-Pacific and our private label brand, Halogen. Both product launches outperformed our expectations. 
We're also leveraging the Nordstrom brand to drive increased customer engagement. We know that when customers engage with us across various touch points, both their trips and spend increase. Our robust loyalty program gives us the opportunity to serve customers in a more personalized way. We have more than 11 million loyalty customers contributing 56% of year-to-date sales, an increase of roughly 15% over last year. 
Last month, we launched The Nordy Club, an evolution of our loyalty program that offers enhanced services and experiences and a faster earn rate for credit card members. While it's still early, we're encouraged by the uptick in enrollment trends. We look forward to building on the connections our customers have with our brand through The Nordy Club.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on establishing Nordstrom as the gift-giving destination and making it more convenient to shop. We're well positioned to improve the customer experience and believe our combination of digital capabilities and local market assets, our people, product and place, make us uniquely positioned for success in the market.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional insights into our results."

Before I discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance, I'd like to provide additional color on the nonrecurring charge. 
As Blake mentioned, in a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in error. This occurred as a result of settings implemented in 2010. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit, with most receiving less than $100. We are currently assessing the impact to each individual account and will communicate directly with impacted cardholders. We estimated nonrecurring costs of $72 million or $0.28 in EPS, primarily representing refunds and other fees, which we recorded in SG&A in the third quarter.
Excluding this charge, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year. We're focused on 3 key deliverables to increase shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. 
Starting with our first deliverable, continuing market share gains. Our third quarter reflected consistent underlying sales trends. As you may recall, we know the timing considerations that impact year-over-year comparisons, including the new revenue recognition standard and event shifts, resulting from last year's 53rd-week calendar. We reported third quarter total sales growth of 3%, which included an unfavorable timing impact of roughly 100 basis points from Q2. As a reminder, this primarily represented in-transit sales that were recognized as shipment under the new revenue accounting standard rather than deferred. At the end of the second quarter, there was an elevated impact due to the high volume of online anniversary sales. Given these timing considerations, we're continuing to provide color on comparable sales, which are aligned with the 53rd-week calendar in 2017. 
In full-price, underlying trends were consistent and in line with our expectations. This reflected ongoing strength of strategic brands, which grew 8% over last year. The full-price comp increase of 0.4% was impacted by planned anniversary turns from last quarter. To normalize for this, Q2 and Q3 combined full-price comps increased by 2.5% compared to flat comp growth last year. 
We're pleased with the momentum in our off-price business, which delivered a comp sales gain of 5.8% and exceeded our expectations across all merchandise divisions. This reflected our focused efforts throughout the year to accelerate inventory turns and strengthen our merchandise assortment.
Moving to our second key deliverable of improving profitability and returns. Generational investments are continuing to scale. These investments contributed approximately half of our year-to-date net sales increase. We're tracking against our expectations for 2018, which we shared at the beginning of the year. Generational investments are expected to deliver $1.8 billion in sales and achieve our EBIT plan. 
Our strength in product margin is another driver of long-term profitable growth. For the year, we remain on track for product margins to be flat or slightly up. Third quarter gross profit decreased 137 basis points from last year, and this was primarily due to timing, including Q2's revenue recognition impact of $30 million, in addition to off-price mix. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 19 basis points, consistent with our expectations. This reflected flat product margins and occupancy rate, offset by the mix from off-price growth.
Ending inventory increased 7% over last year, primarily due to timing associated with holiday. We pulled forward receipts to set holiday product earlier as part of our strategy. In addition, we had higher inventories in-transit due to the end of the quarter, shifting 1 week closer to holiday relative to last year. Excluding this timing impact, Q3 inventory growth approximated sales growth. We expect to end the year with inventories in line with sales growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our SG&A rate was generally flat to last year. This reflected ongoing progress in bending the curve in expense growth. Our digital capabilities in marketing, technology and supply chain are critical enablers of the customer experience.
Through productivity improvements, we expect moderate expense growth for our digital capabilities to mid-single-digits this year compared with 10% annual growth over the last couple of years. Excluding the nonrecurring charge, our overall SG&A grew 6% year-to-date, on track for mid-single-digit growth for the year. 
Our third key deliverable is maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our long-term philosophy is to have a consistent and balanced approach between reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $640 million and free cash flow of around $250 million. In August, our board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and we repurchased $70 million in the third quarter.
Turning to our full year expectations. We updated our annual EPS outlook to incorporate third quarter results, raising the low end of our range by $0.05 when excluding the nonrecurring charge. From a top line perspective, we are assuming a continuation of underlying trends with a comp increase of approximately 2% for the year compared with our prior outlook of 1.5% to 2%. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, we expect leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of fewer Rack store openings. We will also lap a onetime employee investment of $16 million associated with last year's tax reform.
To wrap up, we expect to achieve an inflection point for profitable growth this year when excluding the nonrecurring charge. We remain focused on strengthening our product margins, scaling our generational investments and improving our expense efficiencies. We are well positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.

So in general, the way that we are giving guidance for the full year, I think you can kind of back into it, we don't typically give guidance for between full-price and off-price. But I will say this, we set the total JWN comp guidance, it was really then with consistent trends that we see in the business over time. So if you -- we gave a comp guidance of 2% for the full year -- approximately 2%. I think if you look at underlying trends in both businesses, you can kind of back into what Q4's sitting at, and it's pretty much in line with what we've seen for the rest of the year. As far as the margin components to it, as we talked about, we're expecting to get product margin to be flat to slightly up, and we're expecting to get some leverage out of our occupancy expense. And we believe, and kind of back into Q4, but based on our guidance, it would infer that we are at inflection point for the year as far as the EBIT rate."

In terms of holiday receipts, we tried to signal that in the last quarter's call. But as was pointed out in both Anne's and my -- our comments, there was some timing factors, but we also felt it was important to be in a strong position as we got into the holiday season. There's a 1-week change with the holiday this year. But we've seen -- your question was if you've seen any outcomes from it. No question, last month, we saw some reaction to cold weather, so starting with outerwear and boots. So we feel optimistic about this holiday season. We've worked hard to take the friction out for the customer experience. And we want to be a destination for gift-giving, and that requires having the right product and being in-stock and adding that inventory where the demand is for the customer. So our merchandising team has really taken to heart both last year and previous year's holidays results and have made some adjustments to it. We think we're in a good position there. But again, we also tried to convey that inventory management's important. We've managed inventories well throughout the year. We don't want that signal to be mixed because we fully intend to continue to have our inventories in line. The last question you had was regarding fulfillment. It's such a key component of our strategy and the ability to take care of the customer. So fulfillment, years ago, was done in bulk and just from a store point of view. And now it's about eaches. It's about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it. And our fulfillment centers outside of our distribution centers are based on the Midwest and the East Coast. We do a lot of business on the West Coast and specifically Southern California. So we were challenged in terms of our delivery times to be able to service those customers. We've made a significant investment for a local omni hub there and 2 facilities to be able to not only take care of fulfillment, the stores, full-price and off-price, but to be able to service the customer that we're aspiring to do through our Nordstrom Local efforts and which we are embarking on in L.A. So a key component of being able to execute Nordstrom Local is improving the supply chain, and we've certainly made a significant investment along those lines. And that hopefully will bear fruit over the next 24 months."

Are we able to have newness to the customer, a curated and balanced buy? And when we get overbought, we get choked up, it puts a real pressure on the margins, and it affects that newness. It's particularly true in off-price, our ability to be in the market and be able to respond more timely to the customer feedback we're getting. And all of 2017, we found ourselves on the other side of that ledger. So this past year, our merchandising team, which we're really proud of, they've worked really hard to get their inventories in line and to work on that balance and flow. And we really think the results are a reflection of those efforts. Also, would point out, we're very unique, and we feel very fortunate to have a very strong digital off-price business. Most of our competition doesn't have that. It's how the customer wants to shop. And just like in full-price, we view it collectively. So that 5.8% was driven in large part through the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, with the Rack side of the business being a little bit flatter if you silo it. But we don't look at that way, and the customer doesn't look at that way. It's very seamless for how the customer wants to buy and return the merchandise between those 2 channels, and we want to continue to get to work on that. And again, that's how the customer wants to shop with us."

For the Q3, again, we have revenue recognition as well as a lot of other timing adjustments associated with it, which is why we are looking at this more of a year-to-date basis. And then you had a higher mix of off-price versus full-price, which had a little bit of a margin impact for the quarter as well. So it's really a lot of it is just timing-related. And that's why we start to give additional color for the year-to-date where we are as well as where we are going to land for the full year so that you can kind of see we're very much in line with our expectations in the guidance we've been giving. As far as full-price for the comp, the reason why we're talking about Q2, Q3 together is because of the impact of the Anniversary Sale shift in the calendar and with the returns coming in, in the third quarter. So when we look at a 2.5% comp, we're actually pretty pleased with where that landed. And as far as the 0.4, it's pretty much in line with our expectations.

So we have that. We also had the disadvantage in our initial opening where we didn't have Racks at first, and that impacted our margin. Now that we have 6 Racks, we're getting closer to parity in the U.S. There is more work to be done. We'll continue to focus on that but there is a slight difference currently between the margin in Canada and the U.S. Your next question was on the Men's Store in Manhattan, and we're just really pleased with the opportunity to be able to have this store and to open it and particularly in advance of the Tower. We're learning a lot. So though we were in Manhattan with the Rack, and though we have really, our most strongest digital business there, we're learning a lot how to service the customer there. And it ranges from the supply chain to the talent there to just the seasonality of the rhythm of the business within the city. It's been a great experience, and we're really pleased with some of the customer feedback we're getting.

We've had various programs over the years to enhance the loyalty experience, and The Nordy Club is just another step along those lines. We've only got about 30 days under our belt. But as I indicated in our -- my remarks, we're getting some really positive feedback. We see that through just the adoption in the Nordstrom app. It's up considerably. We now have the ability to get the rewards or points back to the customer quicker. We're able to communicate closer with the customer. We had 4 levels before now. Now we have 5. We're able to, again, in a more personalized way, support our most loyal customers. As I mentioned, it's 56% of our sales, and we've seen a 15% gain. We think The Nordy Club is a step along those lines. In terms of the margin, we don't see a material change, particularly this year, as we're just getting started. So there's some startup costs and then plus the gains with the sales, we think it's going to be relatively neutral from a bottom line point of view.
