I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full-year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
[indiscernible] VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, reporting $1,165,000,000 in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 
2017 was a strong year for the .com and  net domain name base in which the company process 36.7 million registrations and finished the year with 146.4 million names. 
During the year, we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 
Also last year, we renewed the ..net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million shares for $145 million. During the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. 
Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name basein .com and .net totaled 146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. 
During the fourth quarter, we processed 9 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter, we continued to see strength from domestic registrars, which was offset by a lower second time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surging names from late 2015. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2% and 3%. 
For the first quarter, we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. 
I'd like to comment now in the recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8K we filed in January. In it, we disclose that the U.S. Department of Justice as Trust Division notified us that it has disclosed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We are now engaged in process to move the delegation of .web forward. However, as this a process, we cannot say when it will conclude. Whilst possible that our operation of .web will commence this year, the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we'll provide you with updates as appropriate. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1.165 billion, up 2% from fiscal 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016",967,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1.165 billion, up 2% from fiscal 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers abroad. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. 
As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I then will discuss our 2018 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on 125.5 million and 124.1 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million, and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on implications to the accompany of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I will refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million, consisting of one-time U.S. taxes on a cumulative foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. 
As a result of the one-time U.S. Tax Act -- U.S. taxes on a cumulative foreign earnings, we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes and based on current exchange rates. 
Additionally, on a go forward basis, due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. 
Also, lower corporate tax rates and limitations under deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we are presently evaluating our capital structure, including a possible redemption of our convertible debentures. 
Finally, since mid-2017, we have used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. 
With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And sometimes those programs we have to pivot during the year, and we had lighter marketing expenses as we talked about in the middle of 2017 and we finally got some programs coming out. We did make a little bit of a shift away from some registrar marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We do, do some of our advertising for our brands, both .com and .net, both domestically and abroad, and so we've been living a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here."

As mentioned, this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. And while I don't think it makes sense to go through all the puts and takes of the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax in foreign earnings and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate. But that amount does include impacts as well from our repatriation. As far as interest limitations, yes, tax reform clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense. There are some limitations there. And as a result, as I've mentioned, we are looking at our entire capital structure. We're looking at it. We'll be evaluating at.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full-year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
[indiscernible] VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, reporting $1,165,000,000 in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 
2017 was a strong year for the .com and  net domain name base in which the company process 36.7 million registrations and finished the year with 146.4 million names. 
During the year, we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 
Also last year, we renewed the ..net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million shares for $145 million. During the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. 
Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. 
During the fourth quarter, we processed 9 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter, we continued to see strength from domestic registrars, which was offset by a lower second time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surging names from late 2015. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2% and 3%. 
For the first quarter, we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. 
I'd like to comment now in the recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8K we filed in January. In it, we disclose that the U.S. Department of Justice as Trust Division notified us that it has disclosed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We are now engaged in process to move the delegation of .web forward. However, as this a process, we cannot say when it will conclude. Whilst possible that our operation of .web will commence this year, the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we'll provide you with updates as appropriate. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1.165 billion, up 2% from fiscal 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016",967,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1.165 billion, up 2% from fiscal 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers abroad. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. 
As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I then will discuss our 2018 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on 125.5 million and 124.1 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million, and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on implications to the accompany of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I will refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million, consisting of one-time U.S. taxes on a cumulative foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. 
As a result of the one-time U.S. Tax Act -- U.S. taxes on a cumulative foreign earnings, we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes and based on current exchange rates. 
Additionally, on a go forward basis, due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. 
Also, lower corporate tax rates and limitations under deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we are presently evaluating our capital structure, including a possible redemption of our convertible debentures. 
Finally, since mid-2017, we have used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. 
With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We do, do some of our advertising for our brands, both .com and .net, both domestically and abroad, and so we've been living a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that.

So as mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a GAAP perspective, we made an accrual for the one-time transition tax, and that was partially offset by the reevaluation of our details. From a GAAP perspective, that was about $9 million. From a cash tax perspective, as you mentioned, we're guiding to $70 million to $90 million in 2018, and that's up from about $28 million this year. As mentioned, this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. And while I don't think it makes sense to go through all the puts and takes of the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax in foreign earnings and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate. But that amount does include impacts as well from our repatriation. As far as interest limitations, yes, tax reform clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense. There are some limitations there. And as a result, as I've mentioned, we are looking at our entire capital structure. We're looking at it. We'll be evaluating at. And as convert to part of that capital structure, we look at them as well."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
[indiscernible], VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, reporting $1,165,000,000 in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 
2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the year with 146.4 million names. During the year, we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million shares for $145 million. During the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.  
Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter, we continued to see strength from domestic registrars, which was offset by a lower second-time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter, we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. 
I'd like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8-K we filed in January. In it, we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division notified us that it had disclosed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We are now engaged in ICANN's process to move the delegation of .web forward. However, as this is ICANN's process, we cannot say when it will conclude. And while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year, the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we'll provide you with updates as appropriate. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 201",958,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers abroad. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. 
As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I then will discuss our 2018 full-year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on 125.5 million and 124.1 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I will refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million, consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. 
As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings, we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of foreign withholding taxes and based on current exchange rates. Additionally, on a go-forward basis, due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. 
Also the lower corporate tax rates and limitations under deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we are presently evaluating our capital structure, including a possible redemption of our convertible debentures. 
Finally, since mid-2017, we have used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. 
With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We did do some of our advertising for our brands, both .com and .net, both domestically and abroad. And so we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that.

As mentioned, this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. And while I don't think it makes sense to go through all the puts and takes of the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings, and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate. But that amount does include impacts as well from our repatriation. As far as interest limitations, yes, tax reform clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense. There are some limitations there. And as a result, as I've mentioned, we are looking at our entire capital structure. We're looking at it. We'll be evaluating it.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Team VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, reporting $1,165,000,000 in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 
2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the year with 146.4 million names. During the year, we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million shares for $145 million. During the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.  
Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter, we continued to see strength from domestic registrars, which was offset by a lower second-time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter, we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. 
I'd like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8-K we filed in January. In it, we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division notified us that it had disclosed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We are now engaged in ICANN's process to move the delegation of .web forward. However, as this is ICANN's process, we cannot say when it will conclude. And while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year, the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we'll provide you with updates as appropriate. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 201",960,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers abroad. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. 
As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I then will discuss our 2018 full-year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on 125.5 million and 124.1 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I will refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million, consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. 
As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings, we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of foreign withholding taxes and based on current exchange rates. Additionally, on a go-forward basis, due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. 
Also the lower corporate tax rates and limitations on the deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we are presently evaluating our capital structure, including a possible redemption of our convertible debentures. 
Finally, since mid-2017, we have used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. 
With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And we had lighter marketing expenses, as we talked about, in the middle of 2017. And we finally got some programs coming out. We did make a little bit of a shift away from some registrar marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did do some of our advertising for our brands, both .com and .net, both domestically and abroad. And so we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here."

As mentioned, this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. And while I don't think it makes sense to go through all the puts and takes of the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings, and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate. But that amount does include impacts as well from our repatriation. As far as interest limitations, yes, tax reform clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense. There are some limitations there. And as a result, as I've mentioned, we are looking at our entire capital structure. We're looking at it. We'll be evaluating it.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which kept a strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Team VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, reporting $1,165,000,000 in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 
2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the year with 146.4 million names. During the year, we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million shares for $145 million. During the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.  
Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter, we continued to see strength from domestic registrars, which was offset by a lower second-time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter, we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. 
I'd like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8-K we filed in January. In it, we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division notified us that it had disclosed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We are now engaged in ICANN's process to move the delegation of .web forward. However, as this is ICANN's process, we cannot say when it will conclude. And while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year, the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we'll provide you with updates as appropriate. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 201",960,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1,165,000,000, up 2% from fiscal 2016, and delivered GAAP operating income of $708 million, up 3% from $687 million for the full year 2016. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers abroad. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. 
As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I then will discuss our 2018 full-year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on 125.5 million and 124.1 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I will refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million, consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. 
As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings, we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of foreign withholding taxes and based on current exchange rates. Additionally, on a go-forward basis, due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. 
Also the lower corporate tax rates and limitations on the deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we are presently evaluating our capital structure, including a possible redemption of our convertible debentures. 
Finally, since mid-2017, we have used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. 
With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I mean, keep in mind though on an annual basis, our total marketing expense is pretty flat year-over-year. As I talked about a few quarters ago, we clearly look to execute on marketing programs that we think drive the best return for the company. And sometimes those programs have to pivot during the year. And we had lighter marketing expenses, as we talked about, in the middle of 2017. And we finally got some programs coming out. We did make a little bit of a shift away from some registrar marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did do some of our advertising for our brands, both .com and .net, both domestically and abroad. And so we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here."

And that was partially offset by the reevaluation of our DTLs. So from a GAAP perspective, that was about $9 million. From a cash tax perspective, as you mentioned, we're guiding to $70 million to $90 million in 2018. And that's up from about $28 million this year. As mentioned, this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act, including the impacts of our intended repatriation. And while I don't think it makes sense to go through all the puts and takes of the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings, and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate. But that amount does include impacts as well from our repatriation. As far as interest limitations, yes, tax reform clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense. There are some limitations there. And as a result, as I've mentioned, we are looking at our entire capital structure. We're looking at it. We'll be evaluating it. And as our converts are part of that capital structure, we look at them as well."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $299 million come up at 3.7% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later.
Also, we've paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our impending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter.
Our financial position remains strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net. During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2.5% and 3.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2018 of between 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations. 
I also want to report that we are engaging in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the Cooperative Agreement, which is ongoing but beyond that, we don't have more to say at this time.

As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year.
As of March at 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures, and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter, and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares. This compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter.
As noted in our last call, as a result of the tax act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million, and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million, respectively for the first quarter last year.
First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation. 
As mentioned last quarter, in light of the Tax Act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week, on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert the debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock. The actual number of shares issued for holders will elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ramped from March 15, 2018 through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders hold like to convert. For comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully-diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for this settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter.
Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure with U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure, and with the diminished tax benefits post tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures.
Now I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance.  Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,200,000,000 to [ $1,215,000,000 ] narrowed from the $1,195,000,000 to [ $1,215,000,000 ]  provided in our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, a decrease from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes. 
The capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, changed from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And while 2017 was to steal up year-over-year, when asked you exclude those impacts from 2017, it is still really consistent with our normal expectations of a slightly rising renewal rate associated with an aging domain name base.

But I think that's a sort of a tactical question, that our ongoing analysis would yield.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later.
Also, we've paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our pending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter.
Our financial position remains strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million, consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net. During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2.5% and 3.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2018 of between 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations. 
I also want to report that we are engaged in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the Cooperative Agreement, which is ongoing. But beyond that, we don't have more to say at this time.

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.A",823,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.
As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year.
As of March at 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics. First quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares. This compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter.
As noted in our last call, as a result of the tax act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million, and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation. 
As mentioned last quarter, in light of the tax act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert their debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock. 
The actual number of shares issued for holders who elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ran from March 15, 2018, through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders elect like to convert. For comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for this settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter.
Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure. With U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure. And with the diminished tax benefits post tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures.
Now I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, decreased from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, changed from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And if something there changes, we would certainly share it when appropriate. But fundamentally, nothing has really changed.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later.
Also, we paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our pending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter.
Our financial position remains strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million, consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net. During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2.5% and 3.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2018 of between 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations. 
I also want to report that we are engaged in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the Cooperative Agreement, which is ongoing. But beyond that, we don't have more to say at this time.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.A",822,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.
As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year.
As of March at 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics. First quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares. This compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter.
As noted in our last call, as a result of the tax act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million, and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation. 
As mentioned last quarter, in light of the tax act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert their debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock. 
The actual number of shares issued for holders who elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ran from March 15, 2018, through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders elect to convert. For comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for the settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter.
Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure. With U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure. And with the diminished tax benefits post tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures.
Now I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, decreased from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, changed from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And while 2017 was still up year-over-year, when I exclude those impacts from 2017, it is still really consistent with our normal expectations of a slightly rising renewal rate associated with an aging domain name base.

The philosophy that drives that hasn't changed a bit. I think you're asking a more tactical question as to whether or not some rethinking would lead to some analysis that says a dividend of some shift in, or a difference or reallocation of buybacks to dividends. And we don't guide to that, as George said, but I think that's a sort of a tactical question that our ongoing analysis would yield. And if something there changes, we would certainly share it when appropriate. But fundamentally, nothing has really changed. We're just looking at a very dynamic situation where the tax law gives us opportunities.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later.
Also, we paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our pending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter.
Our financial position remains strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million, consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net. During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2.5% and 3.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2018 of between 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations. 
I also want to report that we are engaged in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the Cooperative Agreement, which is ongoing. But beyond that, we don't have more to say at this time.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially.

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.
As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year.
As of March at 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics. First quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares. This compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter.
As noted in our last call, as a result of the tax act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million, and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation. 
As mentioned last quarter, in light of the tax act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert their debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock. 
The actual number of shares issued for holders who elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ran from March 15, 2018, through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders elect to convert. For comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for the settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter.
Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure. With U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure. And with the diminished tax benefits post tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures.
Now I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,195,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, decreased from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, changed from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And while 2017 was still up year-over-year, when I exclude those impacts from 2017, it is still really consistent with our normal expectations of a slightly rising renewal rate associated with an aging domain name base. So I don't think there's anything unusual to call out there other than the base continues to age, and as a result, renewal rates tend to tick up a slight amount as the previous renewed names become a large proportion of the overall base."

The philosophy that drives that hasn't changed a bit. I think you're asking a more tactical question as to whether or not some rethinking would lead to some analysis that says a dividend of some shift in, or a difference or reallocation of buybacks to dividends. And we don't guide to that, as George said, but I think that's a sort of a tactical question that our ongoing analysis would yield. And if something there changes, we would certainly share it when appropriate. But fundamentally, nothing has really changed.

This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our second quarter 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.
Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.
The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 12% year-over-year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares for $125 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 149.7 million, consisting of 135.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the second quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.4 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, and we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.0% achieved in the second quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the third quarter of 2018 of between 1.3 million and 1.8 million net registrations.
To update you on our discussions about the Cooperative Agreement, VeriSign and NTIA are engaged in dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like. But beyond that, we do not have anything else to say at this time.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily a result of improved new domain name registrations and improving renewal rates over the prior year.
Operating income for the period totaled $193 million compared with $175 million in the second quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $128 million compared to $123 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.99 for the same quarter of last year.
As of June 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $569 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2% compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares. This compares to $1.07 last quarter and $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $202 million, and free cash flow was $191 million compared with $181 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year.
Now, we would like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 66% and 67%, increased from the 65.5% to 66.5% range provided on the last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $82 million and $89 million, decreased from the $85 million and $92 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, narrowed from the $75 million to $95 million range provided on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2% compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares. This compares to $1.07 last quarter and $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $202 million, and free cash flow was $191 million compared with $181 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
Now we would like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided in our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 66% and 67%, increased from the 65.5% to 66.5% range provided on the last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $82 million and $89 million, decreased from the $85 million and $92 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, narrowed from the $75 million to $95 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 12% year-over-year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares for $125 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled [ 149.7 million ], consisting of 135.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the second quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.4 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, and we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%, this preliminary rate compares to 74.0% achieved in the second quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4.25% with an increase to the domain name base for the third quarter of 2018 of between 1.3 million and 1.8 million net registrations.
To update you on our discussions about the Cooperative Agreement, VeriSign and NTIA are engaged in dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like. But beyond that, we do not have anything else to say at this time.

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily a result of improved new domain name registrations and improving renewal rates over the prior year.
Operating income for the period totaled $193 million compared with $175 million in the second quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $128 million compared to $123 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.99 for the same quarter of last year.
As of June 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $569 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2% compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares. This compares to $1.07 last quarter and $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $202 million, and free cash flow was $191 million compared with $181 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year.
Now, we would like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 66% and 67%, increased from the 65.5% to 66.5% range provided on the last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $82 million and $89 million, decreased from the $85 million and $92 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, narrowed from the $75 million to $95 million range provided on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter.

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 12% year-over-year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares for $125 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 149.7 million, consisting of 135.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the second quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.4 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, and we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.0% achieved in the second quarter of 2017.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4.25% with an increase to the domain name base for the third quarter of 2018 of between 1.3 million and 1.8 million net registrations.
To update you on our discussions about the Cooperative Agreement, VeriSign and NTIA are engaged in dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like. But beyond that, we do not have anything else to say at this time.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily a result of improved new domain name registrations and improving renewal rates over the prior year.
Operating income for the period totaled $193 million compared with $175 million in the second quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $128 million compared to $123 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.99 for the same quarter of last year.
As of June 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $569 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2% compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares. This compares to $1.07 last quarter and $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $202 million, and free cash flow was $191 million compared with $181 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year.
Now we would like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000, narrowed from the $1,200,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 66% and 67%, increased from the 65.5% to 66.5% range provided on the last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $82 million and $89 million, decreased from the $85 million and $92 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, narrowed from the $75 million to $95 million range provided on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year. 
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled $151.7 million, consisting of $137.6 million names for.com and $14.1 million names for .net. 
During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.  Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year ago quarter. 
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions. 
Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability, while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics. 
The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into any agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDOS protection, managed DNS, DNS Firewall and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. 
As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a transition services agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval. 
We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including routes on management, operation of 2 of the 13 Global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the.com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning about Security Services customers to NeuStar. 
To update you on our discussions about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming exploration and are progressing with the NTIA is to amend the cooperation agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an M&A agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time. 
And now, I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. 
Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,211,000,000 to $1,216,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,205,000,000 and $1,215,000,000 provided on our last call. 
Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call. 
Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. 
Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

However, as you point out, we did see some movement between the categories sequentially. We did have a sliding decrease in sales and marketing, which is offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now specifically, the sales and marketing, sequentially, we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activity in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities in late 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 151.7 million, consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net.
During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.  Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year ago quarter.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.
Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability, while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.
The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.
As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a transition services agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.
We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.
To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperation Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time.
And now, I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially.
Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,211,000,000 to $1,216,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 range provided on our last call.
Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call.
Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories sequentially. We did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing, which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now specifically, the sales and marketing, sequentially, we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change. Just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace."

As you point out, our gross adds totaled 9.5 million in the quarter, they were up from 8.9 million a year ago. And this is really the same trend that we've witnessed and reported on pretty much all year. We've had continued gross adds performance from both North American and China registrars. They seem to be performing better this year than they did previously and that's been the trend that we've seen in previous quarters and it's continued here into the third quarter. So again, I think, it's the strong brand in both those markets and will continue to execute on marketing activities to accentuate that brand message into the marketplace."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of September, the domain name [ base in .com and .net ] totaled 151.7 million, consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net.
During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.  Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year ago quarter.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.
Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability, while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.
The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.
As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a transition services agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.
We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.
To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperation Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time.
And now, I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially.
Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,211,000,000 to $1,216,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 range provided on our last call.
Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call.
Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories sequentially. We did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing, which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now specifically, the sales and marketing, sequentially, we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change. Just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of September, the domain name [ base in .com and .net ] totaled 151.7 million, consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net.
During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year ago quarter.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.
Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability, while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.
The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.
As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a transition services agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.
We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.
To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperation Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time.
And now I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially.
Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,211,000,000 to $1,216,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 range provided on our last call.
Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call.
Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories sequentially. We did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing, which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now specifically, the sales and marketing, sequentially, we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change. Just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of September, the domain name [ base in .com and .net ] totaled 151.7 million, consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net.
During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.  Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year ago quarter.
We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.
Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability, while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.
The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.
As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a transition services agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.
We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.
To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperation Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time.
And now I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially.
Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,211,000,000 to $1,216,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,205,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 range provided on our last call.
Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call.
Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories sequentially. We did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing, which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now specifically, the sales and marketing, sequentially, we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change. Just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace."
