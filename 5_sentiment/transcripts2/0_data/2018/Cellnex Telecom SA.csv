Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start this presentation highlighting the main milestones of the year, a year that has been market by a strong execution and market recognition.
First of all, I have to say that we are continuing to deliver on organic performance, reaching the upper part of our guidance for 2017. If you remember, our guidance was from 3% to 4%, and we reached 4% -- we have reached 4%.
We are continuing generating strong leverage free cash flow, growing solid 10% in the year. Third, we are managing a sustainable business model that today offer EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. So as a result of young and long-term contracts that improved our business file.
We are executing on our equity story, by growing in new and existing markets and reinforcing our industrial partnership with key players. As you know, we are consolidating our market positioning in Spain and the Netherlands. We are executing several transactions in France, and in all the countries where we are today.
The fourth part is related with the structural flexibility on our approach to fund financing growth, with around EUR 2 billion of available liquidity and a very efficient capital structure. As you can see, we are talking about maturities beyond 6 years and an average cost a bit below 2%. 
And finally, we believe that the quality of this execution has been recognized by the market, with a share price that has increased 56% in year 2017.
On Slide #5, you can see a very strong performance on our key value metrics, with our adjusted EBITDA growing annually around 25% and our recurring leverage free cash flow per share growing annually at the similar rate over the last 2, 3 years.
If we move to Slide #6, we are showing you a summary of the principal of the 8 deals we have executed in 2017. All in all, we have added 8,000 sites to our footprint on a pro forma basis, and we have committed a total enterprise value of around EUR 2 billion, and we have multiplied our portfolio size since our IPO by 4x.
It's very important to highlight that the European sector is accelerating on our view. The Cellnex project trying to reach European platform. So we are envisaging as well '18 -- 2018 with a very positive perspective.
On Slide #7, we can see the results of our growth strategy, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure rather than almost 80% when -- in 2014.
Around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA is generated outside Spain in a pro forma basis. So all in all, we are transforming single country companies and single or mainly a broadcasting company in a telecom outsourcing infrastructure company, and really an international and European company.
You can see in the left side of the slide, the spread of our footprint across the countries where we are delivering today our services.
And well, I'll pass the floor over to José Manuel to move to the business performance."

Moving to Slide 9. Total PoPs have increased 22% in the period, including the contribution of both organic and change of perimeter in the year.
If we now focus of our organic only, PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance between 3% and 4%. 
Finally, DAS, or DAS nodes, have increased 26% in the year, and we are optimistic that this new business area will become a significant contributor to Cellnex' revenues in the future. Please note, that this is the beginning of 5G.
Moving to Slide 10. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic peak PoPs year-on-year basis, reaching a customer ratio of 1.55. It's change of perimeter is also considered, usually contributing with a lower ratio.
Additionally, we are implementing cellular commercial initiatives to secure future organic growth. We are strengthening our partnership with key customers. We are working under existing framework agreements to secure new tenants. We are implementing new small cell projects and exploring opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. Finally, Cellnex has been certified as 0 outtake supplier by Deutsche Telekom.
Let me now please explain on Slide 11 our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been a strong circa 80%, with a significant margin expansion of 400 basis points in our EBITDA margin.
Moving to revenues. The contribution from our telecom services and broadcasting increased, with a very well-managed cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 22%.
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is slightly positive. Interest rate reflect our capital structure as of end of the year, and taxes reflect our management measures in place. All in all, we are providing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to 2016.
[Audio Gap]
In terms our first convertible bond in January and the very high level of contracted revenues, with a pot lock of EUR 16 billion, or in other words, 20 years of revenues of 7x our net debt.
Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash, and proceeds have been used in the execution of our growth strategy.
[indiscernible] leverage as of December 2017 reached 5.5x on a net debt EBITDA basis, which includes the full year contribution from the new transactions in both debt and adjusted EBITDA.
Moving toward capital structure, on Slide 13. You can see our current debt maturity profile. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing before 2022, and we do have a strong protection against interest rate increases as a result of our fixed rate debt and also our inflation indexation of our revenues.
In summary, in relation to our capital structure, I would like to emphasize the following points. Our strong available liquidity position of EUR 2 billion but [indiscernible] EUR 16 billion no require short-term refinancing, loan maturities, highly attractive terms, a compelling business risk profile and no financing restrictions.
And this leaves us access to several alternatives to fund growth, cash from ongoing operations, the structure is [indiscernible] access to a wide array of debt instruments, financing a project level and also potential equity finance at the OpCo level.
On Slide 14, we are presenting to you the main characteristics of our first convertible bond we issued in January. For us, the issuance has been a landmark transaction, allowing us to diversify our fund resources, extend our maturities and reduce our average cost of debt, with the highest conversion premium in Europe.
And finally, just a few words on financial outlook on Slide 15. We have beaten our 2017 guidance by delivering on all the different contribution lines. 
On the right-hand side, you can also find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the year. You can see the positive impact of the new TV channels being reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies, as well as, of course, the change of perimeter. These, altogether, explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 22%. 
Moving to our 2018 financial outlook. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 405 million and EUR 415 million. We believe we can provide the recurring level free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2017. Our CapEx guidance remains unchanged, and dividends will increase by 10% as per our current dividend policy.
And with this, we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. And please note that, in the following slides, you will also find the frequently asked questions that all of you, you raised to the company. And also in our website are very thorough Excel sheet. And on top of that, of course, the annual accounts with every single detail. Thank you very much."

You were allowed to, by statutory or by board approval, to issue convertible EUR 750 million. You issued EUR 600 million, does that imply that without having additional board improvement, you can issue the remaining EUR 150 million?

According to the Spanish law, the maximum delegation is EUR 750 million. This is, in fact, the delegation that the Board of Directors of Cellnex has. As you suggest, once we have issued 600 million, our current delegation for convertible bonds accounts for EUR 150 million. So yes, you are right with your math. Regarding the debt and the capacity to go into more debt. So we have access to these questions every single quarter. And it's a good question. But I think that it has to be framed in the right context. And I do think that when we talk about net debt to be that, when we talk about leverage, we have to frame this within the business risk profile of the company. The business risk profile of Cellnex seems -- since the last 3 years has changed dramatically, has improved significantly. And this has allowed us to maintain or to improve our net debt to EBITDA, to increase our net debt EBITDA and at the same time, maintaining a very similar or the same quality. We have prepared some slides, 21, 22, 23 and 24, to answer the question. If I go to the key points, I will say to you when accessing debt leverage of Cellnex, please note that we do have EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. And this means 7x our net debt. This is the first concept, I will say, second. Please note that our business risk profile is very strong. It's not excellent yet, but it's very strong. And you know that as the more strong business risk profile is, the better or is the higher net that can be. So our management, all the team is focused on improving the business risk profile. And finally, in Slide 23, you will find our capacity to delever the company every single year. You can see that these accounts for 0.6x and that the EBITDA of the leverage every year. So all of these is careful when estimating the potential power of Cellnex. I think that this slide answer to you."

We caught up in 2016, so we manage to adopt all of the sites plan for the year, plus those we couldn't in 2015. And in 2017, we are coming back to a normalized level. So hence, I would say that this decline in the specific service is offsetting -- is offset by organic growth. So you'd that's why you don't really see the increase in revenues.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start this presentation highlighting the main milestones of the year, a year that has been marked by a strong execution and market recognition.
First of all, I have to say that we are continuing to deliver on organic performance, reaching the upper part of our guidance for 2017. If you remember, our guidance was from 3% to 4%, and we reached 4% -- we have reached 4%.
We are continuing generating a strong leverage free cash flow, growing solid 10% in the year. Third, we are managing a sustainable business model that today offer EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. So as a result of [ young ] and long-term contracts that improved our business file.
We are executing on our equity story by growing in new and in existing markets and reinforcing our industrial partnership with key players. As you know, we are consolidating our market positioning in Spain and The Netherlands. We are executing several transactions in France, in all the countries where we are today.
The fourth part is related with the structural flexibility on our approach to fund financing growth, with around EUR 2 billion of available liquidity and a very efficient capital structure. As you can see, we are talking about maturities beyond 6 years and an average cost a bit below 2%.
And finally, we believe that the quality of this execution has been recognized by the market, with a share price that has increased 56% in year 2017.
On Slide #5, you can see a very strong performance on our key value metrics, with our adjusted EBITDA growing annually around 25% and our recurring leverage free cash flow per share growing annually at the similar rate over the last 2, 3 years.
If we move to Slide #6, we are showing you a summary of the principal of the 8 deals we have executed in 2017. All in all, we have added 8,000 sites to our footprint on a pro forma basis, and we have committed a total enterprise value of around EUR 2 billion, and we have multiplied our portfolio size since our IPO by 4x.
It's very important to highlight that the European sector is accelerating on our view. The Cellnex project trying to reach a European platform. So we are envisaging as well '18 -- 2018 with a very positive perspective.
On Slide #7, we can see the results of our growth strategy, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure rather than almost 80% when -- in 2014.
Around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA is generated outside of Spain in a pro forma basis. So all in all, we are transforming a single-country company in a single or mainly a broadcasting company in a telecom outsourcing infrastructure company, and really an international and a European company.
You can see in the left side of this slide the spread of our footprint across the countries where we are delivering today our services.
And well, I pass the floor to José Manuel to move to the business performance."

Moving to Slide 9. Total PoPs have increased 22% in the period, including the contribution of both organic and change of perimeter in the year.
If we now focus on organic growth only, PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance between 3% and 4%.
Finally, DAS or DAS nodes, have increased 26% in the year, and we are optimistic that this new business area will become a significant contributor to Cellnex' revenues in the future. Please note, that this is the beginning of 5G.
Moving to Slide 10. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic PoPs year-on-year basis, reaching a customer ratio of 1.55. A change of perimeter is also considered, usually contributing with a lower ratio.
Additionally, we are implementing several commercial initiatives to secure future organic growth. We're strengthening our partnership with key customers. We are working under existing framework agreements to secure new tenants. We are implementing new small cell projects and exploring opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. Finally, Cellnex has been certified as Zero Outage Supplier by Deutsche Telekom.
Let me now please explain on Slide 11 our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been a strong circa 80%, with a significant margin expansion of 400 basis points in our EBITDA margin.
Moving to revenues. The contribution from telecom services and broadcasting increased, with a very well-managed cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 22%.
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is slightly positive. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of end of the year, and taxes reflect our management measures in place. All in all, we are providing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to 2016.
[Audio Gap] 
In terms our first convertible bond in January and the very high level of contracted revenues, with a backlog of EUR 16 billion, or in other words, 20 years of revenues or 7x our net debt.
Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash, and proceeds have been used in the execution of our growth strategy.
Cellnex leverage as of December 2017 reached 5.5x on a net debt EBITDA basis, which includes the full year contribution from the new transactions in both debt and adjusted EBITDA.
Moving toward capital structure on Slide 13. You can see our current debt maturity profile. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing before 2022, and we do have a strong protection against interest rate increases as a result of our fixed rate debt and also our inflation indexation of our revenues.
In summary, in relation to our capital structure, I would like to emphasize the following points: a strong available liquidity position of EUR 2 billion, backlog of EUR 16 billion, no required short-term refinancing, loan maturities, highly attractive terms, a compelling business risk profile and no financing restrictions. And these give us access to several alternatives to fund growth. Cash from ongoing operations, this structure grants access to a wide array of debt instruments, financing a project level and also potential equity finance at the OpCo level.
On Slide 14, we are presenting to you the main characteristics of our first convertible bond we issued in January. For us, the issuance has been a landmark transaction, allowing us to diversify our funding sources, extend our maturities and reduce our average cost of debt, with the highest conversion premium in Europe.
And finally, just a few words on financial outlook in Slide 15. We have beaten our 2017 guidance by delivering on all the different contribution lines.
On the right-hand side, you can also find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the year. You can see the positive impact of the new TV channels being reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as, of course, the change of perimeter. These, altogether, explain the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 22%.
Moving to our 2018 financial outlook. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 405 million and EUR 415 million. We believe we can provide a recurring level free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2017. Our CapEx guidance remains unchanged, and dividends will increase by 10% as per our current dividend policy.
And with this, we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. And please note that, in the following slides, you will also find the frequently asked questions that all of you, you raised to the company, and also in our website, a very thorough Excel sheet. And on top of that, of course, the annual accounts with every single detail. Thank you very much."

Looking at your numbers, it looks that build to suit have consumed around EUR 52 million of CapEx.

So if you can just give us a bit of color as how the profile for BTS CapEx would evolve in the next couple of years? And then the second one is tied up on this one, because for the first time also provide the upside the BTS project gives to you. And it's pretty difficult to grasp from a chart, sort of, EBITDA you're thinking to achieve in 2023 for BTS with WIG. And that will be good if you can give us a bit of colors on a number, even if a range. And that number -- that include any additional BTS that could be triggered by the [indiscernible] announcement in January. And the very last one, it's basically on your free cash flow and EBITDA guidance. You're guiding for an EBITDA that -- midrange a guidance will be in excess of 15% and free cash flow above 10. Now you also tell that maintenance CapEx will remain relatively in line as percentage of sales. And you kept the interest rates lower in the recent financing. So I was wondering it's -- any reasons for us to assume that free cash, will it grow less than EBITDA into the New Year.

Yes, you are right, you are right, I think that when we give the guidance of record level free cash flow, we say to you more than 10%. More than 10% does not mean 10% or 11%. We do think that evolution of EBITDA and evolution of recurrent free cash flow will be coherent. So there is nothing related to working capital. There is nothing relating to tax that also will be in the same line. There is nothing related to cap -- maintenance CapEx that we are saying circa 3%. It is the only thing that you have to estimate well it's the interest expense. So it's quite straightforward. I think that, again, that we are a proven company.

We have several windows of transferring existing sites, this is why our towers in France are growing because of our agreement we have with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    WIG Telecom. And then on top of that, there's a 5-year program in order to end up building this 1,200 sites for -- with Telecom. Given that we don't really have feasibility on -- when we will be having these towers in place, that's why we believe that this process will be gradual. But in the case the final feature in terms of EBITDA is the sum of the different trenches we have already announced we are working. On the asset. Its upside, I mean. This is a very recent news for us. We believe that it's an opportunity. We -- as you know we already have an industrial partnership with WIG in France. So anything we can do for them we will continue to do so and with other operators as well. It's a matter of -- to win is if we find the right angle, happy to help them."

You were allowed, by statutory or by board approval, to issue a convertible of EUR 750 million. You issued EUR 600 million, does it imply that without having additional board approval you can issue the remaining EUR 150 million?

According to the Spanish law, the maximum delegation is EUR 750 million. This is in fact the delegation that the Board of Director of Cellnex has. As you suggest, once we have issued 600 million, our current delegation for convertible bonds accounts for EUR 150 million. So yes, you are right, with your math. Regarding the debt and the capacity to go into more debt. So we have answered these questions every single quarter. And it's a good question, but I think that it has to be framed in the right context. And in -- I do think that when we talk about net debt EBITDA, when we talk about leverage, we have to frame this within the business risk profile of the company. The business risk profile of Cellnex since the last 3 years has changed dramatically, has improved significantly. And this has allow us to maintain or to improve our net debt EBITDA, to increase our net debt EBITDA and at the same time maintaining a very similar or the same credit quality. We have prepare some slides, 21, 22, 23 and 24, to answer the question. If I go to the key point, I will say to you when accessing debt leverage of Cellnex, please note that we do have EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. And this means 7x our net debt. This is a first concept, I will say. Second, please note that our business risk profile is very strong. It's not excellent yet, but it's very strong. And you know that as the more strong business risk profile is the better or the higher the net debt can be. So our management, all the team is focused on improving the business risk profile. And finally, in Slide 23, you will find our capacity to delever the company every single year. You can see that these accounts for 0.6x net debt EBITDA of the leverage every year. So all of this is helpful when estimating the potential sell power of Cellnex. I think that this slide give answer to you."

Can you talk a little bit about how the -- what's the underlying service site leasing revenue trends are? And also about how we should think about the comps as we go into 2018 presumably that business can go back to top line growth hopefully. The second question is the deal you've made with [indiscernible] on managing the motorway sites. How come it became a management agreement rather than the straight, sort of, acquisition of the sites? Is this just sort of a try out how it works and you can do more similar deals, or was this just basically an opportunity that came up and you went for it?"

We'll be commercializing them, and that -- than we'll have revenue shared in the connection employees. In any case, we are not expecting a significant impact in opportunistic, and we are happy with the outcome. On Italy, you need to remember that when we presented the Galata transaction, there were 3 different ledgers. So revenues from wind, one is the base fee, second is the electricity fee and the third piece is the LTE revenues, they have station works for the network. In 2015, we didn't adapt as many towers as we would apply. We caught up in 2016, so we manage to adapt all of the sites plan for the year, plus those we couldn't in 2015. And in 2017, we are coming back to a normalized level. So hence, that -- I would say that this decline in this specific service is offsetting -- is offset by organic growth. So that's why you don't really see the increase in revenues. We do have the organic growth, we do have CommsCon format, but slight decline in the LTE revenues, we are coming -- we are receiving from wind. On the decommissioning, well you know that we have 2 different agreements in place and you should be seeing the progress in this year in 2018."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start this presentation highlighting the main milestones of the year, a year that has been marked by a strong execution and market recognition.
First of all, I have to say that we are continuing to deliver on organic performance, reaching the upper part of our guidance for 2017. If you remember, our guidance was from 3% to 4%, and we reached 4% -- we have reached 4%.
We are continuing generating a strong leverage free cash flow, growing a solid 10% in the year. Third, we are managing a sustainable business model that today offer EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. So as a result of young and long-term contracts that improved our business file.
We are executing on our equity story by growing in new and in existing markets and reinforcing our industrial partnership with key players. As you know, we are consolidating our market positioning in Spain and The Netherlands. We are executing several transactions in France, in all the countries where we are today.
The fourth part is related with the structural flexibility on our approach to fund financing growth, with around EUR 2 billion of available liquidity and a very efficient capital structure. As you can see, we are talking about maturities beyond 6 years and an average cost a bit below 2%.
And finally, we believe that the quality of this execution has been recognized by the market, with a share price that has increased 56% in year 2017.
On Slide #5, you can see a very strong performance on our key value metrics, with our adjusted EBITDA growing annually around 25% and our recurring leverage free cash flow per share growing annually at the similar rate over the last 2, 3 years.
If we move to Slide #6, we are showing you a summary of the principal of the 8 deals we have executed in 2017. All in all, we have added 8,000 sites to our footprint on a pro forma basis, and we have committed a total enterprise value of around EUR 2 billion, and we have multiplied our portfolio size since our IPO by 4x.
It's very important to highlight that the European sector is accelerating on our view. The Cellnex project trying to reach a European platform. So we are envisaging as well '18 -- 2018 with a very positive perspective.
On Slide #7, we can see the results of our growth strategy, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure rather than almost 80% when -- in 2014.
Around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA is generated outside of Spain in a pro forma basis. So all in all, we are transforming a single-country company in a single or mainly a broadcasting company in a telecom outsourcing infrastructure company, and really an international and a European company.
You can see in the left side of this slide the spread of our footprint across the countries where we are delivering today our services.
And well, I pass the floor to José Manuel to move to the business performance."

Moving to Slide 9.

Moving to Slide 9. Total PoPs have increased 22% in the period, including the contribution of both organic and change of perimeter in the year.
If we now focus on organic growth only, PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance between 3% and 4%.
Finally, DAS or DAS nodes, have increased 26% in the year, and we are optimistic that this new business area will become a significant contributor to Cellnex' revenues in the future. Please note, that this is the beginning of 5G.
Moving to Slide 10. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic PoPs year-on-year basis, reaching a customer ratio of 1.55. A change of perimeter is also considered, usually contributing with a lower ratio.
Additionally, we are implementing several commercial initiatives to secure future organic growth. We're strengthening our partnership with key customers. We are working under existing framework agreements to secure new tenants. We are implementing new small cell projects and exploring opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. Finally, Cellnex has been certified as Zero Outage Supplier by Deutsche Telekom.
Let me now please explain on Slide 11 our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been a strong circa 80%, with a significant margin expansion of 400 basis points in our EBITDA margin.
Moving to revenues. The contribution from telecom services and broadcasting increased, with a very well-managed cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 22%.
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is slightly positive. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of end of the year, and taxes reflect our management measures in place. All in all, we are providing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to 2016.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 12. It is important to highlight the strong liquidity position of the company. With circa-2 billion after the issuance of our first convertible bond in January and the very high level of contracted revenues, with a backlog of EUR 16 billion, or in other words, 20 years of revenues or 7x our net debt.
Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash, and proceeds have been used in the execution of our growth strategy.
Cellnex leverage as of December 2017 reached 5.5x on a net debt EBITDA basis, which includes the full year contribution from the new transactions in both debt and adjusted EBITDA.
Moving toward capital structure on Slide 13. You can see our current debt maturity profile. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing before 2022, and we do have a strong protection against interest rate increases as a result of our fixed rate debt and also our inflation indexation of our revenues.
In summary, in relation to our capital structure, I would like to emphasize the following points: a strong available liquidity position of EUR 2 billion, backlog of EUR 16 billion, no required short-term refinancing, long maturities, highly attractive terms, a compelling business risk profile and no financing restrictions. And these give us access to several alternatives to fund growth. Cash from ongoing operations, this structure in tranches access to a wide array of debt instruments, financing a project level and also potential equity finance at the OpCo level.
On Slide 14, we are presenting to you the main characteristics of our first convertible bond we issued in January. For us, the issuance has been a landmark transaction, allowing us to diversify our funding sources, extend our maturities and reduce our average cost of debt, with the highest conversion premium in Europe.
And finally, just a few words on financial outlook in Slide 15. We have beaten our 2017 guidance by delivering on all the different contribution lines.
On the right-hand side, you can also find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the year. You can see the positive impact of the new TV channels being reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as, of course, the change of perimeter. These, altogether, explain the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 22%.
Moving to our 2018 financial outlook. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 405 million and EUR 415 million. We believe we can provide a recurring level free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2017. Our CapEx guidance remains unchanged, and dividends will increase by 10% as per our current dividend policy.
And with this, we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. And please note that, in the following slides, you will also find the frequently asked questions that all of you, you raised to the company, and also in our website, a very thorough Excel sheet. And on top of that, of course, the annual accounts with every single detail. Thank you very much."

And the very last one, it's basically on your free cash flow and EBITDA guidance. You're guiding for an EBITDA that -- midrange a guidance will be in excess of 15% and free cash flow above 10. Now you also tell that maintenance CapEx will remain relatively in line as percentage of sales. And you kept the interest rates lower in the recent financing. So I was wondering it's -- any reasons for us to assume that free cash, will it grow less than EBITDA into the New Year. There is anything, sort of, movements on working capital or taxes that could dilute the growth from EBITDA rather than just enhancing it?"

The second one is regarding the free cash flow and how it compares with EBITDA growth. Yes, you are right, you are right, I think that when we give the guidance of record level free cash flow, we say to you more than 10%. More than 10% does not mean 10% or 11%. We do think that evolution of EBITDA and evolution of recurrent level of free cash flow will be coherent. So there is nothing related to working capital. There is nothing relating to tax that also will be in the same line. There is nothing related to cap -- maintenance, CapEx that we are saying circa 3%. It is the only thing that you have to estimate well is the interest expense. So it's quite straightforward. I think that, again, that we are a proven company. We tend to maintain the information we give to you in this case, last year, so the main way to present things. And yes, you are right, everything will be coherent. In 1 year time you will see that you -- this question was right and the answer are so coherent. Maybe Juan Jose you can help us in the first block of questions?"

On the EUR 52 million, we have explained this quarter, the vast majority is devoted to the build to suit program. We have already announced with WIG Telecom. As you know, at the moment of the first field we announced the 1st of February, there were 2 tranches, the acquisition of 1,800 existing sites plus the construction of 1,200 sites.

So you are beginning to see the cost associated with that product.

On the first -- second question, the reason why we are providing [ acute ] is, well, to give the idea that this will be a [indiscernible] process, as I explained earlier.

And then on top of that, there's a 5-year program in order to end up building this 1,200 sites for -- with Telecom. Given that we don't really have feasibility on -- when we will be having these towers in place, that's why we believe that this process will be gradual. But in the case the final feature in terms of EBITDA is the sum of the different tranches we have already announced we are working. On the asset. Its upside, I mean. This is a very recent news for us. We believe that it's an opportunity. We -- as you know we already have an industrial partnership with WIG in France.

According to the Spanish law, the maximum delegation is EUR 750 million. This is in fact the delegation that the Board of Director of Cellnex has. As you suggest, once we have issued 600 million, our current delegation for convertible bonds accounts for EUR 150 million. So yes, you are right, with your math. Regarding the debt and the capacity to go into more debt. So we have answered these questions every single quarter. And it's a good question, but I think that it has to be framed in the right context. And in -- I do think that when we talk about net debt EBITDA, when we talk about leverage, we have to frame this within the business risk profile of the company. The business risk profile of Cellnex since the last 3 years has changed dramatically, has improved significantly. And this has allow us to maintain or to improve our net debt EBITDA, to increase our net debt EBITDA and at the same time maintaining a very similar or the same credit quality. We have prepare some slides, 21, 22, 23 and 24, to answer the question. If I go to the key point, I will say to you when accessing debt leverage of Cellnex, please note that we do have EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. And this means 7x our net debt. This is a first concept, I will say. Second, please note that our business risk profile is very strong. It's not excellent yet, but it's very strong. And you know that as the more strong business risk profile is the better or the higher the net debt can be. So our management, all the team is focused on improving the business risk profile. And finally, in Slide 23, you will find our capacity to delever the company every single year. You can see that these accounts for 0.6x net debt EBITDA of the leverage every year. So all of this is helpful when estimating the potential sell power of Cellnex. I think that this slide give answer to you."

Can you talk a little bit about how the -- what's the underlying service site leasing revenue trends are? And also about how we should think about the comps as we go into 2018 presumably that business can go back to top line growth hopefully. The second question is the deal you've made with [indiscernible] on managing the motorway sites. How come it became a management agreement rather than the straight, sort of, acquisition of the sites? Is this just sort of a try out how it works and you can do more similar deals, or was this just basically an opportunity that came up and you went for it?"

We'll be commercializing them, and that -- than we'll have revenue shared in the connection in place. In any case, we are not expecting a significant impact. We are opportunistic, and we are happy with the outcome. On Italy, you need to remember that when we presented the Galata transaction, there were 3 different ledgers. So revenues from wind, one is the base fee, second is the electricity fee and the third piece is the LTE revenues, they have station works for the network. In 2015, we didn't adapt as many towers as we would apply. We caught up in 2016, so we manage to adapt all of the sites plan for the year, plus those we couldn't in 2015. And in 2017, we are coming back to a normalized level. So hence, that -- I would say that this decline in this specific service is offsetting -- is offset by organic growth. So that's why you don't really see the increase in revenues. We do have the organic growth, we do have CommsCon performance, but slight decline in the LTE revenues, we are coming -- we are receiving from wind.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start this presentation highlighting the main milestones of the year, a year that has been marked by a strong execution and market recognition.
First of all, I have to say that we are continuing to deliver on organic performance, reaching the upper part of our guidance for 2017. If you remember, our guidance was from 3% to 4%, and we reached 4% -- we have reached 4%.
We are continuing generating a strong leverage free cash flow, growing a solid 10% in the year. Third, we are managing a sustainable business model that today offer EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. So as a result of young and long-term contracts that improved our business file.
We are executing on our equity story by growing in new and in existing markets and reinforcing our industrial partnership with key players. As you know, we are consolidating our market positioning in Spain and The Netherlands. We are executing several transactions in France, in all the countries where we are today.
The fourth part is related with the structural flexibility on our approach to fund financing growth, with around EUR 2 billion of available liquidity and a very efficient capital structure. As you can see, we are talking about maturities beyond 6 years and an average cost a bit below 2%.
And finally, we believe that the quality of this execution has been recognized by the market, with a share price that has increased 56% in year 2017.
On Slide #5, you can see a very strong performance on our key value metrics, with our adjusted EBITDA growing annually around 25% and our recurring leverage free cash flow per share growing annually at the similar rate over the last 2, 3 years.
If we move to Slide #6, we are showing you a summary of the principal of the 8 deals we have executed in 2017. All in all, we have added 8,000 sites to our footprint on a pro forma basis, and we have committed a total enterprise value of around EUR 2 billion, and we have multiplied our portfolio size since our IPO by 4x.
It's very important to highlight that the European sector is accelerating on our view. The Cellnex project trying to reach a European platform. So we are envisaging as well '18 -- 2018 with a very positive perspective.
On Slide #7, we can see the results of our growth strategy, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure rather than almost 80% when -- in 2014.
Around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA is generated outside of Spain in a pro forma basis. So all in all, we are transforming a single-country company in a single or mainly a broadcasting company in a telecom outsourcing infrastructure company, and really an international and a European company.
You can see in the left side of this slide the spread of our footprint across the countries where we are delivering today our services.
And well, I pass the floor to José Manuel to move to the business performance."

Moving to Slide 9. Total PoPs have increased 22% in the period, including the contribution of both organic and change of perimeter in the year.If we now focus on organic growth only, PoPs and our consoli",894,"Thank you, Tobías, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 9. Total PoPs have increased 22% in the period, including the contribution of both organic and change of perimeter in the year.
If we now focus on organic growth only, PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance between 3% and 4%.
Finally, DAS or DAS nodes, have increased 26% in the year, and we are optimistic that this new business area will become a significant contributor to Cellnex' revenues in the future. Please note, that this is the beginning of 5G.
Moving to Slide 10. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic PoPs year-on-year basis, reaching a customer ratio of 1.55. A change of perimeter is also considered, usually contributing with a lower ratio.
Additionally, we are implementing several commercial initiatives to secure future organic growth. We're strengthening our partnership with key customers. We are working under existing framework agreements to secure new tenants. We are implementing new small cell projects and exploring opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. Finally, Cellnex has been certified as Zero Outage Supplier by Deutsche Telekom.
Let me now please explain on Slide 11 our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been a strong circa 80%, with a significant margin expansion of 400 basis points in our EBITDA margin.
Moving to revenues. The contribution from telecom services and broadcasting increased, with a very well-managed cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 22%.
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is slightly positive. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of end of the year, and taxes reflect our management measures in place. All in all, we are providing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to 2016.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 12. It is important to highlight the strong liquidity position of the company. With circa-2 billion after the issuance of our first convertible bond in January and the very high level of contracted revenues, with a backlog of EUR 16 billion, or in other words, 20 years of revenues or 7x our net debt.
Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash, and proceeds have been used in the execution of our growth strategy.
Cellnex leverage as of December 2017 reached 5.5x on a net debt EBITDA basis, which includes the full year contribution from the new transactions in both debt and adjusted EBITDA.
Moving toward capital structure on Slide 13. You can see our current debt maturity profile. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing before 2022, and we do have a strong protection against interest rate increases as a result of our fixed rate debt and also our inflation indexation of our revenues.
In summary, in relation to our capital structure, I would like to emphasize the following points: a strong available liquidity position of EUR 2 billion, backlog of EUR 16 billion, no required short-term refinancing, long maturities, highly attractive terms, a compelling business risk profile and no financing restrictions. And these give us access to several alternatives to fund growth. Cash from ongoing operations, this structure in tranches access to a wide array of debt instruments, financing a project level and also potential equity finance at the OpCo level.
On Slide 14, we are presenting to you the main characteristics of our first convertible bond we issued in January. For us, the issuance has been a landmark transaction, allowing us to diversify our funding sources, extend our maturities and reduce our average cost of debt, with the highest conversion premium in Europe.
And finally, just a few words on financial outlook in Slide 15. We have beaten our 2017 guidance by delivering on all the different contribution lines.
On the right-hand side, you can also find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the year. You can see the positive impact of the new TV channels being reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as, of course, the change of perimeter. These, altogether, explain the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 22%.
Moving to our 2018 financial outlook. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 405 million and EUR 415 million. We believe we can provide a recurring level free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2017. Our CapEx guidance remains unchanged, and dividends will increase by 10% as per our current dividend policy.
And with this, we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. And please note that, in the following slides, you will also find the frequently asked questions that all of you, you raised to the company, and also in our website, a very thorough Excel sheet. And on top of that, of course, the annual accounts with every single detail. Thank you very much."

And this is the reason why I -- my comment was that we have a very good relationship, we have a strategic relationship. Of course, our partnership in Switzerland is not based on financial issues or financial objectives. Its more -- in order to get a real case, a real opportunity to know better each other.

Looking at your numbers, it looks that build to suit have consumed around EUR 52 million of CapEx. But I can't find a lot of details in terms of -- the towers been built and also some granularity about the future. You guide on maintenance and the growth CapEx, but I understand that BTS is not included. So if you can just give us a bit of color as how the profile for BTS CapEx would evolve in the next couple of years? And then the second one is tied up on this one, because for the first time also provide the upside the BTS project gives to you. And it's pretty difficult to grasp from a chart, sort of, EBITDA you're thinking to achieve in 2023 for BTS with WIG. And that will be good if you can give us a bit of colors on a number, even if a range. And that number -- that include any additional BTS that could be triggered by the [indiscernible] announcement in January. And the very last one, it's basically on your free cash flow and EBITDA guidance. You're guiding for an EBITDA that -- midrange a guidance will be in excess of 15% and free cash flow above 10. Now you also tell that maintenance CapEx will remain relatively in line as percentage of sales. And you kept the interest rates lower in the recent financing. So I was wondering it's -- any reasons for us to assume that free cash, will it grow less than EBITDA into the New Year. There is anything, sort of, movements on working capital or taxes that could dilute the growth from EBITDA rather than just enhancing it?"

Yes, you are right, you are right, I think that when we give the guidance of record level free cash flow, we say to you more than 10%. More than 10% does not mean 10% or 11%. We do think that evolution of EBITDA and evolution of recurrent level of free cash flow will be coherent. So there is nothing related to working capital. There is nothing relating to tax that also will be in the same line. There is nothing related to cap -- maintenance, CapEx that we are saying circa 3%. It is the only thing that you have to estimate well is the interest expense. So it's quite straightforward. I think that, again, that we are a proven company. We tend to maintain the information we give to you in this case, last year, so the main way to present things. And yes, you are right, everything will be coherent.

And then on top of that, there's a 5-year program in order to end up building this 1,200 sites for -- with Telecom. Given that we don't really have feasibility on -- when we will be having these towers in place, that's why we believe that this process will be gradual. But in the case the final feature in terms of EBITDA is the sum of the different tranches we have already announced we are working. On the asset. Its upside, I mean. This is a very recent news for us. We believe that it's an opportunity. We -- as you know we already have an industrial partnership with WIG in France.

As you suggest, once we have issued 600 million, our current delegation for convertible bonds accounts for EUR 150 million. So yes, you are right, with your math. Regarding the debt and the capacity to go into more debt. So we have answered these questions every single quarter. And it's a good question, but I think that it has to be framed in the right context. And in -- I do think that when we talk about net debt EBITDA, when we talk about leverage, we have to frame this within the business risk profile of the company. The business risk profile of Cellnex since the last 3 years has changed dramatically, has improved significantly. And this has allow us to maintain or to improve our net debt EBITDA, to increase our net debt EBITDA and at the same time maintaining a very similar or the same credit quality. We have prepare some slides, 21, 22, 23 and 24, to answer the question. If I go to the key point, I will say to you when accessing debt leverage of Cellnex, please note that we do have EUR 16 billion of contracted revenues. And this means 7x our net debt. This is a first concept, I will say. Second, please note that our business risk profile is very strong. It's not excellent yet, but it's very strong. And you know that as the more strong business risk profile is the better or the higher the net debt can be. So our management, all the team is focused on improving the business risk profile. And finally, in Slide 23, you will find our capacity to delever the company every single year. You can see that these accounts for 0.6x net debt EBITDA of the leverage every year. So all of this is helpful when estimating the potential sell power of Cellnex. I think that this slide give answer to you."

Can you talk a little bit about how the -- what's the underlying service site leasing revenue trends are? And also about how we should think about the comps as we go into 2018 presumably that business can go back to top line growth hopefully. The second question is the deal you've made with [indiscernible] on managing the motorway sites. How come it became a management agreement rather than the straight, sort of, acquisition of the sites? Is this just sort of a try out how it works and you can do more similar deals, or was this just basically an opportunity that came up and you went for it?"

We are opportunistic, and we are happy with the outcome. On Italy, you need to remember that when we presented the Galata transaction, there were 3 different ledgers. So revenues from wind, one is the base fee, second is the electricity fee and the third piece is the LTE revenues, they have station works for the network. In 2015, we didn't adapt as many towers as we would apply. We caught up in 2016, so we manage to adapt all of the sites plan for the year, plus those we couldn't in 2015. And in 2017, we are coming back to a normalized level. So hence, that -- I would say that this decline in this specific service is offsetting -- is offset by organic growth. So that's why you don't really see the increase in revenues. We do have the organic growth, we do have CommsCon performance, but slight decline in the LTE revenues, we are coming -- we are receiving from wind.

You look",690,"Thank you, Juan Gaitan, and good morning, everyone. And thank you so much for your time today. 
I will like to start underlying the main milestones of the period. Quarter that has been marked by solid execution, both operational and financial. 
You look, we continue to deliver on our organic performance, posting a solid organic growth in line with our guidance. We continue to generate strong recurring leverage [indiscernible], our main [indiscernible] growing at almost 10%. 
We continue to focus on finding new sources of organic growth. We are making process with Iliad, both in Italy and France and our framework agreement. We have conversations with Salt in Switzerland. We have reached an agreement with Sigfox to provide an IoT network in Switzerland and we are pursuing a number of small sales opportunities across Europe. 
For revenues and adjusted EBITDA, grow 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. Organic growth new deals and our efficiency plan contribute to our adjusted EBITDA margin improvement from 46% to 48%. And our win-win agreement with our staff in Spain has also been implemented. We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals working directly with key partners on a invested approach with the objective to achieve long-term agreements. We are working hard to execute very accretive projects in 2018. 
And finally, we are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. 
If we move to Slide #5, the total PoPs have increased 24% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. 
If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4% at the top-end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
And finally, the DS notes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe is more sales in DS will become more a significant contributor to Selects business in the future. 
Flipping Slide #6. You can see an update picture of the results of our growth strategy, with a round of 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
Today, we are present in 6 countries. Our portfolio will consist of 28,000 sites, therefore, becoming one of the main power operator worldwide in a number of sites. Slide #7. Just to provide some additional background, as you can see in this slide, the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014, with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow growing annually at around 20%, high speed that has doubled this magnitude over the period. 
Next slide, just to finish my section, a few words on corporate governance and the new proportion composition of the board to be approved at our annual general assembly that will take place on May 31. 
As you can see in the Slide #8, it has been proposed, the appointment of 2 new independent board members, bringing the total number from the current 10 to 12. 
Upon approval, the number of proprietary directors will remain at 4. And independent directors will reach up to 7, demonstrating the importance given to achieve a best-in-class corporate governance with a clear majority of independent directors and on track to meet the CNM recommendation in terms of female representation. 
It has been proposed for approval the appointment of [indiscernible], who was Managing Director of the GSMA between 2011 and 2015, and have developed -- had professional career in companies of the telecom sectors, such as France telecom, Orange Today, global 1 Communications and Equipment. And has a degree in mathematics, his pH in artificial intelligence and a degree in the communications engineering. 
It has also been proposed for approval, the appointment of María Luisa Guijarro, who has extensively developed her professional career at the Telefonica group, where she held positions including Global Marketing Manager, CEO of Terry's pain, Director of Marketing and Business Development and member of the executive committee in Spain as Head of Strategy and Quality. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, who will focus on the financial details of the period."

With increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1000 organic PoPs over over the last year, reaching a consolidated customer ratio of [ 1.54%], if we also considering change of perimeter, which usually contributes with the ratio close to 1%. Additionally, we have several commercial initiatives in place in order to secure future organic growth, whereas strengthening our partnership with existing customers. We're working and within our framework agreement to secure new tenants. 
We're expanding our relationship with existing technological partners in new countries. I will continue to explore opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense rural areas. 
On slide 11, you can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiency achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
Let me now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation on the slide 12. 
I would like to highlight that the cash conversion adjusted EBITDA into recurring level free cash flow has been, again, a strong to [ 80% ]. 
With a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis in terms of adjusted EBITDA from [ 46% to 48% ]. 
Moving to the table, the contribution of Telecom Infrastructure Services, coupled with the very well managed cost base, leased to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%. 
Maintenance Capex is below our guidance due to timing factors. Our change in working capital is slightly positive, interest paid reflect our current capital structure and taxes mostly reflect our management measures in place and the schedule of payments throughout the year. 
I think that also in the Q&A session, you will find an interesting benchmark regarding our recurring levered free cash flow conversion in full year 2017 compared to our PoPs. 
And in this space, which I think is page 16, you will see again that Cellnex is on the top of their peers, when talking about recurring leverage free cash flow conversion. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on the slide 13, it is important to highlight our strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and the significant level of contracted revenues, in other words, our backlog of EUR 16 billion or 20 years of revenues. Compared to the '17, our balance sheet reflect the increasing debt instruments and the associated cash, while proceeds have been devoted to the execution of our growth strategy. Balance ratio is around 5.5x, net debt analyzed EBITDA, including the full year contribution of neutral sections both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. 
Last but not least, I would like to move to slide 14, where you can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile. Our debt has average maturity of 6.1 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022 and our inflation revenues, plus our fixed rate debt provide us with a strong protection against the interest rate increases. 
In summary, I would like to emphasize a solid availability liquidity position, very high contracted revenues of (sic)[ EUR 15 billion] not short-term financing need, long maturities, highly attractive terms and a comparing business profile, with no financial constraints, no covenant, no pledge, no guarantees. And all these together, provide us with a wider rate of funding out Turner's and flexibility. 
Cash generated by current operations, this structure in states [indiscernible] business instruments, debt financing, [indiscernible] partners at prior level [indiscernible]. 
You will find further info in our frequently asked questions and also in the excel Sheet that we have provided to you in our website.

However, in the fourth quarter, in the same slide, you were adjusting upward by EUR 412 million. So I'll be interested to know what has changed in terms of the adjustments you made under IFRS 16?

The second one is on the broadcasting. It doesn't receive a lot of color or a lot of visibility during the call, but it has weak in recent quarters?

And this is a further step, which will be the presentation of -- hopefully, the presentation of these industrial annual accounts or big year and hard year account audited as of June 2018. 
What you can see Ottavio, it's back in November. The relationship, the crease of leverage was only 0.2x. Right now, the decrease of leverage after the implementation of IFRS 16 is 4.6x. So as we work IFRS 16, as we implement IFRS 16 with our numbers, we're able to fine tune and to reduce the impact and to reduce the impact of this IFRS 16 into our numbers. 
Or in other words, to improve the impact of IFRS 16 into our numbers. 
And this is the key point because right now, for instance, are factoring much more debt in our leverage. 
And while we are understanding from IFRS 16 is that, as we speak in slide 19, you will see that we only have EUR 400 million of more debt coming from IFRS 16. 
And also at the same time, we will have an improvement of our EBITDA in EUR 156 million. 
So if you divide EUR 400 million divided by EUR 156 million, you will have 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is less than of our current 5.5x. 
In other words fine-tuning profits that should end in June 2018, in which we will confirm and we will present to you audited numbers and what we're seeing is that we're working on a very right direction, and in other words, the net debt of Cellnex after implementation IFRS 16 will be less then currently we have presented to you."

I mean, when we approach an opportunity, we like to understand the benefits, the value creation at the end of this transaction. I mean, beyond M&A, we like to talk about return of investments. Why? Because sometimes we are seeing that some opportunities, let me say, are so expensive. I understand that we like very much M&A, we like very much inorganic growth. But sometimes, mainly, the best investment is on your current customers. Why? Because you are improving your customer, your loyalty, you're improving your backlog, you are reducing your risk in the meaning of -- you have a track record with your customer.

But first of all, it's to serve our current customers. You know sometimes it's very difficult to define the border between organic or inorganic growth because when we talk about hedge computing, fiber optics, small cells, it depends on the final CapEx allocation. This is the reason why we don't want to sacrifice, let me say in that way, our firepower just for growth, just for inorganic growth.

I will like to start underlying the main milestones of the period, a quarter that has been marked by solid execution, both operational and financial. 
You look, we continued to deliver on our organic performance, posting a solid organic growth in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main valuation metric, growing at a robust 10%. 
We continue to focus on finding new sources of organic growth. We are making process with Iliad, both in Italy and France, and our framework agreements. We have conversations with Salt in Switzerland. We have reached an agreement with Sigfox to provide an IoT network in Switzerland and we are pursuing a number of small sales opportunities across Europe.
For revenues and adjusted EBITDA, grow 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. Organic growth new deals and our efficiency plan contribute to our adjusted EBITDA margin improvement from 46% to 48%. And our win-win agreement with our staff in Spain has also been implemented. We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, working directly with key partners on an industrial approach with the objective to achieve long-term agreements. We are working hard to execute value-accretive projects in 2018. 
And finally, we are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. 
If we move to Slide #5, the total PoPs have increased 24% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4%, at the top-end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
And finally, the DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe is more sales on DAS will become more a significant contributor to Cellnex's business in the future. 
Flipping to Slide #6. You can see an update picture of the results of our growth strategy, with around of 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
Today, we are present in 6 countries. Our portfolio will consist of 28,000 sites, therefore, becoming one of the main independent power operator worldwide in number of sites.
Slide #7. Just to provide some additional background, as you can see in this slide, the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014, with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow growing annually at around 20%, at a speed that has doubled this magnitude over the period. 
Next slide, just to finish my section, a few words on corporate governance and the new proportion composition of the board to be approved at our annual general assembly that will take place on May 31. 
As you can see in the Slide #8, it has been proposed the appointment of 2 new independent board members, bringing the total number from the current 10 to 12. 
Upon approval, the number of proprietary directors will remain at 4. And independent directors will reach up to 7, demonstrating the importance given to achieve a best-in-class corporate governance with a clear majority of independent directors and on track to meet the CNMV recommendation in terms of female representation. 
It has been proposed for approval the appointment of Anne Bouverot, who was Managing Director of the GSMA between 2011 and 2015, and have developed -- had professional career in companies of the telecom sectors such as France Telecom, Orange today, Global One Communications and Equant. Anne has a degree in mathematics, is a [ Ph. ] in artificial intelligence and a degree in telecommunications engineering. 
It has also been proposed for approval, the appointment of María Luisa Guijarro, who has extensively developed her professional career at the Telefonica group, where she held positions including Global Marketing Manager, CEO of Terra Spain, Director of Marketing and Business Development, and member of the executive committee in Spain as Head of Strategy and Quality. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, who will focus on the financial details of the period."

Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1,000 or",661,"Thank you, Tobias, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1,000 organic PoPs over the last year, reaching a consolidated customer ratio of 1.54 if we also considering change of perimeter, which usually contributes with a ratio close to 1. Additionally, we have several commercial initiatives in place in order to secure future organic growth. We are strengthening our partnership with existing customers. We're working under our framework agreements to secure new tenants. We're expanding our relationship with existing technological partners in new countries. And we continue to explore opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. 
On Slide 11, you can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
Let me now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period on the Slide 12. 
I would like to highlight that the cash conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been again a strong circa 80%, with a
a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis in terms of adjusted EBITDA from 46% to 48%. 
Moving to the table, the contribution of Telecom Infrastructure Services, coupled with a very well managed cost base, leads to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%. 
Maintenance Capex is below our guidance due to timing factors. Our change in working capital is slightly positive, interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes mostly reflect our management measures in place and the schedule of payments throughout the year. 
I think that also in the Q&A session, you will find an interesting benchmark regarding our recurring levered free cash flow conversion in full year 2017 compared to our peers. 
And in this page, which I think is page 16, you will see again that Cellnex is on the top of their peers, when talking about recurring levered free cash flow conversion. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on the Slide 13, it is important to highlight our strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and the significant level of contracted revenues, in other words, our backlog of EUR 16 billion or 20 years of revenues. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet will mostly reflect the increasing debt instruments and the associated cash, while proceeds have been devoted to the execution of our growth strategy. Debt to EBITDA ratio is around 5.5x, net debt analyzed EBITDA, including the full year contribution of new constructions both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. 
Last but not least, I would like to move to Slide 14, where you can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile. Our debt has an average maturity of 6.1 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022, and our inflation mix revenues plus our fixed rate debt provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increases. 
In summary, I would like to emphasize a solid available liquidity position, very high contracted revenues of EUR 15 billion (sic) [ EUR 16 billion ], no short-term financing need, long maturities, highly attractive terms and a competitive business risk profile, with no financial constraints, no covenant, no pledge, no guarantees. And all these together provide us with a wider rate of funding alternatives and flexibility, cash generated by current operations, this a structure and a status, alternative [indiscernible] instruments, debt financing, or equity partners at prior levels,  among others.

In the presentation, you mentioned that you will be adopting the standards in H1 2018. I double-checked the changes at least you made between the fourth quarter slides and the first one, and I've seen that the pro forma debt on under IFRS 16 has been adjusted upwards by EUR 392 million. However, in the fourth quarter, in the same slide, you were adjusting upwards by EUR 512 million. So I'll be interested to know what has changed in terms of the adjustments you make under IFRS 16? Why did debt increase? Basically it has been scaled back by almost EUR 120 million, despite anyway the overall debt has increased. 
The second one is on the broadcasting. It doesn't receive a lot of color or a lot of visibility during the call, but has been relatively weak in recent quarters. And I've seen that most start on Q3, and ever since you kept on the same growth rate and change. So is that a case that, that particular impact will fade starting from Q3 '18 when we basically lap that effect that you had in 2017, and therefore, broadcasting can start stabilizing?
And the clarification is from your provision. You have 2 different figures on the press release and on the slides. In the press release, you mentioned EUR 55 million provision; in the slides you mentioned EUR 60 million. I believe that potentially the EUR 60 million includes something else.

And there is a third step, which will be the presentation of -- hopefully, the presentation of the [indiscernible] annual accounts or big year and hard year accounts audited as of June 2018. What you can see, Ottavio, is back in November, the relationship, our decrease of leverage was only 0.2x. Right now, the decrease of leverage after the implementation of IFRS 16 is 4.6x. So as we work IFRS 16, as we implement IFRS 16 with our numbers, we're able to fine tune and to reduce the impact, and to reduce the impact of this IFRS 16 into our numbers. Or in other words, to improve the impact of IFRS 16 into our numbers. And this is the key point, because right now you see us, for instance, are factoring much more debt in our leverage. And what we are understanding from IFRS 16 is that, as we speak in Slide 19, you will see that we only have EUR 400 million of more debt coming from IFRS 16. And also at the same time, we will have an improvement of our EBITDA in EUR 156 million. So if you divide EUR 400 million divided by EUR 156 million, you will have this 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is less than our current 5.5x. 
In other words, fine-tuning profit, that should end in June 2018, in which we will confirm and we will present to you audited numbers.

Third, regarding our new shareholder, Edizione Holding. Well, first of all, I have to say clearly that we are very happy having Edizione Holding as a major holder. And why?

In some cases, something we do is to provide handsets to our customers, firemen, policemen and it's an area that -- a very low margin activity, basically we resell handsets to our customers. So when we post more activity, also there's unassociated cost linked into that. And that is what's explaining the increases, for example, as we saw in Q4 2017 and now the decline in Q1 2018. In any case, I would say that going forward, these evolution we're expecting quarterly is what you're seeing today, with some increases and decreases based on these different performance of the subactivities we provide.

Because you are improving your customer, your loyalty, you're improving your backlog, you are reducing your risk in the meaning of you have a track record with your customer.

This is the reason why we don't want to sacrifice, let me say in that way, our firepower just for growth, just for inorganic growth. And your second question was related, if I'm not wrong, about organic growth?"

You look,",699,"Thank you, Juan Jo, and good morning, everyone. And thank you so much for your time today. 
I will like to start underlying the main milestones of the period, a quarter that has been marked by solid execution, both operational and financial. 
You look, we continued to deliver on our organic performance, posting a solid organic growth in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main valuation metric, growing at a robust 10%. 
We continue to focus on finding new sources of organic growth. We are making process with Iliad, both in Italy and France, and our framework agreements. We have conversations with Salt in Switzerland. We have reached an agreement with Sigfox to provide an IoT network in Switzerland and we are pursuing a number of small sales opportunities across Europe.
For revenues and adjusted EBITDA, grow 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. Organic growth new deals and our efficiency plan contribute to our adjusted EBITDA margin improvement from 46% to 48%. And our win-win agreement with our staff in Spain has also been implemented. We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, working directly with key partners on an industrial approach with the objective to achieve long-term agreements. We are working hard to execute value-accretive projects in 2018. 
And finally, we are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. 
If we move to Slide #5, the total PoPs have increased 24% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4%, at the top-end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
And finally, the DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe is more sales on DAS will become more a significant contributor to Cellnex's business in the future. 
Flipping to Slide #6. You can see an update picture of the results of our growth strategy, with around of 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
Today, we are present in 6 countries. Our portfolio will consist of 28,000 sites, therefore, becoming one of the main independent power operator worldwide in number of sites.
Slide #7. Just to provide some additional background, as you can see in this slide, the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014, with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow growing annually at around 20%, at a speed that has doubled this magnitude over the period. 
Next slide, just to finish my section, a few words on corporate governance and the new proportion composition of the board to be approved at our annual general assembly that will take place on May 31. 
As you can see in the Slide #8, it has been proposed the appointment of 2 new independent board members, bringing the total number from the current 10 to 12. 
Upon approval, the number of proprietary directors will remain at 4. And independent directors will reach up to 7, demonstrating the importance given to achieve a best-in-class corporate governance with a clear majority of independent directors and on track to meet the CNMV recommendation in terms of female representation. 
It has been proposed for approval the appointment of Anne Bouverot, who was Managing Director of the GSMA between 2011 and 2015, and had developed -- had professional career in companies of the telecom sectors such as France Telecom, Orange today, Global One Communications and Equant. Anne has a degree in mathematics, is a [ Ph. ] in artificial intelligence and a degree in telecommunications engineering. 
It has also been proposed for approval, the appointment of María Luisa Guijarro, who has extensively developed her professional career at the Telefonica group, where she held positions including Global Marketing Manager, CEO of Terra Spain, Director of Marketing and Business Development, and member of the executive committee in Spain as Head of Strategy and Quality. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, who will focus on the financial details of the period."

Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter.

Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1,000 organic PoPs over the last year, reaching a consolidated customer ratio of 1.54 if also considering change of perimeter, which usually contributes with a ratio close to 1. Additionally, we have several commercial initiatives in place in order to secure future organic growth. We are strengthening our partnership with existing customers. We're working under our framework agreements to secure new tenants. We're expanding our relationship with existing technological partners in new countries. And we continue to explore opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. 
On Slide 11, you can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
Let me now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period on the Slide 12. 
I would like to highlight that the cash conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been again a strong circa 80%, with a
a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis in terms of adjusted EBITDA from 46% to 48%. 
Moving to the table, the contribution of Telecom Infrastructure Services, coupled with a very well managed cost base, leads to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%. 
Maintenance Capex is below our guidance due to timing factors. Our change in working capital is slightly positive, interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes mostly reflect our management measures in place and the schedule of payments throughout the year. 
I think that also in the Q&A session, you will find an interesting benchmark regarding our recurring levered free cash flow conversion in full year 2017 compared to our peers. 
And in this page, which I think is page 16, you will see again that Cellnex is on the top of their peers, when talking about recurring levered free cash flow conversion. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on the Slide 13, it is important to highlight our strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and the significant level of contracted revenues, in other words, our backlog of EUR 16 billion or 20 years of revenues. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increasing debt instruments and the associated cash, while proceeds have been devoted to the execution of our growth strategy. Debt to EBITDA ratio is around 5.5x, net debt analyzed EBITDA, including the full year contribution of new transactions both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. 
Last but not least, I would like to move to Slide 14, where you can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile. Our debt has an average maturity of 6.1 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022, and our inflation mix revenues plus our fixed rate debt provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increases. 
In summary, I would like to emphasize a solid available liquidity position, very high contracted revenues of EUR 15 billion (sic) [ EUR 16 billion ], no short-term financing need, long maturities, highly attractive terms and a competitive business risk profile, with no financial constraints, no covenant, no pledge, no guarantees. And all these together provide us with a wider rate of funding alternatives and flexibility, cash generated by current operations, this a structure and a status, alternative [indiscernible] instruments, debt financing, or equity partners at prior levels,  among others. 
You will find further info in our frequently asked questions and also in the Excel sheet that we have provided to you in our website. 
And with all this, we are now available to answer any questions. So please, let's open the lines."

On your second question on M&A CapEx, it's true that we have posted EUR 111 million of M&A CapEx. Basically the drop-down is around EUR 3 million for the acquisition of 85 sites in Spain as mobile.

In the presentation, you mentioned that you will be adopting the standards in H1 2018. I double-checked the changes at least you made between the fourth quarter slides and the first one, and I've seen that the pro forma debt on under IFRS 16 has been adjusted upwards by EUR 392 million. However, in the fourth quarter, in the same slide, you were adjusting upwards by EUR 512 million. So I'll be interested to know what has changed in terms of the adjustments you make under IFRS 16? Why did debt increase? Basically it has been scaled back by almost EUR 120 million, despite anyway the overall debt has increased. 
The second one is on the broadcasting. It doesn't receive a lot of color or a lot of visibility during the call, but has been relatively weak in recent quarters. And I've seen that most start on Q3, and ever since you kept on the same growth rate and change. So is that a case that, that particular impact will fade starting from Q3 '18 when we basically lap that effect that you had in 2017, and therefore, broadcasting can start stabilizing?
And the clarification is from your provision. You have 2 different figures on the press release and on the slides. In the press release, you mentioned EUR 55 million provision; in the slides you mentioned EUR 60 million. I believe that potentially the EUR 60 million includes something else. So if you can basically say what's the difference between the EUR 55 million that is mostly Spain and the EUR 60 million that potentially could have also some headcount reduction across Europe."

On broadcasting, you will find in Q1 2018, if you compare that to Q4 2017, you will see a slight increase. So in our view, we've seen the bottom in Q4 2017. Of course, if you compare year-on-year, you will continue finding declines, but I will say that at Q4 should give you the floor and from Q1, you can start seeing a more stable performance.

And there is a third step, which will be the presentation of -- hopefully, the presentation of the [indiscernible] annual accounts or big year and hard year accounts audited as of June 2018. What you can see, Ottavio, is back in November, the relationship, our decrease of leverage was only 0.2x. Right now, the decrease of leverage after the implementation of IFRS 16 is 4.6x. So as we work IFRS 16, as we implement IFRS 16 with our numbers, we're able to fine tune and to reduce the impact, and to reduce the impact of this IFRS 16 into our numbers. Or in other words, to improve the impact of IFRS 16 into our numbers. And this is the key point, because right now you see us, for instance, are factoring much more debt in our leverage. And what we are understanding from IFRS 16 is that, as we speak in Slide 19, you will see that we only have EUR 400 million of more debt coming from IFRS 16. And also at the same time, we will have an improvement of our EBITDA in EUR 156 million. So if you divide EUR 400 million divided by EUR 156 million, you will have this 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is less than our current 5.5x. 
In other words, fine-tuning profit, that should end in June 2018, in which we will confirm and we will present to you audited numbers. And what we're seeing is that we're working on the very right direction, and in other words, the net debt of Cellnex after implementation IFRS 16 will be less than currently we have presented to you."

In some cases, something we do is to provide handsets to our customers, firemen, policemen and it's an area that -- a very low margin activity, basically we resell handsets to our customers. So when we post more activity, also there's unassociated cost linked into that. And that is what's explaining the increases, for example, as we saw in Q4 2017 and now the decline in Q1 2018. In any case, I would say that going forward, these evolution we're expecting quarterly is what you're seeing today, with some increases and decreases based on these different performance of the subactivities we provide.

You're now explicitly referencing a live dialogue with Salt in Switzerland, which is promising from an organic growth perspective. And you've also signed up a [ SyncOps ] operator there too. So it would be useful to be reminded of how much headroom you have to your tenancy ratio under the current omissions rules in Switzerland. And finally, from where I sit, I'm seeing some skepticism being expressed as to whether the MSA approach will actually remain -- will be sustainable in mobile operators as a way of avoiding IFRS lease capitalization implications.

IFRS 16 should be implemented on a early stage this year, but I think Cellnex will be the only company in Europe that will do it.

For us, it's not just a question of countries, geographies. I mean, when we approach an opportunity, we like to understand the benefits, the value creation at the end of this transaction. I mean, beyond M&A, we like to talk about return of investments. Why? Because sometimes we are seeing that some opportunities, let me say, are so expensive. I understand that we like very much M&A; we like very much inorganic growth. But sometimes, mainly, the best investment is on your current customers. Why? Because you are improving your customer, your loyalty, you're improving your backlog, you are reducing your risk in the meaning of you have a track record with your customer. So you know very well how does it work in the meaning of day-by-day operations. And this is the reason why we're paying a lot of attention in order to work with our current customers, and maybe this is not just -- it's not always very attractive. Let me say attractive in the meaning of M&A, relevant highlights in the press release. But being with our customers it's very relevant when we have to face also an important change of technology from 4G to 5G. And this is the reason why for us, the main objective, the main priorities is to serve our current customers, to work with them and then to find synergies in the current 6 countries where we are. But first of all, it's to serve our current customers. Sometimes it's very difficult to define the border between organic or inorganic growth, because when we talk about hedge computing, fiber optics, small cells, it depends on the final CapEx allocation. This is the reason why we don't want to sacrifice, let me say in that way, our firepower just for growth, just for inorganic growth.

You look,",698,"Thank you, Juan Jo, and good morning, everyone. And thank you so much for your time today. 
I will like to start underlying the main milestones of the period, a quarter that has been marked by solid execution, both operational and financial. 
You look, we continued to deliver on our organic performance, posting a solid organic growth in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main valuation metric, growing at a robust 10%. 
We continue to focus on finding new sources of organic growth. We are making process with Iliad, both in Italy and France, and our framework agreements. We have conversations with Salt in Switzerland. We have reached an agreement with Sigfox to provide an IoT network in Switzerland and we are pursuing a number of small sales opportunities across Europe.
For revenues and adjusted EBITDA, grow 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. Organic growth new deals and our efficiency plan contribute to our adjusted EBITDA margin improvement from 46% to 48%. And our win-win agreement with our staff in Spain has also been implemented. We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, working directly with key partners on an industrial approach with the objective to achieve long-term agreements. We are working hard to execute value-accretive projects in 2018. 
And finally, we are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. 
If we move to Slide #5, the total PoPs have increased 24% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4%, at the top-end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
And finally, the DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe is more sales on DAS will become more a significant contributor to Cellnex's business in the future. 
Flipping to Slide #6. You can see an update picture of the results of our growth strategy, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
Today, we are present in 6 countries. Our portfolio will consist of 28,000 sites, therefore, becoming one of the main independent power operator worldwide in number of sites.
Slide #7. Just to provide some additional background, as you can see in this slide, the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014, with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow growing annually at around 20%, at a speed that has doubled this magnitude over the period. 
Next slide, just to finish my section, a few words on corporate governance and the new proportion composition of the board to be approved at our annual general assembly that will take place on May 31. 
As you can see in the Slide #8, it has been proposed the appointment of 2 new independent board members, bringing the total number from the current 10 to 12. 
Upon approval, the number of proprietary directors will remain at 4. And independent directors will reach up to 7, demonstrating the importance given to achieve a best-in-class corporate governance with a clear majority of independent directors and on track to meet the CNMV recommendation in terms of female representation. 
It has been proposed for approval the appointment of Anne Bouverot, who was Managing Director of the GSMA between 2011 and 2015, and had developed -- had professional career in companies of the telecom sectors such as France Telecom, Orange today, Global One Communications and Equant. Anne has a degree in mathematics, is a [ Ph. ] in artificial intelligence and a degree in telecommunications engineering. 
It has also been proposed for approval, the appointment of María Luisa Guijarro, who has extensively developed her professional career at the Telefonica group, where she held positions including Global Marketing Manager, CEO of Terra Spain, Director of Marketing and Business Development, and member of the executive committee in Spain as Head of Strategy and Quality. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, who will focus on the financial details of the period."

Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1,000 or",659,"Thank you, Tobias, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 10, you can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have started around 1,000 organic PoPs over the last year, reaching a consolidated customer ratio of 1.54 if also considering change of perimeter, which usually contributes with a ratio close to 1. Additionally, we have several commercial initiatives in place in order to secure future organic growth. We are strengthening our partnership with existing customers. We're working under our framework agreements to secure new tenants. We're expanding our relationship with existing technological partners in new countries. And we continue to explore opportunities to provide densification solutions in dense urban areas. 
On Slide 11, you can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
Let me now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period on the Slide 12. 
I would like to highlight that the cash conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow has been again a strong circa 80%, with a
a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis in terms of adjusted EBITDA from 46% to 48%. 
Moving to the table, the contribution of Telecom Infrastructure Services, coupled with a very well managed cost base, leads to an adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%. 
Maintenance Capex is below our guidance due to timing factors. Our change in working capital is slightly positive, interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes mostly reflect our management measures in place and the schedule of payments throughout the year. 
I think that also in the Q&A session, you will find an interesting benchmark regarding our recurring levered free cash flow conversion in full year 2017 compared to our peers. 
And in this page, which I think is Page 16, you will see again that Cellnex is on the top of their peers when talking about recurring levered free cash flow conversion. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on the Slide 13, it is important to highlight our strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and the significant level of contracted revenues, in other words, our backlog of EUR 16 billion or 20 years of revenues. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increasing debt instruments and the associated cash, while proceeds have been devoted to the execution of our growth strategy. Debt to EBITDA ratio is around 5.5x, net debt analyzed EBITDA, including the full year contribution of new transactions both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. 
Last but not least, I would like to move to Slide 14, where you can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile. Our debt has an average maturity of 6.1 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022, and our inflation mix revenues plus our fixed rate debt provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increases. 
In summary, I would like to emphasize a solid available liquidity position, very high contracted revenues of EUR 15 billion (sic) [ EUR 16 billion ], no short-term financing need, long maturities, highly attractive terms and a competitive business risk profile, with no financial constraints, no covenant, no pledge, no guarantees. And all these together provide us with a wider rate of funding alternatives and flexibility, cash generated by current operations, this a structure and a status, alternative [indiscernible] instruments, debt financing, or equity partners at prior levels, among others. 
You will find further info in our frequently asked questions and also in the Excel sheet that we have provided to you in our website. 
And with all this, we are now available to answer any questions. So please, let's open the lines."

In the presentation, you mentioned that you will be adopting the standards in H1 2018. I double-checked the changes at least you made between the fourth quarter slides and the first one, and I've seen that the pro forma debt on under IFRS 16 has been adjusted upwards by EUR 392 million. However, in the fourth quarter, in the same slide, you were adjusting upwards by EUR 512 million. So I'll be interested to know what has changed in terms of the adjustments you make under IFRS 16? Why did debt increase? Basically it has been scaled back by almost EUR 120 million, despite anyway the overall debt has increased. 
The second one is on the broadcasting. It doesn't receive a lot of color or a lot of visibility during the call but has been relatively weak in recent quarters. And I've seen that most start on Q3, and ever since you kept on the same growth rate and change. So is that a case that, that particular impact will fade starting from Q3 '18 when we basically lap that effect that you had in 2017, and therefore, broadcasting can start stabilizing?
And the clarification is from your provision. You have 2 different figures on the press release and on the slides. In the press release, you mentioned EUR 55 million provision; in the slides you mentioned EUR 60 million. I believe that potentially the EUR 60 million includes something else. So if you can basically say what's the difference between the EUR 55 million that is mostly Spain and the EUR 60 million that potentially could have also some headcount reduction across Europe."

And there is a third step, which will be the presentation of -- hopefully, the presentation of the [indiscernible] annual accounts or big year and hard year accounts audited as of June 2018. What you can see, Ottavio, is back in November, the relationship, our decrease of leverage was only 0.2x. Right now, the decrease of leverage after the implementation of IFRS 16 is 4.6x. So as we work IFRS 16, as we implement IFRS 16 with our numbers, we're able to fine tune and to reduce the impact, and to reduce the impact of this IFRS 16 into our numbers. Or in other words, to improve the impact of IFRS 16 into our numbers. And this is the key point, because right now you see us, for instance, are factoring much more debt in our leverage. And what we are understanding from IFRS 16 is that, as we speak in Slide 19, you will see that we only have EUR 400 million of more debt coming from IFRS 16. And also at the same time, we will have an improvement of our EBITDA in EUR 156 million. So if you divide EUR 400 million divided by EUR 156 million, you will have this 3x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is less than our current 5.5x. 
In other words, fine-tuning profit, that should end in June 2018, in which we will confirm and we will present to you audited numbers. And what we're seeing is that we're working on the very right direction, and in other words, the net debt of Cellnex after implementation IFRS 16 will be less than currently we have presented to you."

So basically, what you see is the [indiscernible] contribution of our several activities at the same time that we report under this line.

In some cases, something we do is to provide handsets to our customers, firemen, policemen and it's an area that -- a very low margin activity, basically we resell handsets to our customers. So when we post more activity, also there's unassociated cost linked into that. And that is what's explaining the increases, for example, as we saw in Q4 2017 and now the decline in Q1 2018. In any case, I would say that going forward, these evolution we're expecting quarterly is what you're seeing today, with some increases and decreases based on these different performance of the subactivities we provide.

Because you are improving your customer, your loyalty, you're improving your backlog, you are reducing your risk in the meaning of you have a track record with your customer.

PoPs have increased 4% at the top and of our medium-term",1107,"Thank you, Tobias. Moving to Slide 8. Total PoPs have increased 23% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. 
We will focus on organic growth only. PoPs have increased 4% at the top and of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
Finally, DAS notes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe that experience we are gathering in the area of DAS -- identification solutions will translate into significant business in the future. 
On Slide 9, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have in place to secure the future organic growth. In summary, we are levering on CommsCon credentials to deploy more projects in the area of DAS and small sales, car parks, football stadiums, transport networks. And we are doing all these in the current footprint -- in the current 6 countries in which the company is present. 
Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy, in line with our expectations, and we believe that we can expand these very good relationships into new markets. 
We are providing a new hybrid TV platform for our national customers in Spain. Therefore, increasing the attractiveness of DDT. 
And finally, we are happy to confirm that the Spanish Ministry of Economy is planning to maintain the current number of DDT multiples in the context of the second digital dividend, in line also with our expectations. You will find all the initiatives that the companies is pursuing in Slide 9 and that I find very interesting. 
So moving to Slide 10, you can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and savings is reinforced by the contribution of our new deals, which has placed the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
The dark blue column on the right represent a positive impact of rehabilitation of IFRS 16 and adjusted -- at adjusted EBITDA level, reaching EUR 291 million in the period. 
If we move to the next slide, I will provide more details on the impact from this accounting change. Please note that this accounting change is the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And Cellnex what is trying to do is to be a pioneer, not only in our balance sheet impact but also on managing the impacts of IFRS 16 and our clients. This is key. We are learning, and we are  somehow being innovative and at the same time, following the rule, the accounting rule as it is defined because we'll think this is going to give us competitive advantage. 
Finally, just about IFRS 16 and before moving to Slide 11, let me remark that IFRS 16 will allow the comparability of Cellnex with other companies in the sector and at the same time, with other companies in other sectors. We will see this on Slide 11, where you can see that our recurring level free cash flow does not change at all. But of course, you can see the effects. Adjusted EBITDA increases because leases disappear from the OpEx line and a new line below adjusted EBITDA, payment of lease liabilities appears that offset these effect at cash level. 
And finally, our net debt increases as well as a result of the capitalization of the leases. This is all consistent with the company's view before the adoption of IFRS 16. I already shared in the market in previous presentations. So at the end of the day, IFRS 16, allows Cellnex to be comparable with other fees that all more land than us, and this is crucial. Now we are comparable in terms of EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA margin and in terms of net debt EBITDA. 
Let me now move to our recurrent level free cash flow generation in the period on Slide 12. I would like to highlight that on the IFRS 16, our revenues grow 16% and our adjusted EBITDA by 20% and also, that our EBITDA margin reaches 69%. A significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to last year. I would like -- also moving out on the table, the contribution of telecom subsidiaries coupled with a very well-managed cost base leads to adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%, as already mentioned. 
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to management measures implemented. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure. And taxes reflect our initiatives in place and the schedule of payments during the year. And as a result, we can present to you our growth of recurring cash flow by 14% in the first 6 months of the year, which I think this a very good news for our shareholders. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 13. It is important to highlight that the adoption of IFRS 16 provides better comparability with peers because it equalizes the treatment of plant ownership and the management of ground leases between for a month different periods in towering. 
Cellnex [indiscernible] ratio reaches 4.8x, 4.8x net debt/annualized EBITDA, including the full year contribution of new transactions as well as the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instrument and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues. Backlog of EUR 16 million or in other words, 20 years of revenues. 
Now, moving to Slide 14. We can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile excluding the capitalization of leases as explained earlier. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinancing reflected before 2022 and our link revenues plus our fixed rate debt more than 80%, provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increase and also provide us with a very flexible financing structure. 
So in summary, I would emphasize a strong position of other level liquidity, contracted revenues of EUR 16 billion, no short term refinancial required, low maturities, highly attractive terms, no pledge, no hedge, no covenant. Our compelling business is profiled [indiscernible] of any kind. 
All of these provide us with a rate of funding alternatives, cash generated by current operations, destructuring several states, alternatives that instruments debt financing or equity, among all others. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

On 1 side, it is 5G deployment, which is something that will require the additional capacity that will be distributed from each one of our site will require a better back holding to the tower. That's 1 element. And the second is the typology of the site. So when we look at the typology of the site, probably, the areas with more than, let's say, needs of coverage are requiring that. Specifically, rooftops. As you know, we are active on rooftop deployment, especially on the roof [indiscernible] in France, and this is potentially requiring fiber on the coming years when looking at the 5G needs. As of now, the level of fiber and I think your question was, specifically, in relation to Spain, we decided in this recent acquisition that we are announcing some detail on Page 22, the fiber, which is not very high in terms of introduction on our side, belongs in those cases where exist to our clients. And we are having agreements on helping our clients to commercialize it, but it's not -- let me put it like yet our fiber. With this recent acquisition, we are starting to becoming more active on that field. We  as you'll perceive also in some of the slides at the end of the presentation, we see these acquisition as in the past, it was CommsCon. That was the platform that was helping us to understand a new segment of products that potentially, step-by-step, could be deployed in other regions. And that's basically the rationale that it is behind this recent acquisition in the fiber domain. The second question I understand was related to Italy and how it's actually -- the demand of Iliad performing. What we can say is that, there is a high activity on our operational teams on deploying points of presence for Iliad very much in line on the previous guide is that we already been sharing with you guys. So in that sense, we are delivering, technically wise, the things that are already in ground rate -- let's say this type of relationship with the things of our client. And we are in line on what we are expecting."

And secondly, the multiple that you pay for that assets is obviously quite low, and that seems to be because actually has a concession to operate fiber doesn't actually own a fiber itself. Have you negotiated any option to buy the spectrum? By the fiber, the expiry of the current concession in 2031?

I think most of sales our peers, when looking at the fiber, we are approaching it from that strategic angle on how the additional capacity is going to be required and how we will deliver these top holding to our site in the future. So clearly, the natural extension on our value chain, that comes immediately after the pure cycle location is the basic element. It has a second element, which is for us, quite important. When you have fiber, you are and sometimes, we even joke around that the fiber is like the root of a site. Why? Because it makes and sticks the 3, which is antenna closer to the site and the commercial -- commercialization capacity and the long-term partnership that you're going to establish with our client is logically longer, and you have this additional step that enclouds you to create this loyalty with your partner. So strategically wise, maybe it's not exactly the same as [indiscernible] as you were potentially suggesting, but it's not different very much. In that sense, we are looking for that fiber, but in some cases, we are finding as well that some of the clients are thinking on potentially having connectivity. And this is where we are also getting that know-how with that recent acquisition. Concerning that acquisition, you're right, the multiple being shown on Page 22 is an interesting 1 in comparison to all that transactions. But you are right, also pointing there is a concession there. And this concession is ending on 2031. Potentially, the client we have there and the concessionaire being public entity may require future deployments that will be a part of potential future discussions that we may have concerning the final [indiscernible] As of today, the final date is at 2031 and this is the end of [indiscernible] on the multiple that we have paid."

So of course, I mean, we've had a very open dialogue with rating agencies, and we have been sharing with them and all our work. And I think, and as all we know, the Canadian system, initially this kind of changes in the methodologies is not something that can happen from 1 day to the other. This take time. And naturally, it takes time for us to explain the details, to explain the context. IFRS 16 is going to be something that is very important to the financial ecosystem, which is that net debt EBITDA margins are going to be more comparable than before. And therefore, it is my feeling that adjustments that rating agencies tend to execute should be reviewed under the impact of IFRS 16. So if your question is yes, or no, I would say to you, my view is not yet. But I'm pretty sure that [indiscernible] in the very well positioned to obtain a very good outcome of these discussions, on a very good outcome of the implementation of IFRS 16. Please note, that IFRS 16 as of June 2018 will be mandatory for other companies. Therefore, it will be very difficult to track the information, would be very difficult do adjustments for everyone. IFRS 16 has a lot of [indiscernible] information from the companies, much more information that can be obtained from rating agencies and from any investor within the other accounts. So here, there are several details that will have to be assessed by rating agencies. By the way, one of them is -- has opened a paper discussion paper, and we are working this discussion paper, which is public so that we can give our views and obviously, to share the benefits of IFRS 16. And you're talking about the 6.5x net debt EBITDA. Well, again, it's linked to the previous 1. It's not white or black. It's just a question of explaining to the financial community that the standard of the net debt EBITDA are in the process of being changed. So as long as the different stakeholders understand these changes, as long as IFRS 16 is implemented, I would think we'll see the same rating. We'll see the same parameters, we should have more leverage capacity. This is my view. But again, we are at a level turf, we are working in the very rare direction. We have to go step-by-step. And as soon as we get more good outcome, we will share with you. But please, and there is something very important here, Ottavio. We have to -- it's also about -- it's our capacity of leverage is not only our ratio. It is our business profile. And as you can see, quarter after quarter, our business profile is improving.

Because when we talk about these type of issues, we have to talk about governance. First of all, I would like to underline that for me, personally speaking, as the CEO of the company, I am a firm believer of the 2 roles. I mean, in terms of governance, I like very much to keep the independency between the board and the executive directors and the executive senior team here. And this is the reason why I am supportive of this structure in terms of governance, and I got through the Chairman of the Board and CEO because we were handling -- if I may say, in the way the transition from [indiscernible] to this new shareholder like [indiscernible] holding. Second important thing for me is a that Edizione Holding has a very firm and strong commitment with this strategy and the equity story of growth of Cellnex. So these fits extremely, extremely very well for the execution of our strategy. And the third one is not just related with legal entities like Edizione Holding or Cellnex is related with individuals. As you said before, we are talking about Marco Park 1 or as an individual. Marco Park 1 is a very, very reputated and very experienced senior management. He was a CFO, he was CEO, he knows very well our industry. And therefore, the board -- but I have to -- I would like to understand myself. We have been very supportive on this appointment because taken into consideration these 3 main principles made a lot of sense to keep this governance that we had since our IPO, havening a nonexecutive Chairman of the Board and a CEO because we and I understand that this is the best for the project. This is the best for the governance of the company. And this is the best for clarity in front of you, in front of the investors and that's it anything else behind of that. So I'm very happy, personally speaking, I would like to tell you very, very -- in a transparent way, I'm very happy with that because again, we really believe that this is the best for the company. This is the best for the future. Second question about the Dutch market, maybe Alex could help me, but you know how where we're anchored customer today's KPN. We are following the evolution on the transition on the KPN and management team and you know that well T-Mobile and [indiscernible] to are under a potential -- let me put on that way, merge process. Therefore, I have to say, first of all, the Netherlands remains the strategy for us. And therefore, we are pursuing all the evolution, all the opportunities on the Netherlands. So it means that keep on our priorities, on our top priorities, but we have to find the right opportunity. I don't know, Alex, do you want to add something more?"

So this is one of the first elements that we are intending to do on those countries where we have a basic service. We have -- let's say, expanding our portfolio with the rest of the services that we have. So this certification by the regional government for being Cellnex, the Dutch supplier that we are out of the shelf -- let say, partner is reasonable outcome on this line. The third question, I can take it. Tobias if you want, on the JVs, I think it is important, Emmett, to realize that many of those JVs are basically acting, sharing agreements. Active equipment sharing agreements with -- among [indiscernible] Tobias, what do you think?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. I will start underlining the main milestone of the period, and again, a quarter of solid execution, both from operational and financial point of view. 
We continue to deliver on organic performance, posting a solid organic growth in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main value creation metric, growing at a robust 14%. 
We have adopted the new accounting standard, IFRS 16. This allows us to improve our leverage ratio, but please, bear in mind, that there is no impact at cash flow level. The process of looking for new growth opportunities never stops. And as a result, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of a fiber optic network in Spain that will enhance our service offering for mobile operators. 
As we have insisted, we maintain the ambition to play a key role in the 5G value chain, and this new transaction fits perfectly while in this strategy and complements our current portfolio of services. 
We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, and we are closely working with key partners on an investor approach to execute value-accretive projects in 2018.  
We are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018, and finally, I would stress that revenues and adjusted EBITDA grow at around 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. 
If we move to Slide #5. It's very well known to you and shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 to 2018. And as you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leveraged free cash flow have been growing at around 20% annually. And this role is the reason behind these metrics doubling in size in 4 years. 
On Slide #6, you can graphically see the result of our growth strategy and our diversification efforts. With around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
We are, today, one of the main independent tower operators worldwide in number of sites, with presence in 6 countries and a portfolio that will consist of 28,000 sites, and the best is yet to come. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide financial details of the period."

Total PoPs have increased 23% in the period including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. We will focus on organic growth only. PoPs have increased 4% at the top end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
Finally, DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe that the experience we are gathering in the area of DAS small cells identification solutions will translate into significant business in the future. 
On Slide 9, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have in place to secure future organic growth. 
In summary, we are levering on CommsCon credentials to deploy more projects in the area of DAS and small cells, car parks, football stadiums, transport networks. And we are doing all these in the current footprint -- in the current 6 countries in which the company is present. 
Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy, in line with our expectations, and we believe that we can expand these very good relationships into new markets. 
We are providing a new hybrid TV platform for our national customers in Spain, therefore, increasing the attractiveness of DTT. 
And finally, we are happy to confirm that the Spanish Ministry of Economy is planning to maintain the current number of DTT multiples in the context of the second digital dividend, in line also with our expectations. You will find all the initiatives that the company is pursuing in Slide 9 and that I find very interesting. 
So moving to Slide 10. You can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and savings and [indiscernible] is reinforced by the contribution of our new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
The dark blue column on the right represent the positive impact of the adaptation of IFRS 16 and adjusted -- at adjusted EBITDA level, reaching EUR 291 million in the period. 
If we move to the next slide, I will provide more details on the impact from this accounting change. Please note that this accounting change is the most important change in accountancy in the last years. In Cellnex, what it's trying to do is to be a pioneer not only in our balance sheet impact but also on managing the impacts of IFRS 16 in our clients. This is key. We are learning and we are  somehow being innovative and, at the same time, following the rule, the accounting rule as it is defined because we do think this is going to give us competitive advantage. 
Finally, just about IFRS 16. And before moving to Slide 11, let me remark that IFRS 16 will allow the comparability of Cellnex with other companies in the sector and, at the same time, with other companies in other sectors. We will see this on Slide 11, where you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow does not change at all, but of course, you can see 2 effects: adjusted EBITDA increases because leases disappear from the OpEx line; and a new line below adjusted EBITDA, payment of lease liabilities appears that offset this effect at cash level. And finally, our net debt increases as well as a result of the capitalization of the leases. This is all consistent with the company's view before the adoption of IFRS 16 already shared with the market in previous presentations. So at the end of the day, IFRS 16 allows Cellnex to be comparable with other fees that own more land than us, and this is crucial. Now we are comparable in terms of EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA margin and in terms of net debt EBITDA. 
Let me now move to our recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period on Slide 12. I would like to highlight that on the IFRS 16, our revenues rose 16% and our adjusted EBITDA by 20% and also, that our EBITDA margin reaches 59%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to last year. 
I would like -- also moving now on the table, the contribution of telecom infrastructure service, coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%, already mentioned. 
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to management measures implemented. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes reflect our initiatives in place and the schedule of payments during the year. And as a result, we can present to you our growth of recurring levered free cash flow by 14% in the first 6 months of the year, which I do think is a very good news for our shareholders. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 13. It is important to highlight that the adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers because it equalized the treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases between or among different peers in towering. 
Cellnex area ratio reaches 4.8x, 4.8x net debt annualized EBITDA including the full year contribution of new transactions as well as the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, backlog of EUR 16 billion or, in other words, 20 years of revenues. 
Now moving to Slide 14. You can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile excluding the capitalization of leases [indiscernible] explained earlier. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinance is expected before 2022, and our inflation linked revenues plus our fixed rate debt, more than 80%, provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increase and also provide us with a very flexible financing structure. 
So in summary, I would emphasize a strong position of our level liquidity, contracted revenues of EUR 16 billion, no short-term refinancing required, low maturities, highly attractive terms, no pledge, no hedge, no covenant. Our compelling business we profiled are not financial constraints of any kind. 
All of these provide us with a way to rate our funding alternatives, cash generated by current operations, [indiscernible] structure and salary [indiscernible], alternatives debt instruments, debt financing or equity partners [indiscernible] level among all others. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

And secondly, in Italy, it looks like there's an uptick in site. Is this the [ HS ] program with Wind Tre now starting to pick up? Is it going to spend a bit perhaps in the last couple of years? A competitor is flagging they may have seen a slowdown in business from Wind Tre. I was wondering if that's been focusing more on their own portfolio and the new build-to-suit plan that they have for themselves and maybe also a benefit from the Iliad rollout too? Can we expect ancillary EBITDA to potentially grow quicker than it did last year? And then finally, just a quick one on DAS.

On one side, it is 5G deployment, which is something that will require the additional capacity that will be distributed from each one of our site will require a better bank holding to the tower. That's one element. And the second is the typology of the site. So when we look at the typology of the site, probably the areas with more than, let's say, needs of coverage are requiring that, specifically, rooftops. As you know, we are active on rooftop deployment, especially on the [indiscernible] in France, and this is potentially requiring fiber on the coming years when looking at the 5G needs. As of now, the level of fiber and I think your question was, specifically, in relation to Spain, we decided this is a recent acquisition that we are announcing and there was some detail on Page 22. The fiber, which is not very high in terms of introduction on our side, belongs in those cases where exist to our clients. And we are having agreements on helping our clients to commercialize it, but it's not -- let me put it like that, yet, our fiber. With this recent acquisition, we are starting to becoming more active on that field.  as you will perceive also in some of the slides, at the end of the presentation, we see this acquisition, as in the past, it was CommsCon, that was the platform that was helping us to understand a new segment of products that potentially, step by step, could be deployed in other regions. And that's basically the rationale that it is behind this recent acquisition in the fiber domain."

The Crown Castle fiber strategy has been to buy dark fiber with the anticipation of deploying small cell networks on top of it. It doesn't sound like that is the strategy you will be pursuing, because you couldn't confirm that? And secondly, the multiple that you pay for that asset is obviously quite low and that seems to be because access here, actually in the other concession to operate fiber doesn't actually own a fiber itself. Have you negotiated any option to buy the spectrum -- not the spectrum -- buy the fiber, the expiry of the current concession in 2031? And then finally -- we've now finally seen KKR take a major step forward in its European ambitions, finally pursuing an asset beyond Telxius. It will be interesting to hear your thoughts on how you would like to see market structure evolve in European talents over the medium and long term.

So you are correct. So I think most of sales of most of our peers, when looking at the fiber, we are approaching it from that strategic angle on how the additional capacity is going to be required and how we will deliver these top holding to our site in the future. So clearly, the natural extension on our value chain, that comes immediately after the pure site colocation. This is the basic element, which has a second element, which is, for us, quite important. When you have fiber, you are -- and sometimes, we even joke around that the fiber is like the root of a site. Why? Because it makes and sticks the tree, which is antenna, closer to the site and the commercialization capacity and the long-term partnership that you can establish with our clients is logically longer, and you have this additional step that encouraged you to create this loyalty with your partner. So strategically wise, maybe it's not exactly the same as Crown Castle as you were potentially suggesting, but it's not differing very much. In that sense, we are looking for that fiber, but in some cases, we are finding as well that some of the clients are thinking on potentially having connectivity. And this is where we are also getting that know-how with that recent acquisition. Concerning that acquisition, you're right. The multiple being shown on Page 22 is an interesting one in comparison to other transactions. But you are right also pointing that there is a concession there, and this concession is ending on 2031. Potentially, the client we have there and the concessionaire being a public entity may require future deployments that will be a part of potential future discussions that we may have concerning the final date. But as of today, the final date is 2031 and this is being reflected on the multiple that we have paid."

Third, we have a lot of experience on the -- in Europe on the operations.

The one that the agency used when they assessed your credit rating at 7.7 [indiscernible] Now I believe that probably the credit agency didn't have all the information you provided to your auditors. So my question is that, are you currently engaging with credit agencies on that? Do you reckon that could basically lead to reviewing about your gearings as they calculate themselves? And on that one, in the past, you basically mentioned quite a few times the cap to your gearing at 6.5x, beyond which, you don't want to use your balance sheet. Today, with the IFRS 16, you've gone from 5.5 to 4.8. So my question is that, is the 6.5 standing? Or are you going to review that one? The second one, it's basically following on the previous answer. You basically mentioned about KKR having a quite different business model from yours. I would actually say it's very complementary to yours. They're looking for minority financial stakes. You're looking for control in industrial rationale. So my question is that, considering that at some stage, you're going to exhaust your balance sheet room in terms of how much gearing you can put, what stoped you for actually partnering with KKR and, basically, perceived future transaction together? American Tower is ready to do with PGGM in Europe. So I was just wondering how it would work with you and KKR or if you've already been talking to one another. And the very last one, it's on the provision. This quarter, you used significant portion of the EUR 55 million you provisioned last quarter. So that means that the headcount or the savings from headcount restructuring you were basically thinking to achieve by 2020 could be cut earlier than that."

Now regarding your 2 first questions are very -- both of them are very linked because at the end of the day, rating assessment and the net debt EBITDA somehow are linked. So let's go to IFRS 16 and rating assessment. So of course, I mean, we've had a very open dialogue with the rating agencies and we have been sharing with them and all our work. And I think, and as all we know, the Canadian system, initially this kind of changes seen in their methodologies, nothing that can happen from 1 day to the other. This takes time. And sure it takes time for us to explain the details, to explain the context. IFRS 16 is going to be something very important to the financial ecosystem, which is that the net debt EBITDA -- the EBITDA margins are going to be more comparable than before. And therefore, it is my feeling that adjustments that rating agencies tend to execute should be reviewed under the impact of IFRS 16. So if your question is yes or no, I would say to you, my view is not yet. But I'm pretty sure that [indiscernible] and are very well positioned to obtain a very good outcome of this discussion on a very good outcome of the implementation of IFRS 16. Please note, that IFRS 16 as of June 2018 will be mandatory for other companies. Therefore, it will be very difficult to track the information, will be very difficult to do adjustments for everyone. IFRS 16 has a lot of taking account the kind of information from the companies, much more information that can be obtained from rating agencies and from any investor within the other accounts. So here, there are several details that will have to be assessed by rating agencies. By the way, one of them is -- has opened a paper -- discussion paper, and we are working the discussion paper, which is public, so that we can give our views and, obviously, to share the benefits of IFRS 16. You're talking about the 6.5x net debt EBITDA. Well, again, it's linked to the previous one. It's not white or black. It's just a question of explaining to the financial community that the standard or the net debt EBITDA are in the process of being changed. So as long as the different stakeholders understand these changes, as long as IFRS 16 is implemented, I would think that we've seen the same rating. We've seen the same parameters. We should have more leverage capacity. This is my view. But again, we are at level turf. We are working in the very right direction. We have to go step by step. And as soon as we get more good outcome, we will share with you. But please, and there is something very important here, Ottavio and we have talked -- it's also about -- our capacity of leverage is not only our ratio. It is our business risk profile. And as you can see, quarter after quarter, our business risk profile is improving. Our business risk profile is more diversified and this is also very helpful. So it's not only IFRS 16. It's rather cost and business risk profile. So..."

Now I know it's very early days, Tobias, but I'm just wondering what benefits do you believe Mr. Patuano can bring to Cellnex as the new Chairman of the company? The second question relates to the Dutch market, and you've obviously -- it's been a very active market for you over the last couple of years with Protelindo, with Shere and also with Alticom. And can you say are there any more targets out there you believe you can target in the Dutch towers market? And then lastly, just a big picture question. There's quite a few towers JVs in Europe. I'm thinking of infraco in France, the JV between Bouygues and SFR. There's also a couple of JVs here where I'm sitting in the U.K.. There's not a big JV, of course, in Poland between Orange and T-Mobile. I guess these JVs look attractive to you because there's 2 tenants per tower. But on the other side, perhaps negotiating with 2 shareholders can be a little bit more complicated. Can you say a few words about where and what the potential is for Cellnex to maybe penetrate this JV market over time?"

Because when we talk about this type of issues, we have to talk about governance. First of all, I would like to underline that for me, personally speaking, as the CEO of the company, I'm a firm believer of the 2 roles. I mean, in terms of governance, I like very much to keep the independency between the board and the executive directors and the executive senior team, and this is the reason why I am supportive of this structure in terms of governance. And I got to the Chairman of the Board and CEO because we were handling, if I may say, the way the transition from Abertis to this new shareholder like Edizione Holding. Second important thing for me is that Edizione Holding has a very firm and strong commitment with the strategy and the equity story of growth of Cellnex. So this fits extremely, extremely very well for the execution of our strategy. And the third one is not just related with legal entities like Edizione Holding or Cellnex is related with individuals. As you said before, we are talking about Marco Patuano as an individual. Marco Patuano is a very, very reputed and very experienced senior management. He was CFO. He was CEO. He knows very well our industry. And therefore, the board, but I have to -- I would like to understand myself, we have been very supportive on this appointment because taking into consideration these 3 main principles made a lot of sense to keep this governance that we had since our IPO, having a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and a CEO because we and I understand that this is the best for the project. This is the best for the governance of the company and this is the best for clarity in front of you, in front of the investors and that's it, anything else behind of that. So I'm very happy. Personally speaking, I would like to tell you very, very -- in a transparent way, I'm very happy with that because, again, we really believe that this is the best for the company. This is the best for the future. Second question about the Dutch market, and maybe Alex could help me, but you know that our anchor customer today is KPN. We are following the evolution on the transition on the KPN management team, and you know that, well, T-Mobile and Tele2, are under a potential -- let me put on that way, merge process. Therefore, I have to say, first of all, the Netherlands remains the strategy for us. And therefore, we are pursuing all the evolution, all the opportunities on the Netherlands. So it means that keep on our priorities, on our top priorities, but we have to find the right opportunity. I don't know. Alex, do you want to add something more?"

Let's say these merge process is freezing a little bit at our activity, especially with those 2 players. However, as we, let's say, briefly mentioned on Page 9, we've been certified by the regional government for being a certified Dutch supplier. So this is one of the first elements that we are intending to do on those countries where we have a basic service. We are, let's say, expanding our portfolio with the rest of services we have. So this certification by the regional government for being Cellnex, Dutch supplier, that we are out of the shelf, let's say, partner it is about outcome on this line. The third question, I can take it. Tobias if you want, on the JV. So I think it is important, Emmett, to realize that many of those JVs are basically active sharing agreements, active equipment sharing agreements with -- among MNOs. For instance, you mentioned infraco in France. So actually, in our portfolio of towers in France, we have infraco as a customer. Why? Because the 2 MNOs who are the members of that JV are having the ownership of the active equipment but not the passive infrastructure. So I would say, many -- probably most of these JVs around Europe are not taking into consideration the passive infrastructure, which is still remaining at each one MNO's balance sheet. So clearly, it's the first step for the MNOs on sharing. Clearly, also I know we said we believe with the future 5G requirements and CapEx wave, more sharing will come, and it is in the good direction in order, let's say, to put Cellnex value on the table."

And last question on Iliad, it is fantastic news that we are seeing some activity coming -- already coming from -- they integrated from them.

In relation to the potential future topology that we could envisage for the telecom operator, I would not say only mobile network operator, a telecom operator with a converged network, what we will see is that besides the capillarity that our sites may provide, they will need to communicate those towers with what they call metropolitan offices or central offices. Those are small data centers like mobile Edge computing would be the type of service that probably would be within a metropolitan office that will require the connectivity -- fiber connectivity from those small data centers to the final sites that today we are having. So the propositions that we believe we could do to our partners and even some of the propositions that we're having from some of our partners to analyze this, what and how we could be helpful on providing this connectivity and also on this type of small data centers. All this debate, that some of the -- our peers in the U.S., as someone who mentioned before, Crown Castle, are already very much into. So the fact of charging, clearly, yes. So there is a CapEx being deployed. Always, there is a return in terms of a fee being captured by the customer. In relation to Switzerland, yes. We've shared, let's say, after the transaction with it, some of the uncertainties that were around in Switzerland. One of them was the radio spectrum limitations that at the time of the acquisition, we were -- and some of you already asked about this potential limitation and we always say this is twofold because on one side, the tenancy ratio, maybe it's constrained a little bit. But then, since you cannot put a lot of prediction on a single tower, you need more towers. So there is also pros and cons around that. In relation to that specific radiation limitation, the situation is that it has not changed. The regulation remains as it was, and clearly, is one of the elements that the MNOs, globally, in Switzerland are putting on the table on the discussions, and this is public on the future 5G options that are considering with the Swiss government, whether this should be changed or not."

So the TV sets, as of today, are all connected TV sets, which potentially could have this sort of hybrid linear, nonlinear experience for the viewer. What we are doing is free of charge, which is very important. What we are doing is putting together all the nonlinear content of the broadcasting TV stations on a single platform that you can navigate without any set-top box, just with a remote control and playing with the teletext buttons on the remote control, the red button kind of experience, and changing from linear to nonlinear.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. I will start underlining the main milestone of the period. Again, a quarter of solid execution both from operational and financial point of view. 
We continue to deliver on organic performance, posting solid organic growth, in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main value creation metric, growing at a robust 14%. 
We have adopted the new accounting standard, IFRS 16. This allows us to improve our leverage ratio, but please, bear in mind that there is no impact at cash flow level. The process of looking for new growth opportunities never stops. And as a result, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of a fiber optic network in Spain that will enhance our service offering for mobile operators. 
As we have insisted, we maintain the ambition to play a key role in the 5G value chain, and this new transaction fits perfectly well in this strategy and complements our current portfolio of services. 
We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, and we are closely working with key partners on an investor approach to execute value-accretive projects in 2018.  
We are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. And finally, I would stress that revenues and adjusted EBITDA grow at around 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. 
If we move to Slide #5. It's very well known to you and shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 to 2018. And as you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leveraged free cash flow have been growing at around 20% annually. And this growth is the reason behind these metrics doubling in size in 4 years. 
On Slide #6, you can graphically see the result of our growth strategy and our diversification efforts, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
We are today one of the main independent tower operators worldwide in number of sites, with presence in 6 countries and a portfolio that will consist of 28,000 sites, and the best is yet to come. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide financial details of the period."

Total PoPs have increased 23% in the period including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. We will focus on organic growth only. PoPs have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
Finally, DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe that the experience we are gathering in the area of DAS, small cells and identification solutions will translate into significant business in the future. 
On Slide 9, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have in place to secure future organic growth. 
In summary, we are levering on CommsCon credentials to deploy more projects in the area of DAS and small cells, car parks, football stadiums, transport networks. And we are doing all these in the current footprint, in the current 6 countries in which the company is present. 
Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy, in line with our expectations, and we believe that we can expand these very good relationships into new markets. 
We are providing a new hybrid TV platform for our national customers in Spain, therefore increasing the attractiveness of DTT. 
And finally, we are happy to confirm that the Spanish Ministry of Economy is planning to maintain the current number of DTT multiples in the context of the second digital dividend, in line also with our expectations. You will find all the initiatives that the company is pursuing in Slide 9 and that I find very interesting. 
So moving to Slide 10. You can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and savings [indiscernible] is reinforced by the contribution of our new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
The dark blue column on the right represents the positive impact of the adaptation of IFRS 16 and adjusted -- at adjusted EBITDA level, reaching EUR 291 million in the period. 
If we move to the next slide, I will provide more details on the impact from this accounting change. Please note that this accounting change is the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And Cellnex, what it's trying to do is to be a pioneer not only in our balance sheet impact but also on managing the impacts of IFRS 16 in our clients. This is key. We are learning, and we know how being innovative and at the same time following the rule, the accounting rule as it is defined, because we do think this is going to give us competitive advantage. 
Finally, just about IFRS 16. And before moving to Slide 11, let me remark that IFRS 16 will allow the comparability of Cellnex with other companies in the sector and at the same time with other companies in other sectors. We will see this on Slide 11, where you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow does not change at all. But above, you can see 2 effects: adjusted EBITDA increases because leases disappear from the OpEx line; and a new line below adjusted EBITDA, payment of lease liabilities, appears that offset this effect at cash level. And finally, our net debt increases as well as a result of the capitalization of the leases. This is all consistent with the company's view before the adoption of IFRS 16 already shared with the market in previous presentations. So at the end of the day, IFRS 16 allows Cellnex to be comparable with other peers that own more land than us, and this is crucial. Now we are comparable in terms of EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA margin and in terms of net debt EBITDA. 
Let me now move to our recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period on Slide 12. I would like to highlight that on the IFRS 16 our revenues rose 16% and our adjusted EBITDA by 20% and also that our EBITDA margin reaches 59%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to last year. 
I would like also -- moving now on the table. The contribution of telecom infrastructure service, coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%, already mentioned. 
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to management measures implemented. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes reflect our initiatives in place and the schedule of payments during the year. And as a result, we can present to you our growth of recurring levered free cash flow by 14% in the first 6 months of the year, which I do think is a very good news for our shareholders. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 13. It is important to highlight that the adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers because it equalized the treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases between or among different peers in towering. 
Cellnex area ratio reaches 4.8x, 4.8x net debt annualized EBITDA including the full year contribution of new transactions as well as the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, backlog of EUR 16 billion or, in other words, 20 years of revenues. 
Now moving to Slide 14. You can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile excluding the capitalization of leases [ we already ] explained earlier. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinance is expected before 2022, and our inflation-linked revenues plus our fixed-rate debt, more than 80%, provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increase and also provide us with a very flexible financing structure. 
So in summary, I would emphasize a strong position of our level liquidity, contracted revenues of EUR 16 billion, no short-term refinancing required, low maturities, highly attractive terms, no pledge, no hedge, no covenant, a compelling business risk profile and no financial constraints of any kind. 
All of these provide us with a wide array of funding alternatives, cash generated by current operations, [indiscernible] structure and salary [indiscernible], alternatives debt instruments, debt financing or equity partners [indiscernible] level among all others. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

Here there are basically 2 elements that we believe are, let's say, triggering that need. On one side, it is 5G deployment, which is something that will require the additional capacity that will be distributed from each one of our site will require better backhauling to the tower. That's one element. And the second is the topology of the site. So when we look at the topology of the site, probably the areas with more than, let's say, needs of coverage are requiring that, specifically, rooftops. As you know, we are active on rooftop deployment, especially on the [indiscernible] work in France, and this is potentially requiring fiber on the coming years when looking at the 5G needs. As of now, the level of fiber -- and I think your question was specifically in relation to Spain, we decided this is a recent acquisition that we are announcing, and there was some detail on Page 22. The fiber, which is not very high in terms of introduction on our side, belongs in those cases where exist to our clients. And we are having agreements on helping our clients to commercialize it, but it's not -- let me put it like that, yet our fiber. With this recent acquisition, we are starting to becoming more active on that field.  We, as you will perceive also in some of the slides at the end of the presentation, we see this acquisition, as in the past it was CommsCon, that was the platform that was helping us to understand a new segment of products that potentially step by step could be deployed in other regions. And that's basically the rationale that it is behind this recent acquisition in the fiber domain."

Have you negotiated any option to buy the spectrum -- not the spectrum -- buy the fiber, the expiry of the current concession in 2031?

I think most of our sales of most of our peers when looking at the fiber we are approaching it from that strategic angle on how the additional capacity is going to be required and how we will deliver these backhauling to our site in the future. So clearly, the natural extension on our value chain, that comes immediately after the pure site co-location. This is the basic element. It has a second element which is for us quite important. When you have fiber, you are -- and sometimes, we even joke around that the fiber is like the root of a site. Why? Because it makes and sticks the tree, which is antenna, closer to the site and the commercialization capacity and the long-term partnership that you can establish with our clients is logically longer, and you have this additional step that it helps you to create this loyalty with your partner. So strategically wise, maybe it's not exactly the same as Crown Castle as you were potentially suggesting, but it's not differing very much. In that sense, we are looking for that fiber. But in some cases, we are finding as well that some of the clients are thinking on potentially having connectivity. And this is where we are also getting that know-how with that recent acquisition. Concerning that acquisition, you're right. The multiple being shown on Page 22 is an interesting one in comparison to other transactions. But you are right also pointing that there is a concession there, and this concession is ending on 2031. Potentially, the client we have there and the concessions there being public entity may require future deployments that will be a part of potential future discussions that we may have concerning the final date. But as of today, the final date is 2031, and this is being reflected on the multiple that we have paid."

So I'm not surprised there. What's surprising is that your capitalization rate is 2.6x. The one that the agency used when they assessed your credit rating at 7.7, at least from Fitch. Now I believe that probably the credit agency didn't have all the information you provided to your own auditors. So my question is that, are you currently engaging with credit agencies on that? Do you reckon that could basically lead to reviewing about your gearings as they calculate themselves? And on that one, in the past you basically mentioned quite a few times the cap to your gearing at 6.5x, beyond which you don't want to use your balance sheet. Today, with the IFRS 16, you've gone from 5.5 to 4.8. So my question is that, is the 6.5 standing? Or are you going to review that one? The second one it's basically following on the previous answer. You basically mentioned about KKR having a quite different business model from yours. I would actually say it's very complementary to yours. They're looking for minority financial stakes. You're looking for control in industrial [ rationale ]. So my question is that, considering that at some stage you're going to exhaust your balance sheet room in terms of how much gearing you can put, what stopped you for actually partnering with KKR and, basically, pursue future transaction together? American Tower already do with PGGM in Europe. So I was just wondering how it would work with you and KKR or if you've already been talking to one another. And the very last one, it's on the provision. This quarter, you used significant portions of the EUR 55 million you provisioned last quarter. So that means that the headcount -- or the savings from headcount restructuring you were basically thinking to achieve by 2020 could be cut earlier than that?"

Now regarding your 2 first questions are very -- both of them are very linked, now, because at the end of the day rating assessment and the net debt EBITDA somehow are linked. So let's go to IFRS 16 and rating assessment. So of course, I mean, we have a very open dialogue with the rating agencies, and we have been sharing with them all our work. And I think, and as all we know the Canadian system, initially this kind of changes seen in their methodologies it's nothing that can happen from one day to the other. This takes time. And also it takes time from us to explain the details, to explain the concepts. IFRS 16 is going to be something very important to the financial ecosystem, which is that the net debt EBITDA -- the EBITDA margins are going to be more comparable than before. And therefore, it is my feeling that adjustments that rating agencies tend to execute should be reviewed under the impact of IFRS 16. So if your question is yes or no, I would say to you my view is not yet. But I'm pretty sure that [ Ternsis ] is in a very well position to obtain a very good outcome of this discussion on a very good outcome of the implementation of IFRS 16. Please note that IFRS 16 as of June 2018 will be mandatory for all the companies. Therefore, it will be very difficult to track the information, will be very difficult to do adjustments for everyone. IFRS 16 has a lot of -- it's taking into account a lot of information from the companies, much more information that can be obtained from rating agencies and from any investor within the [indiscernible] accounts. So here, there are several details that will have to be assessed by rating agencies. By the way, one of them is -- has opened a paper, a discussion paper. And we are working the discussion paper, which is public, so that we can give our views and, obviously, to share the benefits of IFRS 16. You're talking about the 6.5x net debt EBITDA. Well, again, it's linked to the previous one. It's not white or black. It's just a question of explaining to the financial community that the standard for the net debt EBITDA are in the process of being changed. So as long as the different stakeholders understand these changes, as long as IFRS 16 is implemented, I do think that we've seen the same rating. We've seen the same parameters. We should have more leverage capacity. This is my view. But again, we early adopters. We are working in the very right direction. We have to go step by step. And as soon as we get more good outcome, we will share with you. But please, there are something very important here, Ottavio, we have to -- it's also about -- not it's -- our capacity of leverage is not only a ratio. It is our business risk profile. And as you can see, quarter after quarter, our business risk profile is improving. Our business risk profile is more diversified, and this is also very helpful. So it's not only IFRS 16. It's [ rather cost ] and business risk profile. So..."

The second question relates to the Dutch market. And you've obviously -- it's been a very active market for you over the last couple of years with Protelindo, with Shere and also with Alticom. And can you say are there any more targets out there you believe you can target in the Dutch towers market? And then lastly, just a big picture question. There's quite a few towers JVs in Europe. I'm thinking of infraco in France, the JV between Bouygues and SFR. There's also a couple of JVs here where I'm sitting in the U.K. And there's another big JV, of course, in Poland between Orange and T-Mobile. I guess these JVs look attractive to you because there's 2 tenants per tower. But on the other side, perhaps negotiating with 2 shareholders can be a little bit more complicated. Can you say a few words about where and what the potential is for Cellnex to maybe penetrate this JV market over time?"

Because when we talk about this type of issues, we have to talk about governance. First of all, I would like to underline that for me, personally speaking as the CEO of the company, I'm a firm believer of the 2 roles. I mean, in terms of governance, I like very much to keep the independency between the board and the executive directors and the executive senior team, and this is the reason why I am supportive of this structure in terms of governance. And I got to the Chairman of the Board and CEO because we were handling, if I may say, the way the transition from Abertis to this new shareholder like Edizione Holding. Second important thing for me is that Edizione Holding has a very firm and strong commitment with the strategy and the equity story of growth of Cellnex. So this fits extremely, extremely very well for the execution of our strategy. And the third one is not just related with legal entities like Edizione Holding or Cellnex.  It's related with individuals. As you said before, we are talking about Marco Patuano as an individual. Marco Patuano is a very, very reputed and very experienced at senior management. He was CFO. He was CEO. He knows very well our industry. And therefore, the board -- but I have to -- I would like to understand myself. We have been very supportive on this appointment because taking into consideration these 3 main principles made a lot of sense to keep this governance that we had since our IPO, having a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and a CEO, because we and I understand that this is the best for the project. This is the best for the governance of the company, and this is the best for clarity in front of you, in front of the investors. And that's it, anything else behind of that. So I'm very happy. Personally speaking, I would like to tell you very, very -- in a transparent way, I'm very happy with that because, again, we really believe that this is the best for the company. This is the best for the future. Second question about the Dutch market, and maybe Alex could help me, but you know that our anchor customer today is KPN. We are following the evolution on the transition on the KPN management team. And you know that, well, T-Mobile and Tele2 are under a potential, let me put on that way, merge process. Therefore, I have to say, first of all, the Netherlands remains the strategy for us. And therefore, we are pursuing all the evolution, all the opportunities on the Netherlands. So it means that keep on our priorities, on our top priorities, but we have to find the right opportunity. I don't know. Alex, do you want to add something more?"

Let's say this merge process is freezing a little bit at our activity, especially with those 2 players.

So this is one of the first elements that we are intending to do on those countries where we have basic service. We are, let's say, expanding our portfolio with the rest of services we have. So this certification by the regional government for being Cellnex a Dutch supplier, we are out of the shelf, let's say, partner it is good outcome on this line. There was a third question. I can take it, Tobias if you want, on the JV. I think it is important, Emmett, to realize that many of those JVs are basically active sharing agreements, active equipment-sharing agreements with -- among MNOs. For instance, you mentioned infraco in France. So actually, in our portfolio of towers in France, we have infraco as a customer. Why? Because the 2 MNOs who are the members of that JV are having the ownership of the active equipment but not the passive infrastructure. So I would say, many -- probably most of these JVs around Europe are not taking into consideration the passive infrastructure, which is still remaining at each one MNO's balance sheet. So clearly, it's the first step for the MNOs on sharing. Clearly, also now we said we believe with the future 5G requirements and CapEx way, more sharing will come, and it is in the good direction in order, let's say, to put Cellnex value on the table."

In relation to the potential future topology that we could envisage for a telecom operator, I would not say only mobile network operator, a telecom operator with a converged network, what we will see is that besides the capillarity that our sites may provide they will need to communicate those towers with what they call metropolitan offices or central offices. Those are small data centers like mobile Edge computing would be the type of service that probably would be within a metropolitan office that will require the connectivity -- fiber connectivity from those small data centers to the final sites that today we are having. So the propositions that we believe we could do to our partners and even some of the propositions that we are having from some of our partners to analyze this, what and how we could be helpful on providing this connectivity and also on this type of small data centers. This is all this debate that some of the -- our peers in the U.S., as someone who mentioned before, Crown Castle, are already very much into. So the fact of charging, clearly, yes. So there is a CapEx being deployed. Always, there is a return in terms of a fee being captured by the customer. In relation to Switzerland, yes. We've shared, let's say, after the transaction with it,some of the uncertainties that were around in Switzerland. One of them was the radio spectrum limitations that at the time of the acquisition we were -- and some of you already asked about this potential limitation, and we always say this is twofold, no, because on one side the tenancy ratio maybe it's constrained a little bit. But then since you cannot put a lot of prediction on a single tower, you need more towers. So there is also pros and cons around that. In relation to that specific radiation limitation, the situation is that it has not changed. The regulation remains as it was and clearly is one of the elements that the MNOs, globally, in Switzerland are putting on the table on the discussions, and it is public on the future 5G options that are considering with the Swiss government or whether if this should be changed or not."

This is a service that -- your question, Fernando, was it would change the economics of broadcasting service this year? No. However, what we are doing with this service is providing the needed level of technical features that a linear platform like it is the terrestrial television [indiscernible] is not having. So the TV sets, as of today, are all connected TV sets, which potentially could have this sort of hybrid linear, nonlinear experience for the viewer. What we are doing is -- and free of charge, which is very important. What we are doing is putting together all the nonlinear content of the broadcasting TV stations on a single platform that you can navigate without any set-top box, just with a remote control and playing with the teletext buttons on the remote control, the red button kind of experience, and changing from linear to nonlinear. And we believe that this is a great achievement like other features, like 4k. We do also have 4k ultrahigh-definition transmissions in Spain in pilot mode. So all those elements, which other platforms may be having, we are always intending that also the DTT platform is having. So this means that the sustainability of the platform probably with these additional highly appreciated services may remain. So in the long term, probably the answer to your question, it is yes, that this will help digitally the sustainability of the platform."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. I will start underlining the main milestone of the period. Again, a quarter of solid execution both from operational and financial point of view. 
We continue to deliver on organic performance, posting solid organic growth, in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main value creation metric, growing at a robust 14%. 
We have adopted the new accounting standard, IFRS 16. This allows us to improve our leverage ratio, but please, bear in mind that there is no impact at cash flow level. The process of looking for new growth opportunities never stops. And as a result, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of a fiber optic network in Spain that will enhance our service offering for mobile operators. 
As we have insisted, we maintain the ambition to play a key role in the 5G value chain, and this new transaction fits perfectly well in this strategy and complements our current portfolio of services. 
We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, and we are closely working with key partners on an investor approach to execute value-accretive projects in 2018. 
We are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. And finally, I would stress that revenues and adjusted EBITDA grow at around 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. 
If we move to Slide #5. It's very well known to you and shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 to 2018. And as you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leveraged free cash flow have been growing at around 20% annually. And this growth is the reason behind these metrics doubling in size in 4 years. 
On Slide #6, you can graphically see the result of our growth strategy and our diversification efforts, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
We are today one of the main independent tower operators worldwide in number of sites, with presence in 6 countries and a portfolio that will consist of 28,000 sites, and the best is yet to come. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide financial details of the period."

Total PoPs have increased 23% in the period including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. We will focus on organic growth only. PoPs have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
Finally, DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe that the experience we are gathering in the area of DAS, small cells and identification solutions will translate into significant business in the future. 
On Slide 9, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have in place to secure future organic growth. 
In summary, we are levering on CommsCon credentials to deploy more projects in the area of DAS and small cells, car parks, football stadiums, transport networks. And we are doing all these in the current footprint, in the current 6 countries in which the company is present. 
Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy, in line with our expectations, and we believe that we can expand these very good relationships into new markets. 
We are providing a new hybrid TV platform for our national customers in Spain, therefore increasing the attractiveness of DTT. 
And finally, we are happy to confirm that the Spanish Ministry of Economy is planning to maintain the current number of DTT multiples in the context of the second digital dividend, in line also with our expectations. You will find all the initiatives that the company is pursuing in Slide 9 and that I find very interesting. 
So moving to Slide 10. You can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and savings [indiscernible] is reinforced by the contribution of our new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
The dark blue column on the right represents the positive impact of the adaptation of IFRS 16 and adjusted -- at adjusted EBITDA level, reaching EUR 291 million in the period. 
If we move to the next slide, I will provide more details on the impact from this accounting change. Please note that this accounting change is the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And Cellnex, what it's trying to do is to be a pioneer not only in our balance sheet impact but also on managing the impacts of IFRS 16 in our clients. This is key. We are learning, and we know how being innovative and at the same time following the rule, the accounting rule as it is defined, because we do think this is going to give us competitive advantage. 
Finally, just about IFRS 16. And before moving to Slide 11, let me remark that IFRS 16 will allow the comparability of Cellnex with other companies in the sector and at the same time with other companies in other sectors. We will see this on Slide 11, where you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow does not change at all. But above, you can see 2 effects: adjusted EBITDA increases because leases disappear from the OpEx line; and a new line below adjusted EBITDA, payment of lease liabilities, appears that offset this effect at cash level. And finally, our net debt increases as well as a result of the capitalization of the leases. This is all consistent with the company's view before the adoption of IFRS 16 already shared with the market in previous presentations. So at the end of the day, IFRS 16 allows Cellnex to be comparable with other peers that own more land than us, and this is crucial. Now we are comparable in terms of EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA margin and in terms of net debt EBITDA. 
Let me now move to our recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period on Slide 12. I would like to highlight that on the IFRS 16 our revenues rose 16% and our adjusted EBITDA by 20% and also that our EBITDA margin reaches 59%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to last year. 
I would like also -- moving now on the table. The contribution of telecom infrastructure service, coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%, already mentioned. 
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to management measures implemented. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes reflect our initiatives in place and the schedule of payments during the year. And as a result, we can present to you our growth of recurring levered free cash flow by 14% in the first 6 months of the year, which I do think is a very good news for our shareholders. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 13. It is important to highlight that the adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers because it equalized the treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases between or among different peers in towering. 
Cellnex area ratio reaches 4.8x, 4.8x net debt annualized EBITDA including the full year contribution of new transactions as well as the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, backlog of EUR 16 billion or, in other words, 20 years of revenues. 
Now moving to Slide 14. You can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile excluding the capitalization of leases [ we already ] explained earlier. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinance is expected before 2022, and our inflation-linked revenues plus our fixed-rate debt, more than 80%, provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increase and also provide us with a very flexible financing structure. 
So in summary, I would emphasize a strong position of our level liquidity, contracted revenues of EUR 16 billion, no short-term refinancing required, low maturities, highly attractive terms, no pledge, no hedge, no covenant, a compelling business risk profile and no financial constraints of any kind. 
All of these provide us with a wide array of funding alternatives, cash generated by current operations, [indiscernible] structure and salary [indiscernible], alternatives debt instruments, debt financing or equity partners [indiscernible] level among all others. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

But up to date, our expectation remains in the same trends that we did before. So Alex can you cover the others?"

Here there are basically 2 elements that we believe are, let's say, triggering that need. On one side, it is 5G deployment, which is something that will require the additional capacity that will be distributed from each one of our site will require better backhauling to the tower. That's one element. And the second is the topology of the site. So when we look at the topology of the site, probably the areas with more than, let's say, needs of coverage are requiring that, specifically, rooftops. As you know, we are active on rooftop deployment, especially on the [indiscernible] work in France, and this is potentially requiring fiber on the coming years when looking at the 5G needs. As of now, the level of fiber -- and I think your question was specifically in relation to Spain, we decided this is a recent acquisition that we are announcing, and there was some detail on Page 22. The fiber, which is not very high in terms of introduction on our side, belongs in those cases where exist to our clients. And we are having agreements on helping our clients to commercialize it, but it's not -- let me put it like that, yet our fiber. With this recent acquisition, we are starting to becoming more active on that field. We, as you will perceive also in some of the slides at the end of the presentation, we see this acquisition, as in the past it was CommsCon, that was the platform that was helping us to understand a new segment of products that potentially step by step could be deployed in other regions. And that's basically the rationale that it is behind this recent acquisition in the fiber domain."

The first one, just coming back to the fiber acquisition, and it's a clarification I suppose. The Crown Castle fiber strategy has been to buy dark fiber with the anticipation of deploying small cell networks on top of it. It doesn't sound like that is the strategy you will be pursuing because you can confirm that? And secondly, the multiple that you pay for that asset is obviously quite low. And that seems to be because Altice actually only has a concession to operate fiber. It doesn't actually own the fiber itself. Have you negotiated any option to buy the spectrum -- not the spectrum -- buy the fiber, the expiry of the current concession in 2031? And then finally -- we've now finally seen KKR take a major step forward in its European ambitions, finally pursuing an asset beyond Telxius. It will be interesting to hear your thoughts on how you would like to see market structure evolve in European towers over the medium and long term. And I suppose my question is would you prefer to be a potentially regulated monopoly or a lighter regulated oligopoly with a couple of comparably scaled peers? Hopefully that makes sense."

So you are correct. I think most of our sales of most of our peers when looking at the fiber we are approaching it from that strategic angle on how the additional capacity is going to be required and how we will deliver these backhauling to our site in the future. So clearly, the natural extension on our value chain, that comes immediately after the pure site co-location. This is the basic element. It has a second element which is for us quite important. When you have fiber, you are -- and sometimes, we even joke around that the fiber is like the root of a site. Why? Because it makes and sticks the tree, which is antenna, closer to the site and the commercialization capacity and the long-term partnership that you can establish with our clients is logically longer, and you have this additional step that it helps you to create this loyalty with your partner. So strategically wise, maybe it's not exactly the same as Crown Castle as you were potentially suggesting, but it's not differing very much. In that sense, we are looking for that fiber. But in some cases, we are finding as well that some of the clients are thinking on potentially having connectivity. And this is where we are also getting that know-how with that recent acquisition. Concerning that acquisition, you're right. The multiple being shown on Page 22 is an interesting one in comparison to other transactions. But you are right also pointing that there is a concession there, and this concession is ending on 2031. Potentially, the client we have there and the concessions there being public entity may require future deployments that will be a part of potential future discussions that we may have concerning the final date. But as of today, the final date is 2031, and this is being reflected on the multiple that we have paid."

We have to develop our value creation through the industrial skills. Third, we have a lot of experience on the -- in Europe on the operations. So this is a completely different value proposition, and this is the reason why Telxius or Altice doesn't fit with Cellnex strategy.

So I'm not surprised there. What's surprising is that your capitalization rate is 2.6x. The one that the agency used when they assessed your credit rating at 7.7, at least from Fitch. Now I believe that probably the credit agency didn't have all the information you provided to your own auditors. So my question is that, are you currently engaging with credit agencies on that? Do you reckon that could basically lead to reviewing about your gearings as they calculate themselves? And on that one, in the past you basically mentioned quite a few times the cap to your gearing at 6.5x, beyond which you don't want to use your balance sheet. Today, with the IFRS 16, you've gone from 5.5 to 4.8. So my question is that, is the 6.5 standing? Or are you going to review that one? The second one it's basically following on the previous answer. You basically mentioned about KKR having a quite different business model from yours. I would actually say it's very complementary to yours. They're looking for minority financial stakes. You're looking for control in industrial [ rationale ]. So my question is that, considering that at some stage you're going to exhaust your balance sheet room in terms of how much gearing you can put, what stopped you for actually partnering with KKR and, basically, pursue future transaction together? American Tower already do with PGGM in Europe. So I was just wondering how it would work with you and KKR or if you've already been talking to one another. And the very last one, it's on the provision. This quarter, you used significant portions of the EUR 55 million you provisioned last quarter.

Now regarding your 2 first questions are very -- both of them are very linked, now, because at the end of the day rating assessment and the net debt EBITDA somehow are linked. So let's go to IFRS 16 and rating assessment. So of course, I mean, we have a very open dialogue with the rating agencies, and we have been sharing with them all our work. And I think, and as all we know the Canadian system, initially this kind of changes seen in their methodologies it's nothing that can happen from one day to the other. This takes time. And also it takes time from us to explain the details, to explain the concepts. IFRS 16 is going to be something very important to the financial ecosystem, which is that the net debt EBITDA -- the EBITDA margins are going to be more comparable than before. And therefore, it is my feeling that adjustments that rating agencies tend to execute should be reviewed under the impact of IFRS 16. So if your question is yes or no, I would say to you my view is not yet. But I'm pretty sure that [ Ternsis ] is in a very well position to obtain a very good outcome of this discussion on a very good outcome of the implementation of IFRS 16. Please note that IFRS 16 as of June 2018 will be mandatory for all the companies. Therefore, it will be very difficult to track the information, will be very difficult to do adjustments for everyone. IFRS 16 has a lot of -- it's taking into account a lot of information from the companies, much more information that can be obtained from rating agencies and from any investor within the [indiscernible] accounts. So here, there are several details that will have to be assessed by rating agencies. By the way, one of them is -- has opened a paper, a discussion paper. And we are working the discussion paper, which is public, so that we can give our views and, obviously, to share the benefits of IFRS 16. You're talking about the 6.5x net debt EBITDA. Well, again, it's linked to the previous one. It's not white or black. It's just a question of explaining to the financial community that the standard for the net debt EBITDA are in the process of being changed. So as long as the different stakeholders understand these changes, as long as IFRS 16 is implemented, I do think that we've seen the same rating. We've seen the same parameters. We should have more leverage capacity. This is my view. But again, we early adopters. We are working in the very right direction. We have to go step by step. And as soon as we get more good outcome, we will share with you. But please, there are something very important here, Ottavio, we have to -- it's also about -- not it's -- our capacity of leverage is not only a ratio. It is our business risk profile. And as you can see, quarter after quarter, our business risk profile is improving. Our business risk profile is more diversified, and this is also very helpful. So it's not only IFRS 16. It's [ rather cost ] and business risk profile. So..."

And can you say are there any more targets out there you believe you can target in the Dutch towers market? And then lastly, just a big picture question. There's quite a few towers JVs in Europe. I'm thinking of infraco in France, the JV between Bouygues and SFR. There's also a couple of JVs here where I'm sitting in the U.K. And there's another big JV, of course, in Poland between Orange and T-Mobile. I guess these JVs look attractive to you because there's 2 tenants per tower. But on the other side, perhaps negotiating with 2 shareholders can be a little bit more complicated. Can you say a few words about where and what the potential is for Cellnex to maybe penetrate this JV market over time?"

Because when we talk about this type of issues, we have to talk about governance. First of all, I would like to underline that for me, personally speaking as the CEO of the company, I'm a firm believer of the 2 roles. I mean, in terms of governance, I like very much to keep the independency between the board and the executive directors and the executive senior team, and this is the reason why I am supportive of this structure in terms of governance. And I got to the Chairman of the Board and CEO because we were handling, if I may say, the way the transition from Abertis to this new shareholder like Edizione Holding. Second important thing for me is that Edizione Holding has a very firm and strong commitment with the strategy and the equity story of growth of Cellnex. So this fits extremely, extremely very well for the execution of our strategy. And the third one is not just related with legal entities like Edizione Holding or Cellnex. It's related with individuals. As you said before, we are talking about Marco Patuano as an individual. Marco Patuano is a very, very reputed and very experienced at senior management. He was CFO. He was CEO. He knows very well our industry. And therefore, the board -- but I have to -- I would like to understand myself. We have been very supportive on this appointment because taking into consideration these 3 main principles made a lot of sense to keep this governance that we had since our IPO, having a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and a CEO, because we and I understand that this is the best for the project. This is the best for the governance of the company, and this is the best for clarity in front of you, in front of the investors. And that's it, anything else behind of that. So I'm very happy. Personally speaking, I would like to tell you very, very -- in a transparent way, I'm very happy with that because, again, we really believe that this is the best for the company. This is the best for the future. Second question about the Dutch market, and maybe Alex could help me, but you know that our anchor customer today is KPN. We are following the evolution on the transition on the KPN management team. And you know that, well, T-Mobile and Tele2 are under a potential, let me put on that way, merge process. Therefore, I have to say, first of all, the Netherlands remains the strategy for us. And therefore, we are pursuing all the evolution, all the opportunities on the Netherlands. So it means that keep on our priorities, on our top priorities, but we have to find the right opportunity. I don't know. Alex, do you want to add something more?"

So this certification by the regional government for being Cellnex a Dutch supplier, we are out of the shelf, let's say, partner it is good outcome on this line. There was a third question. I can take it, Tobias if you want, on the JV. I think it is important, Emmett, to realize that many of those JVs are basically active sharing agreements, active equipment-sharing agreements with -- among MNOs. For instance, you mentioned infraco in France. So actually, in our portfolio of towers in France, we have infraco as a customer. Why? Because the 2 MNOs who are the members of that JV are having the ownership of the active equipment but not the passive infrastructure. So I would say, many -- probably most of these JVs around Europe are not taking into consideration the passive infrastructure, which is still remaining at each one MNO's balance sheet. So clearly, it's the first step for the MNOs on sharing. Clearly, also now we said we believe with the future 5G requirements and CapEx way, more sharing will come, and it is in the good direction in order, let's say, to put Cellnex value on the table."

In terms of -- I still didn't really understand what you see the main sort of use of it. Is it -- basically, are you more interested in local assets type fiber assets? Or is it more sort of backhaul to the tower I guess or more so you can connect small cells in more urban areas? And then do you think you can charge extra for connecting your sites to fiber? Or is it more a way to attract new tenants? And then secondly, I just want to follow up on your acquisitions in France and Switzerland. You've now had towers in these markets for a while. Can you maybe talk a little bit about things that sort of surprised you? I think in Switzerland it was a little bit unclear in terms of how many towers you could actually add new -- more tenants on given the electromagnetic emission regulation.

In relation to the potential future topology that we could envisage for a telecom operator, I would not say only mobile network operator, a telecom operator with a converged network, what we will see is that besides the capillarity that our sites may provide they will need to communicate those towers with what they call metropolitan offices or central offices. Those are small data centers like mobile Edge computing would be the type of service that probably would be within a metropolitan office that will require the connectivity -- fiber connectivity from those small data centers to the final sites that today we are having. So the propositions that we believe we could do to our partners and even some of the propositions that we are having from some of our partners to analyze this, what and how we could be helpful on providing this connectivity and also on this type of small data centers. This is all this debate that some of the -- our peers in the U.S., as someone who mentioned before, Crown Castle, are already very much into. So the fact of charging, clearly, yes. So there is a CapEx being deployed. Always, there is a return in terms of a fee being captured by the customer. In relation to Switzerland, yes. We've shared, let's say, after the transaction with it, some of the uncertainties that were around in Switzerland. One of them was the radio spectrum limitations that at the time of the acquisition we were -- and some of you already asked about this potential limitation, and we always say this is twofold, no, because on one side the tenancy ratio maybe it's constrained a little bit. But then since you cannot put a lot of prediction on a single tower, you need more towers. So there is also pros and cons around that. In relation to that specific radiation limitation, the situation is that it has not changed. The regulation remains as it was and clearly is one of the elements that the MNOs, globally, in Switzerland are putting on the table on the discussions, and it is public on the future 5G options that are considering with the Swiss government or whether if this should be changed or not."

No. However, what we are doing with this service is providing the needed level of technical features that a linear platform like it is the terrestrial television [indiscernible] is not having. So the TV sets, as of today, are all connected TV sets, which potentially could have this sort of hybrid linear, nonlinear experience for the viewer. What we are doing is -- and free of charge, which is very important. What we are doing is putting together all the nonlinear content of the broadcasting TV stations on a single platform that you can navigate without any set-top box, just with a remote control and playing with the teletext buttons on the remote control, the red button kind of experience, and changing from linear to nonlinear. And we believe that this is a great achievement like other features, like 4k. We do also have 4k ultrahigh-definition transmissions in Spain in pilot mode. So all those elements, which other platforms may be having, we are always intending that also the DTT platform is having. So this means that the sustainability of the platform probably with these additional highly appreciated services may remain.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. I will start underlining the main milestone of the period. Again, a quarter of solid execution both from operational and financial point of view. 
We continue to deliver on organic performance, posting solid organic growth, in line with our guidance. We continue to generate a strong recurring leverage free cash flow, our main value creation metric, growing at a robust 14%. 
We have adopted the new accounting standard, IFRS 16. This allows us to improve our leverage ratio, but please, bear in mind that there is no impact at cash flow level. The process of looking for new growth opportunities never stops. And as a result, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of a fiber optic network in Spain that will enhance our service offering for mobile operators. 
As we have insisted, we maintain the ambition to play a key role in the 5G value chain, and this new transaction fits perfectly well in this strategy and complements our current portfolio of services. 
We have a strong pipeline of proprietary deals, and we are closely working with key partners on an investor approach to execute value-accretive projects in 2018. 
We are reiterating our financial outlook for the year 2018. And finally, I would stress that revenues and adjusted EBITDA grow at around 15% and 20%, respectively, as a result of our focus on operational excellence. 
If we move to Slide #5. It's very well known to you and shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 to 2018. And as you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leveraged free cash flow have been growing at around 20% annually. And this growth is the reason behind these metrics doubling in size in 4 years. 
On Slide #6, you can graphically see the result of our growth strategy and our diversification efforts, with around 70% of our revenues to be generated by telecom infrastructure services and around 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain on a pro forma basis. 
We are today one of the main independent tower operators worldwide in number of sites, with presence in 6 countries and a portfolio that will consist of 28,000 sites, and the best is yet to come. 
I will now hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide financial details of the period."

Total PoPs have increased 23% in the period including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. We will focus on organic growth only. PoPs have increased 4%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. 
Finally, DAS nodes have increased 20% year-on-year, and we believe that the experience we are gathering in the area of DAS, small cells and identification solutions will translate into significant business in the future. 
On Slide 9, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have in place to secure future organic growth. 
In summary, we are levering on CommsCon credentials to deploy more projects in the area of DAS and small cells, car parks, football stadiums, transport networks. And we are doing all these in the current footprint, in the current 6 countries in which the company is present. 
Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy, in line with our expectations, and we believe that we can expand these very good relationships into new markets. 
We are providing a new hybrid TV platform for our national customers in Spain, therefore increasing the attractiveness of DTT. 
And finally, we are happy to confirm that the Spanish Ministry of Economy is planning to maintain the current number of DTT multiples in the context of the second digital dividend, in line also with our expectations. You will find all the initiatives that the company is pursuing in Slide 9 and that I find very interesting. 
So moving to Slide 10. You can see a graphical explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and savings [indiscernible] is reinforced by the contribution of our new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 20%. 
The dark blue column on the right represents the positive impact of the adaptation of IFRS 16 and adjusted -- at adjusted EBITDA level, reaching EUR 291 million in the period. 
If we move to the next slide, I will provide more details on the impact from this accounting change. Please note that this accounting change is the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And Cellnex, what it's trying to do is to be a pioneer not only in our balance sheet impact but also on managing the impacts of IFRS 16 in our clients. This is key. We are learning, and we know how being innovative and at the same time following the rule, the accounting rule as it is defined, because we do think this is going to give us competitive advantage. 
Finally, just about IFRS 16. And before moving to Slide 11, let me remark that IFRS 16 will allow the comparability of Cellnex with other companies in the sector and at the same time with other companies in other sectors. We will see this on Slide 11, where you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow does not change at all. But above, you can see 2 effects: adjusted EBITDA increases because leases disappear from the OpEx line; and a new line below adjusted EBITDA, payment of lease liabilities, appears that offset this effect at cash level. And finally, our net debt increases as well as a result of the capitalization of the leases. This is all consistent with the company's view before the adoption of IFRS 16 already shared with the market in previous presentations. So at the end of the day, IFRS 16 allows Cellnex to be comparable with other peers that own more land than us, and this is crucial. Now we are comparable in terms of EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA margin and in terms of net debt EBITDA. 
Let me now move to our recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period on Slide 12. I would like to highlight that on the IFRS 16 our revenues rose 16% and our adjusted EBITDA by 20% and also that our EBITDA margin reaches 59%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to last year. 
I would like also -- moving now on the table. The contribution of telecom infrastructure service, coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to adjusted EBITDA increase of 20%, already mentioned. 
Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to management measures implemented. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure, and taxes reflect our initiatives in place and the schedule of payments during the year. And as a result, we can present to you our growth of recurring levered free cash flow by 14% in the first 6 months of the year, which I do think is a very good news for our shareholders. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 13. It is important to highlight that the adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers because it equalized the treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases between or among different peers in towering. 
Cellnex area ratio reaches 4.8x, 4.8x net debt annualized EBITDA including the full year contribution of new transactions as well as the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and the associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.8 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, backlog of EUR 16 billion or, in other words, 20 years of revenues. 
Now moving to Slide 14. You can see here the details of our debt and our maturities profile excluding the capitalization of leases [ we already ] explained earlier. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinance is expected before 2022, and our inflation-linked revenues plus our fixed-rate debt, more than 80%, provide us with a strong protection against interest rate increase and also provide us with a very flexible financing structure. 
So in summary, I would emphasize a strong position of our level liquidity, contracted revenues of EUR 16 billion, no short-term refinancing required, low maturities, highly attractive terms, no pledge, no hedge, no covenant, a compelling business risk profile and no financial constraints of any kind. 
All of these provide us with a wide array of funding alternatives, cash generated by current operations, [indiscernible] structure and salary [indiscernible], alternatives debt instruments, debt financing or equity partners [indiscernible] level among all others. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

A competitor is flagging that they've seen a slowdown in business from Wind Tre. I was wondering if that's them focusing more on their own portfolio and the new build-to-suit plan that they have for themselves and maybe also a benefit from the Iliad rollout too? Can we expect ancillary EBITDA to potentially grow quicker than it did last year? And then finally, just a quick one on DAS.

But up to date, our expectation remains in the same trends that we did before. So Alex can you cover the others?"

Here there are basically 2 elements that we believe are, let's say, triggering that need. On one side, it is 5G deployment, which is something that will require the additional capacity that will be distributed from each one of our site will require better backhauling to the tower. That's one element. And the second is the topology of the site. So when we look at the topology of the site, probably the areas with more than, let's say, needs of coverage are requiring that, specifically, rooftops. As you know, we are active on rooftop deployment, especially on the [indiscernible] work in France, and this is potentially requiring fiber on the coming years when looking at the 5G needs. As of now, the level of fiber -- and I think your question was specifically in relation to Spain, we decided this is a recent acquisition that we are announcing, and there was some detail on Page 22. The fiber, which is not very high in terms of introduction on our side, belongs in those cases where exist to our clients. And we are having agreements on helping our clients to commercialize it, but it's not -- let me put it like that, yet our fiber. With this recent acquisition, we are starting to becoming more active on that field. We, as you will perceive also in some of the slides at the end of the presentation, we see this acquisition, as in the past it was CommsCon, that was the platform that was helping us to understand a new segment of products that potentially step by step could be deployed in other regions. And that's basically the rationale that it is behind this recent acquisition in the fiber domain."

The first one, just coming back to the fiber acquisition, and it's a clarification I suppose. The Crown Castle fiber strategy has been to buy dark fiber with the anticipation of deploying small cell networks on top of it. It doesn't sound like that is the strategy you will be pursuing because you can confirm that? And secondly, the multiple that you pay for that asset is obviously quite low. And that seems to be because Altice actually only has a concession to operate fiber. It doesn't actually own the fiber itself. Have you negotiated any option to buy the spectrum -- not the spectrum -- buy the fiber, the expiry of the current concession in 2031? And then finally -- we've now finally seen KKR take a major step forward in its European ambitions, finally pursuing an asset beyond Telxius. It will be interesting to hear your thoughts on how you would like to see market structure evolve in European towers over the medium and long term. And I suppose my question is would you prefer to be a potentially regulated monopoly or a lighter regulated oligopoly with a couple of comparably scaled peers? Hopefully that makes sense."

So you are correct. I think most of our sales of most of our peers when looking at the fiber we are approaching it from that strategic angle on how the additional capacity is going to be required and how we will deliver these backhauling to our site in the future. So clearly, the natural extension on our value chain, that comes immediately after the pure site co-location. This is the basic element. It has a second element which is for us quite important. When you have fiber, you are -- and sometimes, we even joke around that the fiber is like the root of a site. Why? Because it makes and sticks the tree, which is antenna, closer to the site and the commercialization capacity and the long-term partnership that you can establish with our clients is logically longer, and you have this additional step that it helps you to create this loyalty with your partner. So strategically wise, maybe it's not exactly the same as Crown Castle as you were potentially suggesting, but it's not differing very much. In that sense, we are looking for that fiber. But in some cases, we are finding as well that some of the clients are thinking on potentially having connectivity. And this is where we are also getting that know-how with that recent acquisition. Concerning that acquisition, you're right. The multiple being shown on Page 22 is an interesting one in comparison to other transactions. But you are right also pointing that there is a concession there, and this concession is ending on 2031. Potentially, the client we have there and the concessions there being public entity may require future deployments that will be a part of potential future discussions that we may have concerning the final date. But as of today, the final date is 2031, and this is being reflected on the multiple that we have paid."

We have to develop our value creation through the industrial skills. Third, we have a lot of experience on the -- in Europe on the operations. So this is a completely different value proposition, and this is the reason why Telxius or Altice doesn't fit with Cellnex strategy.

So I'm not surprised there. What's surprising is that your capitalization rate is 2.6x. The one that the agency used when they assessed your credit rating at 7.7, at least from Fitch. Now I believe that probably the credit agency didn't have all the information you provided to your own auditors. So my question is that, are you currently engaging with credit agencies on that? Do you reckon that could basically lead to reviewing about your gearings as they calculate themselves? And on that one, in the past you basically mentioned quite a few times the cap to your gearing at 6.5x, beyond which you don't want to use your balance sheet. Today, with the IFRS 16, you've gone from 5.5 to 4.8. So my question is that, is the 6.5 standing? Or are you going to review that one? The second one it's basically following on the previous answer. You basically mentioned about KKR having a quite different business model from yours. I would actually say it's very complementary to yours. They're looking for minority financial stakes. You're looking for control in industrial [ rationale ]. So my question is that, considering that at some stage you're going to exhaust your balance sheet room in terms of how much gearing you can put, what stopped you for actually partnering with KKR and, basically, pursue future transaction together? American Tower already do with PGGM in Europe. So I was just wondering how it would work with you and KKR or if you've already been talking to one another. And the very last one, it's on the provision. This quarter, you used significant portions of the EUR 55 million you provisioned last quarter.

Now regarding your 2 first questions are very -- both of them are very linked, now, because at the end of the day rating assessment and the net debt EBITDA somehow are linked. So let's go to IFRS 16 and rating assessment. So of course, I mean, we have a very open dialogue with the rating agencies, and we have been sharing with them all our work. And I think, and as all we know the Canadian system, initially this kind of changes seen in their methodologies it's nothing that can happen from one day to the other. This takes time. And also it takes time from us to explain the details, to explain the concepts. IFRS 16 is going to be something very important to the financial ecosystem, which is that the net debt EBITDA -- the EBITDA margins are going to be more comparable than before. And therefore, it is my feeling that adjustments that rating agencies tend to execute should be reviewed under the impact of IFRS 16. So if your question is yes or no, I would say to you my view is not yet. But I'm pretty sure that [ Ternsis ] is in a very well position to obtain a very good outcome of this discussion on a very good outcome of the implementation of IFRS 16. Please note that IFRS 16 as of June 2018 will be mandatory for all the companies. Therefore, it will be very difficult to track the information, will be very difficult to do adjustments for everyone. IFRS 16 has a lot of -- it's taking into account a lot of information from the companies, much more information that can be obtained from rating agencies and from any investor within the [indiscernible] accounts. So here, there are several details that will have to be assessed by rating agencies. By the way, one of them is -- has opened a paper, a discussion paper. And we are working the discussion paper, which is public, so that we can give our views and, obviously, to share the benefits of IFRS 16. You're talking about the 6.5x net debt EBITDA. Well, again, it's linked to the previous one. It's not white or black. It's just a question of explaining to the financial community that the standard for the net debt EBITDA are in the process of being changed. So as long as the different stakeholders understand these changes, as long as IFRS 16 is implemented, I do think that we've seen the same rating. We've seen the same parameters. We should have more leverage capacity. This is my view. But again, we early adopters. We are working in the very right direction. We have to go step by step. And as soon as we get more good outcome, we will share with you. But please, there are something very important here, Ottavio, we have to -- it's also about -- not it's -- our capacity of leverage is not only a ratio. It is our business risk profile. And as you can see, quarter after quarter, our business risk profile is improving. Our business risk profile is more diversified, and this is also very helpful. So it's not only IFRS 16. It's [ rather cost ] and business risk profile. So..."

And can you say are there any more targets out there you believe you can target in the Dutch towers market? And then lastly, just a big picture question. There's quite a few towers JVs in Europe. I'm thinking of infraco in France, the JV between Bouygues and SFR. There's also a couple of JVs here where I'm sitting in the U.K. And there's another big JV, of course, in Poland between Orange and T-Mobile. I guess these JVs look attractive to you because there's 2 tenants per tower. But on the other side, perhaps negotiating with 2 shareholders can be a little bit more complicated. Can you say a few words about where and what the potential is for Cellnex to maybe penetrate this JV market over time?"

Because when we talk about this type of issues, we have to talk about governance. First of all, I would like to underline that for me, personally speaking as the CEO of the company, I'm a firm believer of the 2 roles. I mean, in terms of governance, I like very much to keep the independency between the board and the executive directors and the executive senior team, and this is the reason why I am supportive of this structure in terms of governance. And I got to the Chairman of the Board and CEO because we were handling, if I may say, the way the transition from Abertis to this new shareholder like Edizione Holding. Second important thing for me is that Edizione Holding has a very firm and strong commitment with the strategy and the equity story of growth of Cellnex. So this fits extremely, extremely very well for the execution of our strategy. And the third one is not just related with legal entities like Edizione Holding or Cellnex. It's related with individuals. As you said before, we are talking about Marco Patuano as an individual. Marco Patuano is a very, very reputed and very experienced at senior management. He was CFO. He was CEO. He knows very well our industry. And therefore, the board -- but I have to -- I would like to understand myself. We have been very supportive on this appointment because taking into consideration these 3 main principles made a lot of sense to keep this governance that we had since our IPO, having a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and a CEO, because we and I understand that this is the best for the project. This is the best for the governance of the company, and this is the best for clarity in front of you, in front of the investors. And that's it, anything else behind of that. So I'm very happy. Personally speaking, I would like to tell you very, very -- in a transparent way, I'm very happy with that because, again, we really believe that this is the best for the company. This is the best for the future. Second question about the Dutch market, and maybe Alex could help me, but you know that our anchor customer today is KPN. We are following the evolution on the transition on the KPN management team. And you know that, well, T-Mobile and Tele2 are under a potential, let me put on that way, merge process. Therefore, I have to say, first of all, the Netherlands remains the strategy for us. And therefore, we are pursuing all the evolution, all the opportunities on the Netherlands. So it means that keep on our priorities, on our top priorities, but we have to find the right opportunity. I don't know. Alex, do you want to add something more?"

Let's say this merge process is freezing a little bit at our activity, especially with those 2 players. However, as we, let's say, briefly mentioned on Page 9, we've been certified by the regional government for being a certified Dutch supplier. So this is one of the first elements that we are intending to do on those countries where we have basic service. We are, let's say, expanding our portfolio with the rest of services we have. So this certification by the regional government for being Cellnex a Dutch supplier, we are out of the shelf, let's say, partner it is good outcome on this line. There was a third question. I can take it, Tobias if you want, on the JV. I think it is important, Emmett, to realize that many of those JVs are basically active sharing agreements, active equipment-sharing agreements with -- among MNOs. For instance, you mentioned infraco in France. So actually, in our portfolio of towers in France, we have infraco as a customer. Why? Because the 2 MNOs who are the members of that JV are having the ownership of the active equipment but not the passive infrastructure. So I would say, many -- probably most of these JVs around Europe are not taking into consideration the passive infrastructure, which is still remaining at each one MNO's balance sheet. So clearly, it's the first step for the MNOs on sharing. Clearly, also now we said we believe with the future 5G requirements and CapEx way, more sharing will come, and it is in the good direction in order, let's say, to put Cellnex value on the table."

And then on the PoPs in Italy, is it right to think that Iliad is now -- will start adding around 100 PoPs every quarter? Will we start to see a sort of reliable Iliad that get coming in?

It's very difficult for us to provide you with a guidance on revenue per project. Spain, Italy, the answer is, it's actually a combination of very small acquisitions and then some build to suit. So I would say it's going to be in both cases 60% small acquisitions and the remaining 40% new build. And last question on Iliad. It is fantastic news that we are seeing some activity coming -- already coming from -- integrated from them. But having said that, we're going to extrapolate this quarter on the remaining part of the year. As you already know, under the single agreement we have signed with them, there is no complement on volumes. There's no exclusivity.

Or is it more a way to attract new tenants? And then secondly, I just want to follow up on your acquisitions in France and Switzerland. You've now had towers in these markets for a while. Can you maybe talk a little bit about things that sort of surprised you?

In relation to the potential future topology that we could envisage for a telecom operator, I would not say only mobile network operator, a telecom operator with a converged network, what we will see is that besides the capillarity that our sites may provide they will need to communicate those towers with what they call metropolitan offices or central offices. Those are small data centers like mobile Edge computing would be the type of service that probably would be within a metropolitan office that will require the connectivity -- fiber connectivity from those small data centers to the final sites that today we are having. So the propositions that we believe we could do to our partners and even some of the propositions that we are having from some of our partners to analyze this, what and how we could be helpful on providing this connectivity and also on this type of small data centers. This is all this debate that some of the -- our peers in the U.S., as someone who mentioned before, Crown Castle, are already very much into. So the fact of charging, clearly, yes. So there is a CapEx being deployed. Always, there is a return in terms of a fee being captured by the customer. In relation to Switzerland, yes. We've shared, let's say, after the transaction with it, some of the uncertainties that were around in Switzerland. One of them was the radio spectrum limitations that at the time of the acquisition we were -- and some of you already asked about this potential limitation, and we always say this is twofold, no, because on one side the tenancy ratio maybe it's constrained a little bit. But then since you cannot put a lot of prediction on a single tower, you need more towers. So there is also pros and cons around that. In relation to that specific radiation limitation, the situation is that it has not changed. The regulation remains as it was and clearly is one of the elements that the MNOs, globally, in Switzerland are putting on the table on the discussions, and it is public on the future 5G options that are considering with the Swiss government or whether if this should be changed or not."

No. However, what we are doing with this service is providing the needed level of technical features that a linear platform like it is the terrestrial television [indiscernible] is not having. So the TV sets, as of today, are all connected TV sets, which potentially could have this sort of hybrid linear, nonlinear experience for the viewer. What we are doing is -- and free of charge, which is very important. What we are doing is putting together all the nonlinear content of the broadcasting TV stations on a single platform that you can navigate without any set-top box, just with a remote control and playing with the teletext buttons on the remote control, the red button kind of experience, and changing from linear to nonlinear. And we believe that this is a great achievement like other features, like 4k. We do also have 4k ultrahigh-definition transmissions in Spain in pilot mode. So all those elements, which other platforms may be having, we are always intending that also the DTT platform is having. So this means that the sustainability of the platform probably with these additional highly appreciated services may remain.

I would like to start underlying the main milestones of the period. Again, a quarter of solid execution both operationally and financially. As you can see, we are continuing to generate strong financial figures as a result of our organic growth. Our focus on cost control and operational excellence and the contribution from assets. Revenues grew 15% our adjusted EBITDA around 20% and our liquidity and leveraged free cash flow are almost 11%. We continue to deliver on organic performance posting a solid growth in line with our medium-term guidance. I would also like to emphasize that Iliad continues to generate a steady flow of co-location's in Italy and that we are now hosting new clients in France and Switzerland. We are out always working in order to find new sources of organic growth. We are strengthening our relationship with Iliad both in Italy and France. We are seeing further demand for our portfolio outside of France and Switzerland and we are pursuing several indoor coverage project across Europe and assessing opportunities in order to play a key role in the 5G value chains and become a long-term industrial partner for the European operations. We are iterating our 2018 financial outlook, aiming at the top end of full year range, maintaining our financial discipline is key and we have demonstrated our ability to talk -- to walk away from processes where our value creation criteria could not be met. And finally, I would like to reiterate that Cellnex is assessing a number of proprietary bills closely working with key European partners with an investor approach with the objective to reach value additive agreements.
And now I will handover to our CFO, José Manuel Aisa, who will provide more details of the periods."

If we go to Slide 5 it shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 through 2018. As you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow are growing 20% annually. Our growth that's has a low metrics to double in just 4 years. Moving to Slide 6, total PoPs have increased 12% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs has increased 4.5% about our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. This is mainly due to the continued justification trend in Europe and the contribution from Iliad in Italy. DAS nodes have increased by 30% and we believe the strong we are building in these areas of DAS, Small Cells and the European solutions will translate into significant opportunities in the future.
On Slide 7, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have on the table right now in order to secure further organic growth. In summary, Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy and France and we believe that there is room to continue strengthening these very good relationships. We are seeing further demand of our for our portfolio of sites in France and Switzerland with initial colocations from SwissCon and Salt are already in place. And finally, we are levering on CommsCon to deploy more projects in the area of indoor coverage across Europe.
Moving to Slide 8. You can see here the building blocks of our yesterday's day-to-day performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA in the period of 20%. The dark blue column on the right-hand side represents the positive impact at adjusted EBITDA level of adopting IFRS 16 reaching for EUR 139 million in the period.
I will now move to our recurring lever free cash flow generation in the period of -- in the period on Slide 9. I would like to highlight that our revenues grew 15% and that on the IFRS 16 our adjusted EBITDA grows 19% and our EBITDA margin reaches 68%. A significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to the same period last year.
Moving out to the table the contribution from telecom infrastructure service coupled with a very well-managed cost base leads to the 90% adjusted EBITDA growth we mentioned. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive using implementation of management measures. Interspace say our coupons as scheduled and that's our initiatives in place and payments during the fiscal year.
Moving out to our balance sheet on Slide 10. It is important to reminder that adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers as it equalizes treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases. Our leverage writeup reaches 4.9x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from IFRS 16 as well as the full year contribution of new deals. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases and their IFRS 16. Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.7 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues a potload of EUR 16 billion equivalent to 20 years of revenues. In Slide 11, you can see here the details of our debt structure and maturities per file, excluding the capitalization of lease liabilities. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years no material refinancing is expected before 2022 and our inflation link revenues and that are positive impact from rising inflation. So in summary, we have a strong available liquidity on attractive revenues, low maturity, very attractive cost of debt, a compelling business risk profile and no financing constraints. All this provide us with a wide array of options and flexibility to continue funding our growth strategy.
Finally, a few words on our guidance in Slide 12. We are iterating our 2018 financial outlook, narrowing our estimate and aiming at the very top end of our full year rate. As how we say in Cellnex, we will lead the good for the very end. So we feel very positive about the performance of the company. This has been a very good year and we hope to close this full year 2018 very successfully. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

Amendments is a big feature in the state but it's been less prominent in your story so far and it would be interesting to hear if the 5G spectrum wave could change that. And finally, quite a high-level question. As you executed on your strategy over the past years you began to build scale and presence in quite a large number of areas outside MACRA Towers so it would be useful to understand that as you look at the diverse array of investments opportunities you have ahead of you, be it small cells, or fiber or data centers and of course, MACRA Towers, how do you prioritize each area? Is it still purely IRR or NPV? Or is there a particular area that has strategic value higher than the others?"

So, we have also to understand that mobile edge computer -- edge computing should be amassed where we talk about industrial 5G services. I mean when the latency requires less than 5 milliseconds latency. So this is not for the first day of 5G. This would be let me say a second wave of requirements from of the 5G network. So our focus today is to expand the intensification and maybe to work on the transmission before on the edge computing. Those are our priorities. And maybe if I can replay the first question about the assessment -- the new assessment of the transmission of the television, we do not expect relevant changes on this revelation.

So as you know, this is also a bunch of different activities so it's not only just one. So depending on how each of them perform on a consolidated basis so to say, we can find different performances every quarter. Finally, just to clarify that in Spain, we don't only report our operating activity but also we have the cost of the quarter. So if we hire senior staff and also if every single effort we make in terms of site management or base corporate services, these costs are included here. So that this might be distorting the EBITDA performance despite as you mentioned the very good organic growth."

The first one it's straightforward on the provision for the workforce reduction rebooked early this year. If you can just how much of this has been used and as we already are generating the cost settings for you. The second is on the DAS. We had a number of quarters in the years with a lot of KPIs on the growth and I was wondering if you can start giving me some financials. What's the contribution you get from DAS and revenues and what sort of growth you're achieving on that segment? The third, it's a bit more open. It's on the M&A. There was a very brief comment in the start of the call reiterating that you will be very opportunistic. On page 14 in the appendix you show a chart whereby you basically highlight your ambitions so following your peers in the U.S. Now if somebody pulled the chart it says that the U.S. has flattened in terms of growth on their portfolio for exactly from the year where you are at the moment until year 8, so exactly they take a pause of 4 years before they start to acquire new towers. Now given your balance sheet at the moment, somebody would wonder that potentially could happen to you because exactly there's not a lot of room today to do big acquisitions. So the question I'd ask is first of all, is that particular path you envisage to follow? And remain in the same topic, we bombarded on our side about operator that now they're very keen on monetizing their portfolio. We heard Deutsche for a number of quarters if not years potentially we need to do with the rest of the towers[indiscernible] next week but it looks like that they already did a tender for an outsourcing of 50 share towers whereby also your name was put on the frame. So I know that you can not comment in terms of you talking to on a sort of let's put that way agreements you can engage but could you please tell us a bit of an idea about first of all, your approach is to complete your footprint where you are or potential to continue markets. If so, which of the markets you basically set markets a few quarters ago. If I say market sale that's the market I feel you will be targeting. And second 1 it's the in terms of the balance sheet with the average 16 you had a benefit to your gearing. Still, we're talking about potential capping at 6x net debt to EBITDA or something will change?"

So what we like to give you here is what has happened and what could happen to us by eventually it wouldn't have happened in the same way. So we just aspirational. So do not track it every year. The following point is, it is true, 3 years ago and all of you that are asking today have always been with us and you have followed our equity study at the very beginning to explain that tower in Europe made sense was difficult. Was difficult. Because may be some and may not be worth thinking of that. As of today, you are suggesting several names that seems to be thinking about. And this is a key point. The business model works. There is value. There is value to respect. And I can tell you that we are working in this business model and in detail with ideas. One of the ideas that you are suggesting is about IFRS 16 and impact on the balance sheet. You know, Ottavio that IFRS 16 is one of the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And we are very well prepared to face these new M&A pipeline not only from an industrial perspective, which I think is key but also from an accountancy perspective. When you talk about net debt EBITDA, when you raise your points about the balance sheet, obviously, the impact of IFRS 16 is going to be important in the balance sheet of all the companies, M&Rs, towering companies, retailers, everyone. So it's important to help ourselves, our clients and the community to explain that the metrics are going to change. So we are involved in this task not only for ourselves but also for our clients and obviously talking to different stakeholders regarding credit banks, agencies, bondholders, this is going to have an impact on the net debt EBITDA for sure. How much? That me let tell you that IFRS 16 has not been yet implemented. Mandatorily speaking in Europe this will start in January when 2019. At the moment we will see the results and I can tell you that we will be ready to have a new view on balance sheet evolution. But many times we think or we feel that the stakeholders have not adapted yet. That's the reason we'd present to you the numbers that came to account year '17 and IFRS 16. Okay? So, it's a process. We are leader in this process and we are happy."

If we go to Slide 5 it shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 through 2018. As you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring levered free cash flow have grown 20% annually, a growth that has allowed these metrics to double in just 4 years. Moving to Slide 6, total PoPs have increased 12% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4.5%, above our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. This is mainly due to the continued densification trend in Europe and the contribution from Iliad in Italy. Annually DAS nodes have increased by 20% and we believe that the strong [ preventions ] we are building in these areas of DAS, Small Cells and indoor coverage solutions will translate into significant opportunities in the future.
On Slide 7, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have on the table right now in order to secure further organic growth. In summary, Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy and France and we believe that there is room to continue strengthening this very good relationship. We are seeing further demand of our -- for our portfolio of sites in France and Switzerland with initial colocations from SwissCom and Salt already in place. And finally, we are levering on CommsCon [ preventions ] to deploy more projects in the area of indoor coverage across Europe.
Moving to Slide 8. You can see here the building blocks of our year's to date day-to-day performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA in the period of 20%. The dark blue column on the right-hand side represents the positive impact at adjusted EBITDA level of adopting IFRS 16 reaching EUR 439 million in the period.
I will now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period of -- in the period on Slide 9. I would like to highlight that our revenues grew 15% and that on the IFRS 16 our adjusted EBITDA grows 19% and our EBITDA margin reaches 68%. A significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to the same period last year.
Moving now to the table, the contribution from telecom infrastructure service coupled with a very well-managed cost base leads to the 90% adjusted EBITDA growth already mentioned. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive utilizing the implementation of management measures. Interstate we pay our coupons as scheduled and [ tax our initiatives ] in place and payments during the fiscal year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 10. It is important to remind that adoption of IFRS 16 provides a better comparability with peers as it equalizes treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases. Our leverage ratio reaches 4.9x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from IFRS 16 as well as the full year contribution of new deals. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS 16. Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.7 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, a padlock of EUR 15 billion equivalent to 20 years of revenues. In Slide 11, you can see here the details of our debt structure and maturities profile, excluding the capitalization of lease liabilities. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years, no material refinancing is expected before 2022 and our inflation linked revenues from [ fisury ] debt allow us to expect positive impact from rising inflation. So in summary, we have a strong available liquidity on attractive revenues, low maturity, very attractive cost of debt, a compelling business risk profile and no financing constraints. All this provide us with a wide array of options and flexibility to continue funding our growth strategy.
Finally, a few words on our guidance in Slide 12. We are reiterating our 2018 financial outlook, narrowing our estimate and aiming at the very top end of our full year range. As how we say in Cellnex, we will leave the good for the very end. So we feel very positive about the performance of the company. This has been a very good year and we hope to close this full year 2018 very successfully. And with this, we are now available to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line."

I think the first one that you have mentioned there is it possible to get sort of an idea how many that is and which operators if possible? And lastly just on your recurring or free cash.

Regarding your final question, what is the recurring cash flow working capital we have always been very clear here that we do think that for the full year, working capital should tend to neutral.

So more or less we think can be -- my feeling will be positive so we will end up with a positive working capital but not a big number. Maybe 5 is fine. I don't know. We have not been able to estimate this but in showing us up at a good momentum.

We are basically building our portfolio offsite by acquisition and by construction of new sites in France called Bouygues Telecom, also we have Switzerland, which is a portfolio site we have bought from Sunrise a few months ago so we have already established our base there.

The first one it's straightforward, is on the provision for the workforce reduction you booked early this year. If you can just tell us how much of this has been used and is it already generating the cost savings for you. The second is on the DAS. We had a number of quarters in the years with a lot of KPIs on the growth and I was wondering if you can start giving me some financials. What's the contribution you get from DAS in revenues and what sort of growth you're achieving on that segment? The third, it's a bit more open. It's on the M&A. There was a very brief comment in the start of the call reiterating that you will be very opportunistic. On page 14 in the appendix you show a chart whereby you basically highlight your ambitions of following your peers in the U.S. Now if somebody followed that chart it says that the U.S. has flattened in terms of growth on their portfolio for exactly from the year where you are at the moment until year 8, so effectively they take a pause of 4 years before they start to build -- acquire new towers. Now given your balance sheet at the moment, somebody would wonder that potentially could happen to you because in fact there's not a lot of room today to do big acquisitions. So that's the question I'd ask is first of all, is that particular path one that you envisage to follow? And remain on the same topic, we're bombarded on our side about operator that now they're very keen on monetizing their portfolio. We heard Deutsche for a number of quarters if not years potentially waiting to do with the rest of the towers, Vodaphone is going to announce something next week but it looks that they already did a tender for an outsourcing of 50 share towers whereby also your name was put on the frame. So I know that you can not comment in terms of you're talking to on a sort of let's put that way agreements you can engage but could you tell us a bit of an idea about first of all, are your approach is to complete your footprint where you are or potentially to enter new markets? If so, which of the markets are -- you basically set the markets a few quarters ago. If those same markets still the markets you will be targeting? And second 1 it's the in terms of the, your balance sheet with the IFRS 16 you had a benefit to your gearing. Are still we talking about potential capping at 6x net debt to EBITDA or something will change?"

It's not a tracking or imitation model. It's aspirational model. So I don't know if we will buy 1 tower tomorrow or not. So what we try to give you here is what has happened and what could happen to us, but eventually it would not happen in the same way. So it's just aspirational. So do not track it every year. The following point is, it is true, 3 years ago and all of you that are asking today, you have always been with us and you have followed our equity study at the very beginning to explain that tower in Europe made sense was difficult. Was difficult. Because maybe some may not be worth thinking of that. As of today, you are suggesting several names that seems to be thinking about. And this is a key point. The business model works. There is value. There is value to this fact. And I can tell you that we are working in this business model and in detail with ideas. One of the ideas that you are suggesting is about IFRS 16 and impact on the balance sheet. You know, Ottavio, that IFRS 16 is one of the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And we are very well prepared to face this new M&A pipeline not only from an industrial perspective, which I think is key but also from an accountancy perspective. When you talk about net debt to EBITDA, when you raise your points about the balance sheet, obviously, the impact of IFRS 16 is going to be important in the balance sheet of all the companies, M&Rs, towering companies, retailers, everyone. So it's important to help ourselves, our clients and the community to explain that the metrics are going to change. So we are involved in this task not only for ourselves but also for our clients and obviously talking to different stakeholders regarding credit: banks, rating agencies, bondholders, this is going to have an impact on the net debt EBITDA for sure. How much? Yet me let tell you that IFRS 16 has not been yet implemented. Mandatorily speaking in Europe this will start in January 1, 2019. At the moment we will see the results and I can tell you that we will be ready to have a new view on balance sheet evolution. But many times we think or we feel that the stakeholders have not adopted yet. That's the reason we'd present to you the numbers taking into account year '17 and IFRS 16. Okay? So, it's a process. We are leader in this process and we are quite happy."

Moving to Slide 6, total PoPs have increased 12% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4.5%, above our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. This is mainly due to the continued densification trend in Europe and the contribution from Iliad in Italy. Finally, DAS nodes have increased by 20%, and we believe that the strong credentials we are building in these areas of DAS, Small Cells and mitigation solutions will translate into significant opportunities in the future.
On Slide 7, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have on the table right now in order to secure further organic growth. In summary, Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy and France, and we believe that there is room to continue strengthening this very good relationship. We are seeing further demand of our -- for our portfolio of sites in France and Switzerland with initial colocations from Swisscom and Salt already in place. And finally, we are levering on CommsCon prevention as to deploy more projects in the area of indoor coverage across Europe.
Moving to Slide 8. You can see here the building blocks of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA in the period of 20%. The dark blue column on the right-hand side represents the positive impact at adjusted EBITDA level of adopting IFRS16 reaching EUR 439 million in the period.
I will now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period of -- in the period on Slide 9. I would like to highlight that our revenues grew 15% and that under IFRS16 our adjusted EBITDA grows 19% and our EBITDA margin reaches 68%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to the same period last year.
Moving now to the table. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Service coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to the 90% adjusted EBITDA growth already mentioned. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to implementation of management measures. Interest pay we pay our coupons as scheduled and tax, our initiatives in place on payments during the fiscal year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 10. It is important to remind that adoption of IFRS16 provides a better comparability with peers as it equalizes treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases. Our leverage ratio reaches 4.9x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from IFRS16 as well as the full year contribution of new deals. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS16. Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.7 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, a backlog of EUR 16 billion equivalent to 20 years of revenues. 
In Slide 11, you can see here the details of our debt structure and maturities profile, excluding the capitalization of lease liabilities. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022, and our inflation-linked revenues and fixed-rate debt allow us to expect positive impact from rising inflation. 
So in summary, we have a strong available liquidity, contracted revenues, long maturity, a very attractive cost of debt, a compelling business risk profile and no financing constraints. All this provide us with a wide array of options and flexibility to continue funding our growth strategy.
Finally, a few words on our guidance on Slide 12. We are reiterating our 2018 financial outlook, narrowing our estimate and aiming at the very top end of our full year range. As is always in Cellnex, we will leave the good for the very end. So we feel very positive about the performance of the company. This has been a very good year, and we hope to close this full year 2018 very successfully. 
And with this, we are now available to answer any question you may have. So let's please open the line."

Amendments is a big feature in the States but it's been less prominent in your story so far, and it would be interesting to hear if the 5G spectrum wave could change that. And then finally, quite a high-level question, but as you've executed on your strategy over the past few years, you've begun to build scale and presence in quite a large number of areas outside macro towers. So it would be useful to understand that as you look at the diverse array of investment opportunities you have ahead of you, be it small cells, or fiber, or data centers and of course, macro towers, how do you prioritize each area? Is it still purely IRR or NPV? Or is there a particular area that has strategic value higher than the others?"

I mean, this is the part of the supply chain where we are quite far away, at least in Europe. I mean this is not a technical issue. I am talking about business model, different type of roles, et cetera. So we have also to understand that mobile edge computer -- edge computing should be amassed where we talk about industrial 5G services. I mean, when the latency requires less than 5 milliseconds latency. So this is not for the first day of 5G. This would be, let me say, a second wave of requirements from the 5G network. So our focus today is to expand the densification and maybe to work on the transmission before on the edge computing. Those are our priorities. 
And maybe if I can replay the first question about the assessment -- the new assessment of the transmission of the terrestrial television, we do not expect relevant changes on this regulation. This regulation is just to provide access to our infrastructures for the wholesalers, so all in all, we do not expect major changes."

And then back to your first question, I remind that you that basically rest of Europe for us is mostly France, and we are in the integration mode. We are basically building our portfolio of sites by acquisition and by construction of new sites in France, called Bouygues Telecom. Also, we have Switzerland, which is a portfolio of sites we have bought from Sunrise a few months ago, so we have already established our base there. And then we have also a presence in the U.K. and Netherlands with organic growth rates. That not changing.

We have seen the quarters with the performance, also very good ones. So I think that is going to be the typical quarter-on-quarter performance of this activity going forward. So as you know, this is also the -- a bunch of different sub-activities so it's not only just one. So depending on how each of them perform on a consolidated basis, so to say, we can find different performances every quarter. 
Finally, just to clarify that in Spain, we don't only report our operating activity. But also we have the cost of headquarters. So I mean then, if we hire senior staff and also if every single effort we make in terms of site management or these corporate services, these costs are included here. So that this might be maybe distorting the EBITDA performance despite, as you mentioned, this very good organic growth."

The first one, it's straightforward, is on the provision for the workforce reduction you booked early this year. If you can just tell us how much of this has been used? And is it already generating cost savings for you? The second is on the DAS. We had a number of quarters or years with a lot of KPIs on the growth. I was wondering if you can start giving some financials. What's the contribution you get from DAS in revenues? And what sort of growth you're achieving on that segment? The third, it's a bit more open. It's on the M&A on -- there was a very brief comment in the start of the call reiterating that you will be very opportunistic. On Page 14, in the appendix, you show a chart whereby you basically highlight your ambitions of following your peers in the U.S. Now if somebody followed that chart, it says that the U.S. has flattened in terms of growth on their portfolio for exactly from the year where you are at the moment until year 8. So effectively they take a pause of 4 years before they start to build -- acquire new towers. Now given your balance sheet at the moment, somebody would wonder that potentially could happen to you because the fact there's not a lot of room today to do big acquisitions. So that's the question I'd ask is first of all, if that particular path something that you envisage to follow? And remain on the same topic, we're bombarded on our side about operator, that now they're very keen on monetizing their portfolio. We heard Deutsche for a number of quarters, if not years, potentially waiting to do with the rest of the towers. Vodafone is going to announce something next week, but it looks that they already did a tender for an outsourcing of 50 shared towers, whereby also your name was put on the frame. So I know that you cannot comment in terms of you're talking to and you're sort of, let's put that way, agreements you can engage, but could you tell us a bit of an idea about, first of all, are your approach is to complete your footprint where you are or potentially to enter new markets? If so, which of the markets are -- you basically set markets a few quarters ago. If those same markets still the one that you will be targeting? And second one, it's the -- in terms of the -- your balance sheet. With the IFRS16 you had a benefit to your gearing. Still, we're talking about potential capping at 6x net debt to EBITDA or something will change."

Well, this is an aspiration. It's not tracking or imitation model. It's aspirational model. So I don't know if I -- we will buy one tower tomorrow or not. So what we try to give you here is what has happened and what could happen to us, but eventually it would not happen in the same way. So it's just aspirational. So do not track it every year. 
The following point is, it is true, 3 years ago and you -- all of you that are asking today, you have always been with us, and you have followed our equity study at the very beginning to explain that tower in Europe made sense, was difficult, was difficult. Because maybe some may not worth thinking of that. As of today, you are suggesting several names that seems to be thinking about. And this is a key point. The business model works. There is value. There is value to start. And I can tell you that we are working in this business model and in detail with ideas. 
Now one of the ideas that you are suggesting is about IFRS16 and impact on the balance sheet. You know, Ottavio, that IFRS16 is one of the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And we are very well prepared to face this new M&A pipeline, not only from an industrial perspective, which I think is key, but also from an accountancy perspective. When you talk about net debt EBITDA, when you raise your points about the balance sheet, obviously, the impact of IFRS16 is going to be important in the balance sheet of all the companies: MNOs, towering companies, retailers, everyone. So it's important to help ourselves, our clients and the community to explain that the metrics are going to change. So we are involved in this task, not only for us, but also for our clients and obviously talking to different stakeholders regarding credit: banks, rating agencies, bondholders. This is going to have an impact on the net debt EBITDA for sure. How much? Yet me let tell you that IFRS16 has not been yet implemented. Mandatorily speaking in Europe, this will start in January 1, 2019. At the moment we will see the results, and I can tell you that we will be ready to have a new view on balance sheet evolution. But many times, we think or we feel that the stakeholders have not adapted yet. That's the reason we present to you the numbers, taking into account year '17 and IFRS16. Okay? So it's a process. We are leader in this process, and we are quite happy."

I would like to start underlining the main milestones of the period. Again, a quarter of solid execution both operationally and financially.

Revenues grow 15%; our adjusted EBITDA, around 20%; and our recurring leveraged free cash flow are almost 11%. We continue to deliver on organic performance posting a solid growth in line with our medium-term guidance. 
I would also like to emphasize that Iliad continues to generate a steady flow of colocations in Italy, and that we are now hosting new clients in France and Switzerland.

If we go to Slide 5 it shows the historical performance of our key value metrics from 2014 through 2018. As you can see, revenues, adjusted EBITDA and recurring leveraged free cash flow have grown 20% annually, a growth that has allowed these metrics to be -- to double in just 4 years. 
Moving to Slide 6, total PoPs have increased 12% in the period, including the contribution of both organic growth and change of perimeter. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased 4.5%, above our medium-term guidance of 3% to 4%. This is mainly due to the continued densification trend in Europe and the contribution from Iliad in Italy. Finally, DAS nodes have increased by 20%, and we believe that the strong credentials we are building in these areas of DAS, Small Cells and mitigation solutions will translate into significant opportunities in the future.
On Slide 7, you can see a list of the various commercial initiatives we have on the table right now in order to secure further organic growth. In summary, Iliad is now generating organic growth in Italy and France, and we believe that there is room to continue strengthening this very good relationship. We are seeing further demand of our -- for our portfolio of sites in France and Switzerland with initial colocations from Swisscom and Salt already in place. And finally, we are levering on CommsCon prevention as to deploy more projects in the area of indoor coverage across Europe.
Moving to Slide 8. You can see here the building blocks of our adjusted EBITDA performance in the period. The positive impact of organic growth and efficiencies achieved is reinforced by the contribution of new deals, which explains the strong adjusted EBITDA in the period of 20%. The dark blue column on the right-hand side represents the positive impact at adjusted EBITDA level of adopting IFRS16 reaching EUR 439 million in the period.
I will now move to our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period of -- in the period on Slide 9. I would like to highlight that our revenues grew 15% and that under IFRS16 our adjusted EBITDA grows 19% and our EBITDA margin reaches 68%, a significant margin expansion of around 200 basis points compared to the same period last year.
Moving now to the table. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Service coupled with a very well-managed cost base, leads to the 90% adjusted EBITDA growth already mentioned. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital is positive due to implementation of management measures. Interest pay we pay our coupons as scheduled and tax, our initiatives in place on payments during the fiscal year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 10. It is important to remind that adoption of IFRS16 provides a better comparability with peers as it equalizes treatment of land ownership and the management of ground leases. Our leverage ratio reaches 4.9x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution to debt and adjusted EBITDA from IFRS16 as well as the full year contribution of new deals. Compared to December 2017, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and their associated cash as well as the capitalization of leases under IFRS16. Finally, it is important to highlight that we have a strong liquidity position of EUR 1.7 billion and a massive level of contracted revenues, a backlog of EUR 16 billion equivalent to 20 years of revenues. 
In Slide 11, you can see here the details of our debt structure and maturities profile, excluding the capitalization of lease liabilities. Our debt has an average maturity of around 6 years. No material refinancing is expected before 2022, and our inflation-linked revenues and fixed-rate debt allow us to expect positive impact from rising inflation. 
So in summary, we have a strong available liquidity, contracted revenues, long maturity, a very attractive cost of debt, a compelling business risk profile and no financing constraints. All this provide us with a wide array of options and flexibility to continue funding our growth strategy.
Finally, a few words on our guidance on Slide 12. We are reiterating our 2018 financial outlook, narrowing our estimate and aiming at the very top end of our full year range. As is always in Cellnex, we will leave the good for the very end. So we feel very positive about the performance of the company. This has been a very good year, and we hope to close this full year 2018 very successfully. 
And with this, we are now available to answer any question you may have. So let's please open the line."

And then finally, quite a high-level question, but as you've executed on your strategy over the past few years, you've begun to build scale and presence in quite a large number of areas outside macro towers. So it would be useful to understand that as you look at the diverse array of investment opportunities you have ahead of you, be it small cells, or fiber, or data centers and of course, macro towers, how do you prioritize each area? Is it still purely IRR or NPV? Or is there a particular area that has strategic value higher than the others?"

I mean, this is the part of the supply chain where we are quite far away, at least in Europe. I mean this is not a technical issue. I am talking about business model, different type of roles, et cetera. So we have also to understand that mobile edge computer -- edge computing should be amassed where we talk about industrial 5G services. I mean, when the latency requires less than 5 milliseconds latency. So this is not for the first day of 5G. This would be, let me say, a second wave of requirements from the 5G network. So our focus today is to expand the densification and maybe to work on the transmission before on the edge computing. Those are our priorities.

First question, I'm interested in the organic EBITDA growth on an adjusted basis.

And then back to your first question, I remind that you that basically rest of Europe for us is mostly France, and we are in the integration mode. We are basically building our portfolio of sites by acquisition and by construction of new sites in France, called Bouygues Telecom. Also, we have Switzerland, which is a portfolio of sites we have bought from Sunrise a few months ago, so we have already established our base there. And then we have also a presence in the U.K. and Netherlands with organic growth rates. That not changing. So I would say that rest of Europe as a whole is a mode that I would say is more in integration mode. It's not generating, so far, a huge contribution in terms of organic growth but on the same time, we are not seeing that the organic growth is declining."

The first one, it's straightforward, is on the provision for the workforce reduction you booked early this year. If you can just tell us how much of this has been used? And is it already generating cost savings for you? The second is on the DAS. We had a number of quarters or years with a lot of KPIs on the growth. I was wondering if you can start giving some financials. What's the contribution you get from DAS in revenues? And what sort of growth you're achieving on that segment? The third, it's a bit more open. It's on the M&A on -- there was a very brief comment in the start of the call reiterating that you will be very opportunistic. On Page 14, in the appendix, you show a chart whereby you basically highlight your ambitions of following your peers in the U.S. Now if somebody followed that chart, it says that the U.S. has flattened in terms of growth on their portfolio for exactly from the year where you are at the moment until year 8. So effectively they take a pause of 4 years before they start to build -- acquire new towers. Now given your balance sheet at the moment, somebody would wonder that potentially could happen to you because the fact there's not a lot of room today to do big acquisitions. So that's the question I'd ask is first of all, if that particular path something that you envisage to follow? And remain on the same topic, we're bombarded on our side about operator, that now they're very keen on monetizing their portfolio. We heard Deutsche for a number of quarters, if not years, potentially waiting to do with the rest of the towers. Vodafone is going to announce something next week, but it looks that they already did a tender for an outsourcing of 50 shared towers, whereby also your name was put on the frame. So I know that you cannot comment in terms of you're talking to and you're sort of, let's put that way, agreements you can engage, but could you tell us a bit of an idea about, first of all, are your approach is to complete your footprint where you are or potentially to enter new markets? If so, which of the markets are -- you basically set markets a few quarters ago. If those same markets still the one that you will be targeting? And second one, it's the -- in terms of the -- your balance sheet. With the IFRS16 you had a benefit to your gearing. Still, we're talking about potential capping at 6x net debt to EBITDA or something will change."

So what we try to give you here is what has happened and what could happen to us, but eventually it would not happen in the same way. So it's just aspirational. So do not track it every year. 
The following point is, it is true, 3 years ago and you -- all of you that are asking today, you have always been with us, and you have followed our equity study at the very beginning to explain that tower in Europe made sense, was difficult, was difficult. Because maybe some may not worth thinking of that. As of today, you are suggesting several names that seems to be thinking about. And this is a key point. The business model works. There is value. There is value to start. And I can tell you that we are working in this business model and in detail with ideas. 
Now one of the ideas that you are suggesting is about IFRS16 and impact on the balance sheet. You know, Ottavio, that IFRS16 is one of the most important change in accountancy in the last years. And we are very well prepared to face this new M&A pipeline, not only from an industrial perspective, which I think is key, but also from an accountancy perspective. When you talk about net debt EBITDA, when you raise your points about the balance sheet, obviously, the impact of IFRS16 is going to be important in the balance sheet of all the companies: MNOs, towering companies, retailers, everyone. So it's important to help ourselves, our clients and the community to explain that the metrics are going to change. So we are involved in this task, not only for us, but also for our clients and obviously talking to different stakeholders regarding credit: banks, rating agencies, bondholders. This is going to have an impact on the net debt EBITDA for sure. How much? Yet me let tell you that IFRS16 has not been yet implemented. Mandatorily speaking in Europe, this will start in January 1, 2019. At the moment we will see the results, and I can tell you that we will be ready to have a new view on balance sheet evolution. But many times, we think or we feel that the stakeholders have not adapted yet. That's the reason we present to you the numbers, taking into account year '17 and IFRS16. Okay? So it's a process. We are leader in this process, and we are quite happy."
