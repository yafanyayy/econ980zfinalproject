Today, we are reporting strong results for another productive year. Utility, Parent & Other, our core business, exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, and our consolidated operational earnings were in the top half of our guidance range and also higher than expectations -- than our executions.
We executed on our key 2017 deliverables. At the utility, we had an active regulatory calendar and we continue to gain certainty from major product -- projects in our capital plan. We received approval to build 2 new highly efficient gas-fired generating resources. All of our jurisdictions approved our plans to implement AMI in the respective service areas. For transmission, we completed another MTEP cycle. We made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station. We completed 3 annual formula rate plans in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and we implemented 2 cost recovery factors increases in taxes. We are in discussions the extend Entergy Louisiana's annual FRP. We continue the path on clarity on our exit from the emerging business in 2022, and we raised our dividend for the third consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue subject as always to board approval.
Our accomplishments this year are simply a continuation of the path we set several years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders. We set out to be company that delivers strong financial results to its owners, invest in its employees to rate a workforce for the future, and is environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for its communities while maintaining some of the lowest rates in the country for customers.
Our key deliverables support this aspiration for our company. As we look ahead to 2018 and our 3-year outlook, our success is less dependent on strategic initiatives and more on our own operational execution. As a result, today, we are initiating 2018 guidance consistent with our previous disclosures, and we are affirming our utility parent and other longer-term outlook through 2020. Beyond that, we continue to see a good bet for steady predictable growth at our core business as we continue to modernize our infrastructure. We are laying the foundation now to be the sustainable solutions-oriented utility of the future that provides customer-focused innovation in a changing world.
Shifting now to 2017, let's review some details behind our key accomplishments that keep us on track to attain both our near-term goals and our longer-term aspirations.
On the regulatory front, we successfully completed Entergy Arkansas' second forward test year FRP with rates effective last month. The commission approved our comprehensive settlement agreement, which, among other matters, verified the prudence of the nuclear costs included in the 2017 and 2018 test year filings. Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to extend its plan for another 3 years. While the settlement talks had slowed to ensure partes understand the implications of tax reform, discussions have been productive and are ongoing.
With respect to our large generation projects, we received approval to build the Lake Charles and Montgomery County Power Stations. With the St. Charles Power Station, these projects are an important part of our investment plan to modernize the electric grid and improve reliability. All 3 are on schedule and we are confident and successful, on-time and on budget execution. We've also made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station with the Council utility committee's approval of the project earlier this week. We expect the full council to take up the certification for a final decision on March 8. 
We also made strides in transmission. We invested approximately $1 billion and placed more than $900 million of capital projects into service. We also made significant progress on the Lake Charles Transmission Project. This is our largest transmission endeavored to date, and it includes 30 miles of extra high-voltage transmission line and addresses reliability needs driven in part by load growth in Southwest Louisiana. We expect to complete the project in second quarter 2018. We wrapped up the 2017 MTEP review and MISO approved 70 projects in our service area totaling approximately $1 billion. 
Regarding the growth and transformation of our distribution system, we have now received regulatory approvals for the deployment of advanced meters in all of our jurisdictions. The IT infrastructure, communications networks and meter data management systems that will enable the meters to be smart are being constructed. We are pleased with the progress we've made on AMI in each of our jurisdictions and the positive feedback we continue to receive from our stakeholders especially regarding the benefits and future opportunities this technology will provide for our customers. The investments we make in our core business also improve our environmental footprint. We have one of the cleanest generating fleets in the United States, and our principal objective is to remain an environmentally sustainable fleet for the communities we serve. The cornerstone of this objective began when we were the first U.S. utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing CO2 emissions in 2001. 
10 years later, our commitment went beyond merely stabilizing CO2 emissions. In 2011, our environment 2020 commitment included a voluntary pledge that through the year 2020, we would maintain our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels on a cumulative bases. I'm pleased to report that we are meeting our commitments and the investments we're making will enable us to continue to lower our emission rates at the utility. For example, highly efficient combined cycle power station such as, St. Charles, Lake Charles in Montgomery County will produce pure carbon emissions than the legacy unit they replace, improve our average fleet efficiency and use less water.
Nuclear generation is also an important non-emitting baseload resource. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable assets is an important part of our strategy to deliver sustainable value to all of our stakeholders.
Our planned investments in new technologies to modernize our grid such as advanced meters will further improve efficiency. On top of that, our customers of all classes are interested in the deployment of renewable resources, and we are working to meet these expectations. To that end, over the next 3 years, we expect to contract for over 800 megawatts of renewable resources. Of these, approximately 180 megawatts are the 2 power purchase agreements in Arkansas that we have discussed with you on previous occasions. Of the remainder, approximately half represent ownership opportunities.
These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we are making today to develop an electric generating and delivery system that is well-positioned for operations in a carbon constrained economy whatever that may look like in the future.
Turning to EWC, we've taken important steps to provide a clear path to exit that business in 2022. We reached an agreement to cease operations -- in 2021 and submitted our deactivation notice to New York ISO. The ISO concluded there will be no reliability issues resulting from any retirement. We sold FitzPatrick preserving the plants benefits for its employees and community, and we decided to continue to operate Palisades through the spring of 2022, a cash positive decision. 
Finally, in 2017, we received a number of awards that recognize our accomplishments, values and commitments. We were once again included in the Dow Jones sustainability North America index. We are named one of the top 10 utilities in economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Women's Business Enterprise National Council listed Entergy as 1 of America's top corporations for women's business enterprise. We are 1 of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and we received EEI's emergency recovery and emergency assistance awards for our storm restoration efforts.
Our commitment to our communities is further evidenced by our charitable contributions, which total approximately $16 million annually, including investment in workforce development across our jurisdictions. Our employees and retirees are also generous with our time, volunteering some 100,000 hours annually.
All of our accomplishments and successes are the result of our employees first rate level dedication and hard work everyday. I want to thank the more than 13,000 men and women of Entergy for living by our values, working safely and acting with integrity. Their ideas and kindred spirit make Entergy a better company.
Looking ahead, our 2018 plans support our financial outlooks as well as our aspirations for the future of our company. As I mentioned earlier, the foundation for success this year is largely in place and less dependent on strategic initiatives and on our own operational execution.
We'll be building projects that have already been approved, continuing with the annual MISO MTEP process in making regulatory filings in the normal course of business. 2 major transmission projects we will complete this year for the Lake Charles project noted earlier and the $130 million Southwest Mississippi improvement project. We look forward to their completion and the benefits that they will provide to our customers and to our region.
We will also complete AMI's core IT system implementations and initiate deployment of the communications network. This will support meter installations beginning earlier next year when customers will start to see the benefits this technology provides giving them the ability to manage their usage and their bills.
Another important goal for 2018 is for ANO to exit Column 4. Over the past few years, we have worked with the NRC as well as our peers, and we have systematically completed the actions outlined in our confirmatory action letter. ANO is on track to return to normal oversight this year. 
As for our regulatory agenda, we are working with each of our regulators on the effective tax reform and we welcome the change for our customers. On an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate means that customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been. That's important to us as evidenced by the fact that our rates are among the lowest in the country. We plan to make rate filings in each of our jurisdictions this year, and we expect tax reform to be addressed in the normal course of those proceedings. We are also focused on efforts to address customer needs in unique ways. For example, in Mississippi, working with the Public Service Commission, we are teaming up with ceasefire on a fiber infrastructure project. This project will span over 300 miles and 15 counties to bring next generation broadband services to consumers and businesses in some of the most isolated and rural parts of the state. These services will open doors that were not previously available in those areas.
At EWC, we will remain focused on safe and reliable operations to finish strong in the last few years of operation. Regarding our BUI Northstar transaction, we have made substantial progress towards finalizing an agreement and we filed a status update with the Vermont Public Utility Commission earlier this week. As the report states, the parties anticipate filing a memorandum of understanding by March 2. If some or all of the parties will join, the MOU will address financial assurance and site restoration standards. We still target closing the transaction by the end of 2018.
All of these plans support our gardens and are the foundation for our long-term outlooks, which we affirm today. Drew will provide additional color around our forward-looking commitments. 
2017 has been another year of significant accomplishments for our company, accomplishments that will help provide the foundation for our pursuit of the much broader aspirations we have set for ourselves. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We are simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. For years, we've been committed to creating sustainable value for our owners, customers, employees and communities, a commitment that many investors are recognizing as essential to success over the long term. That has been reflected not only in the steps we have taken to exit the EWC business and strengthen the utility but also in our leadership position among utilities and critical measures of sustainability including our recognition as an environmentally and socially responsible utility. Our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. All of this prepares us to meet the challenges of an evolving industry. Over the next 3 years, we will continue to strengthen and deliver on our commitment to our stakeholders. We will place into service new, clean, efficient generating resources; new transmission projects throughout our service territory; and, of course, AMI. AMI and its related technologies will serve as the foundation on, which we plan to build the Entergy of tomorrow.
As new technologies data and analytics continue to improve, so too our ability to deliver tailored customer solutions that better meet our evolving customer expectations through a dynamic, integrated energy network and new products and services beyond basic power delivery. We want to be in a position to deliver the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for the future, a future that offers transformative change and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we are eager to lead the way.
Before I turn it over to Drew, I'm excited to announce that we will host our Analyst Day conference in New York City on June 21. Our main objective will be to give you a view of our 5-year outlook and our plan for operational execution. We will also continue the conversation on how we define our company beyond 5 years. Stay tuned for more details. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2017 financial results, the implications of tax reform for our company, 2018 guidance and our 3-year outlooks."

As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for our significant accomplishments.

As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for our significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished on the top half of our operational guidance range exceeding our expectations for the year despite the negative effects of weather.
This is better than we told you to expect on our third quarter call primarily driven by 2 factors. First, at utility. We experienced strong sales growth led by our industrial sector, which came in at 7% quarter-over-quarter. Second, we saw benefits from our continued efforts to derisk our EWC business. For Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we also ended above our expectation and above the top end of our guidance range due to the strong sales growth.
Beyond the financial results, we also know that tax reform is on your mind. Leo mentioned that new legislation will provide significant benefits to our customers. Over time, we'll return approximately $1.4 billion for the unprotected portion of the excess ABIT in 1 form or another, whether through customer refunds, cash investments and new assets, accelerated depreciation or other options our regulars may consider. And on an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate will translate into lower bills that our customers would have otherwise. In addition, our 2018 guidance and the longer-term outlook we're affirming today include expectations for the effective tax reform.
I'll now turn to some of the drivers for our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our core business Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 6.
On an adjusted view, earnings were $0.21 higher than fourth quarter 2016 driven by strong sales growth. For the investor class, we saw robust sales from existing customers largely from the chlor-alkali metal sectors as well as new and expansion customers. We also recorded nonrecurring regulatory charges totaling $0.10 in fourth quarter 2016. Higher non-fuel O&M partially offset these benefits primarily due to higher nuclear spending as we continue to drive our nuclear strategic plan.
At EWC, on Slide 7, operational earnings increased $0.39 quarter-over-quarter. FitzPatrick contributed an $0.11 loss to fourth quarter 2016 results and the sale of that plant in 2017 affected variances from multiple line items.
Excluding the effect of FitzPatrick, earnings increased to $0.28 due largely to higher income from realized earnings on decommissioning trust, which we highlighted as an opportunity in our third quarter call.
Strong market performance increased trust value to a level where we lock in gain by rebalancing some of the truck investment towards lower volatility fixed income instruments.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $911 million, approximately $155 million higher than a year ago. The increase is primarily due to collections of fuel purchased power cost at utility.
Now turning to the full year on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2017 were $7.20 per share, higher than the $7.11 in 2016. It's also above our guidance midpoint despite negative whether and better than our expectations in October. As I mentioned, drivers for the change versus our expectation included strong sales growth at utility and higher realized earnings on decommissioning trust. 
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.50 in 2017, $0.18 higher than 2016. The increase is due largely to rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit our customers as well as residential, commercial and industrial weather adjusted sales growth. This increase is partly offset by higher spending on nuclear operations and other operating expenses.
Slide 11 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which increased year-over-year to $3.24 per share in 2017 from $2.01 in 2016. Excluding FitzPatrick, this increase was due largely to income tax items and as previously mentioned, higher realized gains on decommissioning trust funds. 2017 results also reflected higher decommissioning expense primarily from the establishment of decommissioning liabilities -- in August 2016.
Full year 2017 operating cash flow shown on Slide 12 was approximately $2.6 billion in 2017, $375 million lower than last year. Higher refueling managed cost as we completed 7 refueling outages this year at both the merchant and the utility fleet, unfavorable utility and lower EWC net revenue were the main drivers.
Today, we are issuing our 2018 consolidated operational EPS guidance of $6.25 to $6.85 and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance of $4.50 to $4.90.
On Slide 13, starting with Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, our range is consistent with the outlook we presented at the EEI conference last November. Walking through a few of the key drivers, let's start with the top line.
Our projected sales volume 2018 is largely unchanged from our view at EEI, and our guidance reflects a slight decline year-over-year. However, we expect volatility from quarter to quarter. For example, we expect industrial sales growth in the first quarter as new customers become fully operational, but we expect sales declines over the remainder of the year as existing customers return to normal operation and take maintenance outages following strong performance in 2017. Despite the tempered outlook for our industrial sales growth in 2018, we see growth resuming in 2019 and 2020 as new projects come online.
We are projecting nonfuel O&M to be approximately $2.6 billion, which represents a slight increase compared to 2017. This reflects slightly higher pension expense due to a pension discount rate assumption of 3.78%, which is lower than our previous expectation.
Return of excess ABIT affects the top line but essential offset in income tax expense. 2018 also assumes normal weather and no income tax landing items at Utility, Parent & Other.
Additionally, as a result of tax reform at Parent & Other, we see a lower tax yield on that segment's loss. We also expect higher financing cost. At the Utility, the tax change will affect each operating company differently and we expect a more significant impact to be in Entergy Arkansas. Because of the mechanics of the FRP, Entergy Arkansas can earn closer to its allowed return in 2018. This is a good driver that helped offset the negative drag at Parent this year.
At EWC, we expect earnings to decline in 2018 largely due to income tax planning items. As you recall, in second quarter 2017, EWC recorded an income tax benefit contributing $373 million to operational earnings. This year, we are summing that EWC will record another tax benefit currently estimated to be approximately $100 million. In addition, we expect lower net revenue largely due to lower energy prices and higher nonfuel O&M due to higher projected nuclear spending partly due to the decision to operate Palisades until 2022. These decreases are offset by lower depreciation expense also due to the Palisades decision and higher earnings on decommissioning trust is the change in accounting rules require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market.
Right now our guidance reflect a return assumption of 6.25%, which equates to approximately $1 in earnings per share. We also expect lower income tax expense due to the lower income tax rate.
Before we leave EWC, I'll give a update on our cash position. We now see neutral to positive cash flow from EWC to the Parent from 2017 to 2022 and this includes our current view on potential decommissioning trust contributions. This is slightly better than last quarter due to walking strong nuclear decommissioning trust returns and continued strategies to mitigate nuclear decommissioning because.
Tax reform will also affect our cash needs. And as shown on Slide 14, we will require incremental financing. The 2 primary needs are from, first, the return of excess deferred taxes and, second lower tax expense and rate. We expect the finance reduction through a accommodation of utility company debt, parent debt, internal cash generation and external equity. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period. And currently, we expect that all to occur before the end of 2019. 
Moving to the long-term view on Slide 15, our earnings expectations continue to firm up as we execute on key deliverables. Our outlook through 2020 is unchanged despite the Parent drag that I purposely noted. That's in part because we will see increased rate base as we return excess ABIT to customers over time. Also, before tax reform, we were trending at the upper end of our ranges in '19 and '20. Collectively, these allow us to maintain our outlook. While I don't normally talk about where in these outlooks we see ourselves, given the significant changes in tax reform, you should know that we do not see ourselves at the bottom of the ranges. Of course, these are our current expectations but ultimately the amount and timing of earnings and cash impacts from tax reform will depend on the regulatory treatment. All of our jurisdictions have opened a docket in 1 form or another, and ratemaking regulatory proceedings are scheduled this year in each of our jurisdictions.
We will work with our regulators through these proceedings to address the effective tax reform and develop the appropriate path forward so that this opportunity gets value to our customers as fast as possible. And also provide all of our Entergy stakeholders with a fair and reasonable outcome.
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 16. The reduction in cash from tax reform will also put pressure on our FFO to debt credit metric. Even though this metric would be adversely affected, we are focused on maintaining the financial integrity of the utilities profile by internally identifying the opportunities to improve cash flow and externally working with our retail regulators. Throughout, we expect to continue to hold an investment grade rating. 
As I mentioned earlier, 2017 was another strong year our results and we look forward to 2018. The foundation for success this year is largely in place as we focus on building projects that have already been approved, advance our operational capabilities, work with the regulators to implement appropriate changes and tax reform and prepare for the customer-centered and opportunity-filled future that Leo described in his remarks. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Today, we are reporting strong results for another productive year. Utility, Parent & Other, our core business, exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, and our consolidated operational earnings were in the top half of our guidance range and also higher than expectations -- than our expectations.
[indiscernible] we executed on our key 2017 deliverables. At the Utility, we had an active regulatory calendar, and we continued to gain certainty from major product -- projects in our capital plan. We received approval to build 2 new highly efficient gas-fired-generating resources. All of our jurisdictions approved our plans to implement AMI in their respective service areas. 
For transmission, we completed another MTEP cycle. We made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station. We completed 3 annual formula rate plans in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and we implemented 2 cost recovery factor increases in Texas. We are in discussions to extend Entergy Louisiana's annual FRP. We continue [indiscernible] the path to continued clarity on our exit from the merchant business in 2022, and we raised our dividend for the third consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue subject, as always, to board approval.
Our accomplishments this year are simply a continuation of the path we set several years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders. We set out to be a company that delivers strong financial results to its owners, invest in its employees to create a workforce for the future, and is an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for its communities while maintaining some of the lowest rates in the country for customers.
Our key deliverables support this aspiration for our company. As we look ahead to 2018 and our 3-year outlook period, our success is less dependent on strategic initiatives and more on our own operational execution. As a result, today, we are initiating 2018 guidance consistent with our previous disclosures, and we are affirming our Utility, Parent & Other longer-term outlook through 2020. Beyond that, we continue to see a good path for steady, predictable growth at our core business as we continue to modernize our infrastructure. We are laying the foundation now to be the sustainable solutions-oriented utility of the future that provides customer-focused innovation in a changing world.
Shifting now to 2017, let's review some details behind our key accomplishments that keep us on track to attain both our near-term goals and our longer-term aspirations.
On the regulatory front, we successfully completed Entergy Arkansas' second forward test year FRP, with rates effective last month. The commission approved our comprehensive settlement agreement, which, among other matters, verified the prudence of the nuclear costs included in the 2017 and 2018 test year filings. 
Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to extend its formula rate plan for another 3 years. While the settlement talks have slowed to ensure parties understand the implications of tax reform, discussions have been productive and are ongoing.
With respect to our large generation projects, we received approval to build the Lake Charles and Montgomery County Power Stations. With the St. Charles Power Station, these projects are an important part of our investment plan to modernize the electric grid and improve reliability. All 3 are on schedule and we are confident and successful, on-time and on-budget execution. We've also made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station with the Council Utility Committee's approval of the project earlier this week. We expect the full council to take up the certification for a final decision on March 8.
We also made strides in transmission. We invested approximately $1 billion and placed more than $900 million of capital projects into service. We also made significant progress on the Lake Charles Transmission Project. This is our largest transmission endeavored to date, and it includes 30 miles of extra high-voltage transmission line and addresses reliability needs, driven in part by load growth in Southwest Louisiana. We expect to complete the project in second quarter 2018. We wrapped up the 2017 MTEP review and MISO approved 70 projects in our service area, totaling approximately $1 billion. 
Regarding the growth and transformation of our distribution system, we have now received regulatory approvals for the deployment of advanced meters in all of our jurisdictions. The IT infrastructure, communications networks and meter data management systems that will enable the meters to be smart are being constructed. We are pleased with the progress we've made on AMI in each of our jurisdictions and the positive feedback we continue to receive from our stakeholders especially regarding the benefits and future opportunities this technology will provide for our customers. The investments we make in our core business also improve our environmental footprint. We have one of the cleanest generating fleets in the United States, and our principal objective is to remain an environmentally sustainable fleet for the communities we serve. The cornerstone of this objective began when we were the first U.S. utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing CO2 emissions in 2001. 
10 years later, our commitment went beyond merely stabilizing CO2 emissions. In 2011, our environment 2020 commitment included a voluntary pledge that through the year 2020, we would maintain our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels on a cumulative basis. I'm pleased to report that we are meeting our commitments and the investments we are making will enable us to continue to lower our emission rates at the utility. For example, highly efficient combined cycle power stations, such as St. Charles, Lake Charles and Montgomery County, will produce pure carbon emissions than the legacy units they replace, improve our average fleet efficiency and use less water.
Nuclear generation is also an important non-emitting baseload resource. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable assets is an important part of our strategy to deliver sustainable value to all of our stakeholders.
Our planned investments in new technologies to modernize our grid, such as advanced meters, will further improve efficiency. On top of that, our customers of all classes are interested in the deployment of renewable resources, and we are working to meet these expectations. To that end, over the next 3 years, we expect to contract for over 800 megawatts of renewable resources. Of these, approximately 180 megawatts are the 2 power purchase agreements in Arkansas that we have discussed with you on previous occasions. Of the remainder, approximately half represent ownership opportunities.
These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we are making today to develop an electric generating and delivery system that is well-positioned for operations in a carbon-constrained economy, whatever that may look like in the future.
Turning to EWC, we've taken important steps to provide a clear path to exit that business in 2022. We reached an agreement to cease operations of Indian Point in 2021 and submitted our deactivation notice to New York ISO. The ISO concluded there will be no reliability issues resulting from Indian Point's retirement. We sold FitzPatrick, preserving the plant's benefits for its employees and community, and we decided to continue to operate Palisades through the spring of 2022, a cash-positive decision. 
Finally, in 2017, we received a number of awards that recognize our accomplishments, values and commitments. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index. We are named one of the top 10 utilities in economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Women's Business Enterprise National Council listed Entergy as one of America's top corporations for women's business enterprise. We are 1 of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and we received EEI's emergency recovery and emergency assistance awards for our storm-restorations efforts.
Our commitment to our communities is further evidenced by our charitable contributions, which total approximately $16 million annually, including investment in workforce development across our jurisdictions. Our employees and retirees are also generous with their time, volunteering some 100,000 hours annually.
All of our accomplishments and successes are the result of our employees' first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work every day. I want to thank the more than 13,000 men and women of Entergy for living by our values, working safely and acting with integrity. Their ideas and can do spirit make Entergy a better company.
Looking ahead, our 2018 plans support our financial outlooks as well as our aspirations for the future of our company. As I mentioned earlier, the foundation for success this year is largely in place and less dependent on strategic initiatives and on our own operational execution.
We'll be building projects that have already been approved, continuing with the annual MISO MTEP process in making regulatory filings in the normal course of business. 2 major transmission projects we will complete this year are the Lake Charles project noted earlier and the $130 million Southwest Mississippi improvement project. We look forward to their completion and the benefits that they will provide to our customers and to our region.
We will also complete AMI's core IT system implementations and initiate deployment of the communications network. This will support meter installations beginning early next year when customers will start to see the benefits this technology provides, giving them the ability to manage their usage and their bills.
Another important goal for 2018 is for ANO to exit Column 4. Over the past few years, we have worked with the NRC as well as our peers, and we have systematically completed the actions outlined in our confirmatory action letter. ANO is on track to return to normal oversight this year. 
As for our regulatory agenda, we are working with each of our regulators on the effects of tax reform and we welcome the change for our customers. On an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate means that customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been. That's important to us as evidenced by the fact that our rates are among the lowest in the country. We plan to make rate filings in each of our jurisdictions this year, and we expect tax reform to be addressed in the normal course of those proceedings. We are also focused on efforts to address customer needs in unique ways. For example, in Mississippi, working with the Public Service Commission, we are teaming up with C Spire on a fiber infrastructure project. This project will span over 300 miles in 15 counties to bring next-generation broadband services to consumers and businesses in some of the most isolated and rural parts of the state. These services will open doors that were not previously available in those areas.
At EWC, we will remain focused on safe and reliable operations to finish strong in the last few years of operation. Regarding our VY Northstar transaction, we have made substantial progress towards finalizing an agreement then we filed a status update with the Vermont Public Utility Commission earlier this week. As the report states, the parties anticipate filing a memorandum of understanding by March 2. If some or all of the parties will join, the MOU will address financial assurances and site restoration standards. We still target closing the transaction by the end of 2018.
All of these plans support our guidance and are the foundation for our long-term outlooks, which we affirm today. Drew will provide additional color around our forward-looking commitments. 
2017 has been another year of significant accomplishments for our company, accomplishments that will help provide the foundation for our pursuit of the much broader aspirations we have set for ourselves. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We are a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. For years, we've been committed to creating sustainable value for our owners, customers, employees and communities, a commitment that many investors are recognizing as essential to success over the long term. That has been reflected not only in the steps we have taken to exit the EWC business and strengthen the utility but also in our leadership position among utilities and critical measures of sustainability, including our recognition as an environmentally and socially responsible in utility. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. All of this prepares us to meet the challenges of an evolving industry. Over the next 3 years, we will continue to strengthen and deliver on our commitment to our stakeholders. We will place into service new, clean, efficient, generating resources; new transmission projects throughout our service territory; and, of course, AMI. AMI and its related technologies will serve as the foundation on which we plan to build the Entergy of tomorrow.
As new technologies, data and analytics continue to improve, so too of our ability to deliver tailored customer solutions that better meet our evolving customer expectations through a dynamic, integrated energy network and new products and services beyond basic power delivery. We want to be in a position to deliver the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for the future, a future that offers transformative change and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we are eager to lead the way.
Before I turn it over to Drew, I'm excited to announce that we will host our Analyst Day conference in New York City on June 21. Our main objective will be to give you a view of our 5-year outlook and our plan for operational execution. We will also continue the conversation on how we define our company beyond 5 years. Stay tuned for more details. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2017 financial results, the implications of tax reform for our company, 2018 guidance and our 3-year outlooks."

As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for us with significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished in the top half of our operational guidance range, ex",1718,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for us with significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished in the top half of our operational guidance range, exceeding our expectations for the year despite the negative effects of weather.
This is better than we told you to expect on our third quarter call primarily driven by 2 factors. First, at Utility, we experienced strong sales growth led by our industrial sector, which came in at 7% quarter-over-quarter. Second, we saw benefits from our continued efforts to de-risk our EWC business. For Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we also ended above our expectations and above the top end of our guidance range due to the strong sales growth.
Beyond the financial results, we also know that tax reform is on your mind. Leo mentioned that new legislation will provide significant benefits to our customers. Over time, we'll return approximately $1.4 billion for the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT, in one form or another, whether through customer refunds, cash investments and new assets, accelerated depreciation or other options our regulators may consider. And on an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate will translate into lower bills than our customers would have otherwise. In addition, our 2018 guidance and the longer-term outlook we're affirming today include expectations for the effective tax reform.
I'll now turn to some of the drivers for our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our core business, Utility, Parent & Other, on Slide 6.
On an adjusted view, earnings were $0.21 higher than fourth quarter 2016, driven by strong sales growth. For the investor class, we saw robust sales from existing customers, largely from the chlor-alkali and primary metal sectors as well as new and expansion customers. We also recorded nonrecurring regulatory charges totaling $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2016. Higher non-fuel O&M partially offset these benefits, primarily due to higher nuclear spending as we continue to drive our nuclear strategic plan.
At EWC, on Slide 7, operational earnings increased $0.39 quarter-over-quarter. FitzPatrick contributed an $0.11 loss to fourth quarter 2016 results and the sale of that plant in 2017 affected variances from multiple line items.
Excluding the effect of FitzPatrick, earnings increased to $0.28 due largely to higher income from realized earnings on decommissioning trust, which we highlighted as an opportunity on our third quarter call.
Strong market performance increased trust value to a level where we locked in gains by rebalancing some of the trust investment towards lower-volatility fixed-income instruments.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $911 million, approximately $155 million higher than a year ago. The increase is primarily due to collections of fuel and purchased power cost at Utility.
Now turning to the full year on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2017 were $7.20 per share, higher than the $7.11 in 2016. It was also above our guidance midpoint despite negative weather and better than our expectations in October. As I mentioned, drivers for the change versus our expectation included strong sales growth at the Utility and higher realized earnings on decommissioning trust. 
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.50 in 2017, $0.18 higher than 2016. The increase is due largely to rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit our customers as well as residential, commercial and industrial weather-adjusted sales growth. This increase is partly offset by higher spending on nuclear operations and other operating expenses.
Slide 11 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which increased year-over-year to $3.24 per share in 2017 from $2.01 in 2016. Excluding FitzPatrick, this increase was due largely to income tax items and as previously mentioned, higher realized gains on decommissioning trust funds. 2017 results also reflected higher decommissioning expense primarily from the establishment of decommissioning liabilities at Indian Point 3 in August 2016.
Full year 2017 operating cash flow, shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2017, $375 million lower than last year. Higher refueling outage cost as we completed 7 refueling outages this year at both the merchant and the utility fleet, unfavorable weather at utility and lower EWC net revenue were the main drivers.
Today, we are issuing our 2018 consolidated operational EPS guidance of $6.25 to $6.85 and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance of $4.50 to $4.90.
On Slide 13, starting with Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, our range is consistent with the outlook we presented at the EEI conference last November. Walking through a few of the key drivers, let's start with the top line.
Our projected sales volume in 2018 is largely unchanged from our view at EEI, and our guidance reflects a slight decline year-over-year. However, we expect volatility from quarter to quarter. For example, we expect industrial sales growth in the first quarter as new customers become fully operational, but we expect sales declines over the remainder of the year as existing customers return to normal operation and take maintenance outages following strong performance in 2017. Despite the tempered outlook for our industrial sales growth in 2018, we see growth resuming in 2019 and 2020 as new projects come online.
We are projecting nonfuel O&M to be approximately $2.6 billion, which represents a slight increase compared to 2017. This reflects slightly higher pension expense due to a pension discount rate assumption of 3.78%, which is lower than our previous expectation.
Return of excess ADIT affects the top line but is essentially offset in income tax expense. 2018 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at Utility, Parent & Other.
Additionally, as a result of tax reform at Parent & Other, we'll see a lower tax yield on that segment's loss. We also expect higher financing cost. At the Utility, the tax change will affect each operating company differently, and we expect a more significant impact to be in Entergy Arkansas. Because of the mechanics of the FRP, Entergy Arkansas can earn closer to its allowed return in 2018. This is a key driver that helps offset the negative drag at Parent this year.
At EWC, we expect earnings to decline in 2018 largely due to income tax planning items. As you recall, in second quarter 2017, EWC recorded an income tax benefit contributing $373 million to operational earnings. This year, we are assuming that EWC will record another tax benefit currently estimated to be approximately $100 million. In addition, we expect lower net revenue, largely due to lower energy prices and higher nonfuel O&M due to higher projected nuclear spending, partly due to the decision to operate Palisades until 2022. These decreases are offset by lower depreciation expense, also due to the Palisades decision, and higher earnings on decommissioning trust due to the change in accounting rules that require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market.
Right now, our guidance reflects a return to assumption of 6.25%, which equates to approximately $1 in earnings per share. We also expect lower income tax expense due to the lower income tax rate.
Before we leave EWC, I'll give a quick update on our cash position. We now see neutral to positive cash flow from EWC to Parent from 2017 to 2022, and this includes our current view on potential decommissioning trust contributions. This is slightly better than last quarter due to locking in strong nuclear decommissioning trust returns and continued strategies to mitigate nuclear decommissioning costs.
Tax reform will also affect our cash needs. And as shown on Slide 14, we will require incremental financing. The 2 primary needs are from: first, the return of excess deferred taxes; and second, lower tax expense and rate. We expect to finance this reduction through a combination of utility company debt, parent debt, internal cash generation and external equity. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period. And currently, we expect that all to occur before the end of 2019. 
Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 15, our earnings expectations continue to firm up as we execute on key deliverables. Our outlook through 2020 is unchanged, despite the Parent drag that I previously noted. That's in part because we will see increased rate base as we return excess ADIT to customers over time. Also, before tax reform, we were trending at the upper end of our ranges in '19 and '20. Collectively, these allow us to maintain our outlooks. While I don't normally talk about where in these outlooks we see ourselves, given the significant changes in tax reform, you should know that we do not see ourselves at the bottom of the ranges. Of course, these are our current expectations but ultimately the amount and timing of earnings and cash impacts from tax reform will depend on the regulatory treatment. All of our jurisdictions have opened a docket in one form or another, and rat-making regulatory proceedings are scheduled this year in each of our jurisdictions.
We will work with our regulators through these proceedings to address the effects of tax reform and develop the appropriate path forward so that this opportunity gets value to our customers as fast as possible, but also provide all of our Entergy stakeholders with a fair and reasonable outcome.
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 16. The reduction in cash from tax reform will also put pressure on our FFO to debt credit metric. Even though this metric would be adversely affected, we are focused on maintaining the financial integrity of the utilities profile by internally identifying the opportunities to improve cash flow and externally working with our retail regulators. Throughout, we expect to continue to hold an investment-grade rating. 
As I mentioned earlier, 2017 was another strong year of results and we look forward to 2018. The foundation for success this year is largely in place as we focus on building projects that have already been approved, advance our operational capabilities, work with our regulators to implement appropriate changes in light of the tax reform and prepare for the customer-centered and opportunity-filled future that Leo described in his remarks. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

So we have actually built in an expectation that over the longer term, we would expect to see a decline in residential and commercial sales."

Today, we are reporting strong results for another productive year. Utility, Parent & Other, our core business, exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, and our consolidated operational earnings were in the top half of our guidance range and also higher than expectations -- than our expectations.
[indiscernible] we executed on our key 2017 deliverables. At the Utility, we had an active regulatory calendar, and we continued to gain certainty from major product -- projects in our capital plan. We received approval to build 2 new highly efficient gas-fired-generating resources. All of our jurisdictions approved our plans to implement AMI in their respective service areas. 
For transmission, we completed another MTEP cycle. We made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station. We completed 3 annual formula rate plans in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and we implemented 2 cost recovery factor increases in Texas. We are in discussions to extend Entergy Louisiana's annual FRP. We continued along the path to continued clarity on our exit from the merchant business in 2022, and we raised our dividend for the third consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue subject, as always, to board approval.
Our accomplishments this year are simply a continuation of the path we set several years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders. We set out to be a company that delivers strong financial results to its owners, invests in its employees to create a workforce for the future, and is an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for its communities while maintaining some of the lowest rates in the country for customers.
Our key deliverables support this aspiration for our company. As we look ahead to 2018 and our 3-year outlook period, our success is less dependent on strategic initiatives and more on our own operational execution. As a result, today, we are initiating 2018 guidance consistent with our previous disclosures, and we are affirming our Utility, Parent & Other longer-term outlook through 2020. Beyond that, we continue to see a good path for steady, predictable growth at our core business as we continue to modernize our infrastructure. We are laying the foundation now to be the sustainable solutions-oriented utility of the future that provides customer-focused innovation in a changing world.
Shifting now to 2017, let's review some details behind our key accomplishments that keep us on track to attain both our near-term goals and our longer-term aspirations.
On the regulatory front, we successfully completed Entergy Arkansas' second forward test year FRP, with rates effective last month. The commission approved our comprehensive settlement agreement, which, among other matters, verified the prudence of the nuclear costs included in the 2017 and 2018 test year filings. 
Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to extend its formula rate plan for another 3 years. While the settlement talks have slowed to ensure parties understand the implications of tax reform, discussions have been productive and are ongoing.
With respect to our large generation projects, we received approval to build the Lake Charles and Montgomery County Power Stations. With the St. Charles Power Station, these projects are an important part of our investment plan to modernize the electric grid and improve reliability. All 3 are on schedule and we are confident and successful, on-time and on-budget execution. We've also made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station with the Council Utility Committee's approval of the project earlier this week. We expect the full council to take up the certification for a final decision on March 8.
  We also made strides in transmission. We invested approximately $1 billion and placed more than $900 million of capital projects into service. We also made significant progress on the Lake Charles Transmission Project. This is our largest transmission endeavored to-date, and it includes 30 miles of extra high-voltage transmission line and addresses reliability needs, driven in part by load growth in Southwest Louisiana. We expect to complete the project in second quarter 2018. We wrapped up the 2017 MTEP review and MISO approved 70 projects in our service area, totaling approximately $1 billion. 
  
  Regarding the growth and transformation of our distribution system, we have now received regulatory approvals for the deployment of advanced meters in all of our jurisdictions. The IT infrastructure, communications networks and meter data management systems that will enable the meters to be smart are being constructed. We are pleased with the progress we've made on AMI in each of our jurisdictions and the positive feedback we continue to receive from our stakeholders especially regarding the benefits and future opportunities this technology will provide for our customers. The investments we make in our core business also improve our environmental footprint. We have one of the cleanest generating fleets in the United States, and a principal objective is to remain an environmentally sustainable fleet for the communities we serve. The cornerstone of this objective began when we were the first U.S. utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing CO2 emissions in 2001. 
  10 years later, our commitment went beyond merely stabilizing CO2 emissions. In 2011, our Environment 2020 commitment included a voluntary pledge that through the year 2020, we would maintain our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels on a cumulative basis. I'm pleased to report that we are meeting our commitments and the investments we are making will enable us to continue to lower our emission rates at the utility. For example, highly efficient combined cycle power stations, such as St. Charles, Lake Charles and Montgomery County, will produce pure carbon emissions than the legacy units they replace, improve our average fleet efficiency and use less water.
Nuclear generation is also an important non-emitting baseload resource. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable assets is an important part of our strategy to deliver sustainable value to all of our stakeholders.
Our planned investments in new technologies to modernize our grid, such as advanced meters, will further improve efficiency. On top of that, our customers of all classes are interested in the deployment of renewable resources, and we are working to meet these expectations. To that end, over the next 3 years, we expect to contract for over 800 megawatts of renewable resources. Of these, approximately 180 megawatts are the 2 power purchase agreements in Arkansas that we have discussed with you on previous occasions. Of the remainder, approximately half represent ownership opportunities.
These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we are making today to develop an electric generating and delivery system that is well-positioned for operations in a carbon-constrained economy, whatever that may look like in the future.
Turning to EWC, we've taken important steps to provide a clear path to exit that business in 2022. We reached an agreement to cease operations of Indian Point in 2021 and submitted our deactivation notice to New York ISO. The ISO concluded there will be no reliability issues resulting from Indian Point's retirement. We sold FitzPatrick, preserving the plant's benefits for its employees and community, and we decided to continue to operate Palisades through the spring of 2022, a cash-positive decision. 
  
  Finally, in 2017, we received a number of awards that recognize our accomplishments, values and commitments. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index. We are named one of the top 10 utilities in economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Women's Business Enterprise National Council listed Entergy as one of America's top corporations for women's business enterprise. We are 1 of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and we received EEI's emergency recovery and emergency assistance awards for our storm-restorations efforts.
Our commitment to our communities is further evidenced by our charitable contributions, which total approximately $16 million annually, including investment in workforce development across our jurisdictions. Our employees and retirees are also generous with their time, volunteering some 100,000 hours annually.
All of our accomplishments and successes are the result of our employees' first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work every day. I want to thank the more than 13,000 men and women of Entergy for living by our values, working safely and acting with integrity. Their ideas and can do spirit make Entergy a better company.
Looking ahead, our 2018 plans support our financial outlooks as well as our aspirations for the future of our company. As I mentioned earlier, the foundation for success this year is largely in place and less dependent on strategic initiatives and on our own operational execution.
We'll be building projects that have already been approved, continuing with the annual MISO MTEP process in making regulatory filings in the normal course of business. 2 major transmission projects we will complete this year are the Lake Charles project noted earlier and the $130 million Southwest Mississippi improvement project. We look forward to their completion and the benefits that they will provide to our customers and to our region.
We will also complete AMI's core IT system implementations and initiate deployment of the communications network. This will support meter installations beginning early next year when customers will start to see the benefits this technology provides, giving them the ability to manage their usage and their bills.
Another important goal for 2018 is for ANO to exit Column 4. Over the past few years, we have worked with the NRC as well as our peers, and we have systematically completed the actions outlined in our confirmatory action letter. ANO is on track to return to normal oversight this year. 
  
  As for our regulatory agenda, we are working with each of our regulators on the effects of tax reform and we welcome the change for our customers. On an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate means that customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been. That's important to us as evidenced by the fact that our rates are among the lowest in the country. We plan to make rate filings in each of our jurisdictions this year, and we expect tax reform to be addressed in the normal course of those proceedings. We are also focused on efforts to address customer needs in unique ways. For example, in Mississippi, working with the Public Service Commission, we are teaming up with C Spire on a fiber infrastructure project. This project will span over 300 miles in 15 counties to bring next-generation broadband services to consumers and businesses in some of the most isolated and rural parts of the state. These services will open doors that were not previously available in those areas.
At EWC, we will remain focused on safe and reliable operations to finish strong in the last few years of operation. Regarding our VY Northstar transaction, we have made substantial progress towards finalizing an agreement then we filed a status update with the Vermont Public Utility Commission earlier this week. As the report states, the parties anticipate filing a memorandum of understanding by March 2. If some or all of the parties will join, the MOU will address financial assurances and site restoration standards. We still target closing the transaction by the end of 2018.
All of these plans support our guidance and are the foundation for our long-term outlooks, which we affirm today. Drew will provide additional color around our forward-looking commitments. 
  
  2017 has been another year of significant accomplishments for our company, accomplishments that will help provide the foundation for our pursuit of the much broader aspirations we have set for ourselves. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We are a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. For years, we've been committed to creating sustainable value for our owners, customers, employees and communities, a commitment that many investors are recognizing as essential to success over the long term. That has been reflected not only in the steps we have taken to exit the EWC business and strengthen the utility but also in our leadership position among utilities and critical measures of sustainability, including our recognition as an environmentally and socially responsible in utility. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. All of this prepares us to meet the challenges of an evolving industry. Over the next 3 years, we will continue to strengthen and deliver on our commitment to our stakeholders. We will place into service new, clean, efficient, generating resources; new transmission projects throughout our service territory; and, of course, AMI. AMI and its related technologies will serve as the foundation on which we plan to build the Entergy of tomorrow.
As new technologies, data and analytics continue to improve, so too will our ability to deliver tailored customer solutions that better meet our evolving customer expectations through a dynamic, integrated energy network and new products and services beyond basic power delivery. We want to be in a position to deliver the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for the future, a future that offers transformative change and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we are eager to lead the way.
Before I turn it over to Drew, I'm excited to announce that we will host our Analyst Day conference in New York City on June 21. Our main objective will be to give you a view of our 5-year outlook and our plan for operational execution. We will also continue the conversation on how we define our company beyond 5 years. Stay tuned for more details. 
  
  I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2017 financial results, the implications of tax reform for our company, 2018 guidance and our 3-year outlooks."

As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for us with significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished in the top half of our operational guidance range, exceeding our expectations for the year despite the negative effects of weather.
This is better than we told you to expect on our third quarter call primarily driven by 2 factors. First, at the Utility, we experienced strong sales growth led by our industrial sector, which came in at 7% quarter-over-quarter. Second, we saw benefits from our continued efforts to de-risk our EWC business. For Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we also ended above our expectations and above the top end of our guidance range due to the strong sales growth.
Beyond the financial results, we also know that tax reform is on your mind. Leo mentioned that new legislation will provide significant benefits to our customers. Over time, we'll return approximately $1.4 billion for the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT, in one form or another, whether through customer refunds, cash investments and new assets, accelerated depreciation or other options our regulators may consider. And on an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate will translate into lower bills than our customers would have otherwise. In addition, our 2018 guidance and the longer-term outlook we're affirming today include expectations for the effective tax reform.
I'll now turn to some of the drivers for our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our core business, Utility, Parent & Other, on Slide 6.
On an adjusted view, earnings were $0.21 higher than fourth quarter 2016, driven by strong sales growth. For the industrial class, we saw robust sales from existing customers, largely from the chlor-alkali and primary metal sectors as well as new and expansion customers. We also recorded nonrecurring regulatory charges totaling $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2016. Higher non-fuel O&M partially offset these benefits, primarily due to higher nuclear spending as we continue to drive our nuclear strategic plan.
At EWC, on Slide 7, operational earnings increased $0.39 quarter-over-quarter. FitzPatrick contributed an $0.11 loss to fourth quarter 2016 results and the sale of that plant in 2017 affected variances from multiple line items.
Excluding the effect of FitzPatrick, earnings increased to $0.28 due largely to higher income from realized earnings on decommissioning trust, which we highlighted as an opportunity on our third quarter call.
Strong market performance increased trust value to a level where we locked in gains by rebalancing some of the trust investment towards lower-volatility fixed-income instruments.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $911 million, approximately $165 million higher than a year ago. The increase is primarily due to collections of fuel and purchased power cost at Utility.
Now turning to the full year on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2017 were $7.20 per share, higher than the $7.11 in 2016. It was also above our guidance midpoint despite negative weather and better than our expectations in October. As I mentioned, drivers for the change versus our expectation included strong sales growth at the Utility and higher realized earnings on decommissioned trust. 
  
  Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.50 in 2017, $0.18 higher than 2016. The increase is due largely to rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit our customers as well as residential, commercial and industrial weather-adjusted sales growth. This increase is partly offset by higher spending on nuclear operations and other operating expenses.
Slide 11 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which increased year-over-year to $3.24 per share in 2017 from $2.01 in 2016. Excluding FitzPatrick, this increase was due largely to income tax items and as previously mentioned, higher realized gains on decommissioning trust funds. 2017 results also reflected higher decommissioning expense primarily from the establishment of decommissioning liabilities at Indian Point 3 in August 2016.
Full year 2017 operating cash flow, shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2017, $375 million lower than last year. Higher refueling outage cost as we completed 7 refueling outages this year at both the merchant and the utility fleet, unfavorable weather at utility and lower EWC net revenue were the main drivers.
Today, we are issuing our 2018 consolidated operational EPS guidance of $6.25 to $6.85 and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance of $4.50 to $4.90.
On Slide 13, starting with Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, our range is consistent with the outlook we presented at the EEI conference last November. Walking through a few of the key drivers, let's start with the top line.
Our projected sales volume in 2018 is largely unchanged from our view at EEI, and our guidance reflects a slight decline year-over-year. However, we expect volatility from quarter to quarter. For example, we expect industrial sales growth in the first quarter as new customers become fully operational, but we expect sales declines over the remainder of the year as existing customers return to normal operation and take maintenance outages following strong performance in 2017. Despite the tempered outlook for our industrial sales growth in 2018, we see growth resuming in 2019 and 2020 as new projects come online.
We are projecting nonfuel O&M to be approximately $2.6 billion, which represents a slight increase compared to 2017. This reflects slightly higher pension expense due to a pension discount rate assumption of 3.78%, which is lower than our previous expectation.
Return of excess ADIT affects the top line but is essentially offset in income tax expense. 2018 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at Utility, Parent & Other.
Additionally, as a result of tax reform at Parent & Other, we'll see a lower tax yield on that segment's loss. We also expect higher financing cost. At the Utility, the tax change will affect each operating company differently, and we expect a more significant impact to be in Entergy Arkansas. Because of the mechanics of the FRP, Entergy Arkansas can earn closer to its allowed return in 2018. This is a key driver that helps offset the negative drag at Parent this year.
At EWC, we expect earnings to decline in 2018 largely due to income tax planning items. As you recall, in second quarter 2017, EWC recorded an income tax benefit contributing $373 million to operational earnings. This year, we are assuming that EWC will record another tax benefit currently estimated to be approximately $100 million. In addition, we expect lower net revenue, largely due to lower energy prices and higher nonfuel O&M due to higher projected nuclear spending, partly due to the decision to operate Palisades until 2022. These decreases are offset by lower depreciation expense, also due to the Palisades decision, and higher earnings on decommissioning trust due to the change in accounting rules that require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market.
Right now, our guidance reflects a return assumption of 6.25%, which equates to approximately $1 in earnings per share. We also expect lower income tax expense due to the lower income tax rate.
Before we leave EWC, I'll give a quick update on our cash position. We now see neutral to positive cash flow from EWC to Parent from 2017 to 2022, and this includes our current view on potential decommissioning trust contributions. This is slightly better than last quarter due to locking in strong nuclear decommissioning trust returns and continued strategies to mitigate nuclear decommissioning costs.
Tax reform will also affect our cash needs. And as shown on Slide 14, we will require incremental financing. The 2 primary needs are from: first, the return of excess deferred taxes; and second, lower tax expense and rates. We expect to finance this reduction through a combination of utility company debt, parent debt, internal cash generation and external equity. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period. And currently, we expect that all to occur before the end of 2019. 
  
  Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 15, our earnings expectations continue to firm up as we execute on key deliverables. Our outlook through 2020 is unchanged, despite the Parent drag that I previously noted. That's in part because we will see increased rate base as we return excess ADIT to customers over time. Also, before tax reform, we were trending at the upper end of our ranges in '19 and '20. Collectively, these allow us to maintain our outlooks. While I don't normally talk about where in these outlooks we see ourselves, given the significant changes in tax reform, you should know that we do not see ourselves at the bottom of the ranges. Of course, these are our current expectations but ultimately the amount and timing of earnings and cash impacts from tax reform will depend on the regulatory treatment. All of our jurisdictions have opened a docket in one form or another, and rate-making regulatory proceedings are scheduled this year in each of our jurisdictions.
We will work with our regulators through these proceedings to address the effects of tax reform and develop the appropriate path forward so that this opportunity gets value to our customers as fast as possible, but also provide all of our Entergy stakeholders with a fair and reasonable outcome.
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 16. The reduction in cash from tax reform will also put pressure on our FFO to debt credit metric. Even though this metric would be adversely affected, we are focused on maintaining the financial integrity of the utilities credit profile by internally identifying the opportunities to improve cash flow and externally working with our retail regulators. Throughout, we expect to continue to hold an investment-grade rating. 
  
  As I mentioned earlier, 2017 was another strong year of results and we look forward to 2018.

[indiscernible] we executed on our key 2017 deliverables. At the Utility, we had an active regulatory calendar, and we continued to gain certainty from major product -- projects in our capital plan. We received approval to build 2 new highly efficient gas-fired-generating resources. All of our jurisdictions approved our plans to implement AMI in their respective service areas. 
For transmission, we completed another MTEP cycle. We made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station. We completed 3 annual formula rate plans in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and we implemented 2 cost recovery factor increases in Texas. We are in discussions to extend Entergy Louisiana's annual FRP. We continued along the path to continued clarity on our exit from the merchant business in 2022, and we raised our dividend for the third consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue subject, as always, to board approval.
Our accomplishments this year are simply a continuation of the path we set several years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders. We set out to be a company that delivers strong financial results to its owners, invests in its employees to create a workforce for the future, and is an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for its communities while maintaining some of the lowest rates in the country for customers.
Our key deliverables support this aspiration for our company. As we look ahead to 2018 and our 3-year outlook period, our success is less dependent on strategic initiatives and more on our own operational execution. As a result, today, we are initiating 2018 guidance consistent with our previous disclosures, and we are affirming our Utility, Parent & Other longer-term outlook through 2020. Beyond that, we continue to see a good path for steady, predictable growth at our core business as we continue to modernize our infrastructure. We are laying the foundation now to be the sustainable solutions-oriented utility of the future that provides customer-focused innovation in a changing world.
Shifting now to 2017, let's review some details behind our key accomplishments that keep us on track to attain both our near-term goals and our longer-term aspirations.
On the regulatory front, we successfully completed Entergy Arkansas' second forward test year FRP, with rates effective last month. The commission approved our comprehensive settlement agreement, which, among other matters, verified the prudence of the nuclear costs included in the 2017 and 2018 test year filings. 
Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to extend its formula rate plan for another 3 years. While the settlement talks have slowed to ensure parties understand the implications of tax reform, discussions have been productive and are ongoing.
With respect to our large generation projects, we received approval to build the Lake Charles and Montgomery County Power Stations. With the St. Charles Power Station, these projects are an important part of our investment plan to modernize the electric grid and improve reliability. All 3 are on schedule and we are confident and successful, on-time and on-budget execution. We've also made significant progress in the certification of the New Orleans Power Station with the Council Utility Committee's approval of the project earlier this week. We expect the full council to take up the certification for a final decision on March 8.
  We also made strides in transmission. We invested approximately $1 billion and placed more than $900 million of capital projects into service. We also made significant progress on the Lake Charles Transmission Project. This is our largest transmission endeavored to-date, and it includes 30 miles of extra-high-voltage transmission line and addresses reliability needs, driven in part by load growth in Southwest Louisiana. We expect to complete the project in second quarter 2018. We wrapped up the 2017 MTEP review and MISO approved 70 projects in our service area, totaling approximately $1 billion. 
  
  Regarding the growth and transformation of our distribution system, we have now received regulatory approvals for the deployment of advanced meters in all of our jurisdictions. The IT infrastructure, communications networks and meter data management systems that will enable the meters to be smart are being constructed. We are pleased with the progress we've made on AMI in each of our jurisdictions and the positive feedback we continue to receive from our stakeholders especially regarding the benefits and future opportunities this technology will provide for our customers. The investments we make in our core business also improve our environmental footprint. We have one of the cleanest generating fleets in the United States, and a principal objective is to remain an environmentally sustainable fleet for the communities we serve. The cornerstone of this objective began when we were the first U.S. utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing CO2 emissions in 2001. 
  10 years later, our commitment went beyond merely stabilizing CO2 emissions. In 2011, our Environment 2020 commitment included a voluntary pledge that through the year 2020, we would maintain our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels on a cumulative basis. I'm pleased to report that we are meeting our commitments and the investments we are making will enable us to continue to lower our emission rates at the utility. For example, highly efficient combined cycle power stations, such as St. Charles, Lake Charles and Montgomery County, will produce pure carbon emissions than the legacy units they replace, improve our average fleet efficiency and use less water.
Nuclear generation is also an important non-emitting baseload resource. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable assets is an important part of our strategy to deliver sustainable value to all of our stakeholders.
Our planned investments in new technologies to modernize our grid, such as advanced meters, will further improve efficiency. On top of that, our customers of all classes are interested in the deployment of renewable resources, and we are working to meet these expectations. To that end, over the next 3 years, we expect to contract for over 800 megawatts of renewable resources. Of these, approximately 180 megawatts are the 2 power purchase agreements in Arkansas that we have discussed with you on previous occasions. Of the remainder, approximately half represent ownership opportunities.
These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we are making today to develop an electric generating and delivery system that is well-positioned for operations in a carbon-constrained economy, whatever that may look like in the future.
Turning to EWC, we've taken important steps to provide a clear path to exit that business in 2022. We reached an agreement to cease operations of Indian Point in 2021 and submitted our deactivation notice to New York ISO. The ISO concluded there will be no reliability issues resulting from Indian Point's retirement. We sold FitzPatrick, preserving the plant's benefits for its employees and community, and we decided to continue to operate Palisades through the spring of 2022, a cash-positive decision. 
  
  Finally, in 2017, we received a number of awards that recognize our accomplishments, values and commitments. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index. We are named one of the top 10 utilities in economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Women's Business Enterprise National Council listed Entergy as one of America's top corporations for women's business enterprise. We are 1 of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and we received EEI's emergency recovery and emergency assistance awards for our storm-restorations efforts.
Our commitment to our communities is further evidenced by our charitable contributions, which total approximately $16 million annually, including investment in workforce development across our jurisdictions. Our employees and retirees are also generous with their time, volunteering some 100,000 hours annually.
All of our accomplishments and successes are the result of our employees' first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work every day. I want to thank the more than 13,000 men and women of Entergy for living by our values, working safely and acting with integrity. Their ideas and can do spirit make Entergy a better company.
Looking ahead, our 2018 plans support our financial outlooks as well as our aspirations for the future of our company. As I mentioned earlier, the foundation for success this year is largely in place and less dependent on strategic initiatives and on our own operational execution.
We'll be building projects that have already been approved, continuing with the annual MISO MTEP process in making regulatory filings in the normal course of business. 2 major transmission projects we will complete this year are the Lake Charles project noted earlier and the $130 million Southwest Mississippi improvement project. We look forward to their completion and the benefits that they will provide to our customers and to our region.
We will also complete AMI's core IT system implementations and initiate deployment of the communications network. This will support meter installations beginning early next year when customers will start to see the benefits this technology provides, giving them the ability to manage their usage and their bills.
Another important goal for 2018 is for ANO to exit Column 4. Over the past few years, we have worked with the NRC as well as our peers, and we have systematically completed the actions outlined in our confirmatory action letter. ANO is on track to return to normal oversight this year. 
  
  As for our regulatory agenda, we are working with each of our regulators on the effects of tax reform and we welcome the change for our customers. On an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate means that customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been. That's important to us as evidenced by the fact that our rates are among the lowest in the country. We plan to make rate filings in each of our jurisdictions this year, and we expect tax reform to be addressed in the normal course of those proceedings. We are also focused on efforts to address customer needs in unique ways. For example, in Mississippi, working with the Public Service Commission, we are teaming up with C Spire on a fiber infrastructure project. This project will span over 300 miles in 15 counties to bring next-generation broadband services to consumers and businesses in some of the most isolated and rural parts of the state. These services will open doors that were not previously available in those areas.
At EWC, we will remain focused on safe and reliable operations to finish strong in the last few years of operation. Regarding our VY Northstar transaction, we have made substantial progress towards finalizing an agreement then we filed a status update with the Vermont Public Utility Commission earlier this week. As the report states, the parties anticipate filing a memorandum of understanding by March 2. If some or all of the parties will join, the MOU will address financial assurances and site restoration standards. We still target closing the transaction by the end of 2018.
All of these plans support our guidance and are the foundation for our long-term outlooks, which we affirm today. Drew will provide additional color around our forward-looking commitments. 
  
  2017 has been another year of significant accomplishments for our company, accomplishments that will help provide the foundation for our pursuit of the much broader aspirations we have set for ourselves. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We are a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. For years, we've been committed to creating sustainable value for our owners, customers, employees and communities, a commitment that many investors are recognizing as essential to success over the long term. That has been reflected not only in the steps we have taken to exit the EWC business and strengthen the utility but also in our leadership position among utilities and critical measures of sustainability, including our recognition as an environmentally and socially responsible in utility. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. All of this prepares us to meet the challenges of an evolving industry. Over the next 3 years, we will continue to strengthen and deliver on our commitment to our stakeholders. We will place into service new, clean, efficient, generating resources; new transmission projects throughout our service territory; and, of course, AMI. AMI and its related technologies will serve as the foundation on which we plan to build the Entergy of tomorrow.
As new technologies, data and analytics continue to improve, so too will our ability to deliver tailored customer solutions that better meet our evolving customer expectations through a dynamic, integrated energy network and new products and services beyond basic power delivery. We want to be in a position to deliver the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for the future, a future that offers transformative change and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we are eager to lead the way.
Before I turn it over to Drew, I'm excited to announce that we will host our Analyst Day conference in New York City on June 21. Our main objective will be to give you a view of our 5-year outlook and our plan for operational execution. We will also continue the conversation on how we define our company beyond 5 years. Stay tuned for more details. 
  
  I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2017 financial results, the implications of tax reform for our company, 2018 guidance and our 3-year outlooks."
269764,550124810,1401713,"Entergy Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2018",2018-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for us with significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished in the top half of our operational guidance range, ex",1718,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, 2017 was another productive year for us with significant accomplishments. Before we get into the details, for Entergy consolidated, we finished in the top half of our operational guidance range, exceeding our expectations for the year despite the negative effects of weather.
This is better than we told you to expect on our third quarter call primarily driven by 2 factors. First, at the Utility, we experienced strong sales growth led by our industrial sector, which came in at 7% quarter-over-quarter. Second, we saw benefits from our continued efforts to de-risk our EWC business. For Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we also ended above our expectations and above the top end of our guidance range due to the strong sales growth.
Beyond the financial results, we also know that tax reform is on your mind. Leo mentioned that new legislation will provide significant benefits to our customers. Over time, we'll return approximately $1.4 billion for the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT, in one form or another, whether through customer refunds, cash investments and new assets, accelerated depreciation or other options our regulators may consider. And on an ongoing basis, the lower tax rate will translate into lower bills than our customers would have otherwise. In addition, our 2018 guidance and the longer-term outlook we're affirming today include expectations for the effective tax reform.
I'll now turn to some of the drivers for our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our core business, Utility, Parent & Other, on Slide 6.
On an adjusted view, earnings were $0.21 higher than fourth quarter 2016, driven by strong sales growth. For the industrial class, we saw robust sales from existing customers, largely from the chlor-alkali and primary metal sectors as well as new and expansion customers. We also recorded nonrecurring regulatory charges totaling $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2016. Higher non-fuel O&M partially offset these benefits, primarily due to higher nuclear spending as we continue to drive our nuclear strategic plan.
At EWC, on Slide 7, operational earnings increased $0.39 quarter-over-quarter. FitzPatrick contributed an $0.11 loss to fourth quarter 2016 results and the sale of that plant in 2017 affected variances from multiple line items.
Excluding the effect of FitzPatrick, earnings increased to $0.28 due largely to higher income from realized earnings on decommissioning trust, which we highlighted as an opportunity on our third quarter call.
Strong market performance increased trust value to a level where we locked in gains by rebalancing some of the trust investment towards lower-volatility fixed-income instruments.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $911 million, approximately $165 million higher than a year ago. The increase is primarily due to collections of fuel and purchased power cost at Utility.
Now turning to the full year on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2017 were $7.20 per share, higher than the $7.11 in 2016. It was also above our guidance midpoint despite negative weather and better than our expectations in October. As I mentioned, drivers for the change versus our expectation included strong sales growth at the Utility and higher realized earnings on decommissioned trust. 
  
  Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.50 in 2017, $0.18 higher than 2016. The increase is due largely to rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit our customers as well as residential, commercial and industrial weather-adjusted sales growth. This increase is partly offset by higher spending on nuclear operations and other operating expenses.
Slide 11 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which increased year-over-year to $3.24 per share in 2017 from $2.01 in 2016. Excluding FitzPatrick, this increase was due largely to income tax items and as previously mentioned, higher realized gains on decommissioning trust funds. 2017 results also reflected higher decommissioning expense primarily from the establishment of decommissioning liabilities at Indian Point 3 in August 2016.
Full year 2017 operating cash flow, shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2017, $375 million lower than last year. Higher refueling outage cost as we completed 7 refueling outages this year at both the merchant and the utility fleet, unfavorable weather at utility and lower EWC net revenue were the main drivers.
Today, we are issuing our 2018 consolidated operational EPS guidance of $6.25 to $6.85 and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance of $4.50 to $4.90.
On Slide 13, starting with Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, our range is consistent with the outlook we presented at the EEI conference last November. Walking through a few of the key drivers, let's start with the top line.
Our projected sales volume in 2018 is largely unchanged from our view at EEI, and our guidance reflects a slight decline year-over-year. However, we expect volatility from quarter to quarter. For example, we expect industrial sales growth in the first quarter as new customers become fully operational, but we expect sales declines over the remainder of the year as existing customers return to normal operation and take maintenance outages following strong performance in 2017. Despite the tempered outlook for our industrial sales growth in 2018, we see growth resuming in 2019 and 2020 as new projects come online.
We are projecting nonfuel O&M to be approximately $2.6 billion, which represents a slight increase compared to 2017. This reflects slightly higher pension expense due to a pension discount rate assumption of 3.78%, which is lower than our previous expectation.
Return of excess ADIT affects the top line but is essentially offset in income tax expense. 2018 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at Utility, Parent & Other.
Additionally, as a result of tax reform at Parent & Other, we'll see a lower tax yield on that segment's loss. We also expect higher financing cost. At the Utility, the tax change will affect each operating company differently, and we expect a more significant impact to be in Entergy Arkansas. Because of the mechanics of the FRP, Entergy Arkansas can earn closer to its allowed return in 2018. This is a key driver that helps offset the negative drag at Parent this year.
At EWC, we expect earnings to decline in 2018 largely due to income tax planning items. As you recall, in second quarter 2017, EWC recorded an income tax benefit contributing $373 million to operational earnings. This year, we are assuming that EWC will record another tax benefit currently estimated to be approximately $100 million. In addition, we expect lower net revenue, largely due to lower energy prices and higher nonfuel O&M due to higher projected nuclear spending, partly due to the decision to operate Palisades until 2022. These decreases are offset by lower depreciation expense, also due to the Palisades decision, and higher earnings on decommissioning trust due to the change in accounting rules that require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market.
Right now, our guidance reflects a return assumption of 6.25%, which equates to approximately $1 in earnings per share. We also expect lower income tax expense due to the lower income tax rate.
Before we leave EWC, I'll give a quick update on our cash position. We now see neutral to positive cash flow from EWC to Parent from 2017 to 2022, and this includes our current view on potential decommissioning trust contributions. This is slightly better than last quarter due to locking in strong nuclear decommissioning trust returns and continued strategies to mitigate nuclear decommissioning costs.
Tax reform will also affect our cash needs. And as shown on Slide 14, we will require incremental financing. The 2 primary needs are from: first, the return of excess deferred taxes; and second, lower tax expense and rates. We expect to finance this reduction through a combination of utility company debt, parent debt, internal cash generation and external equity. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period. And currently, we expect that all to occur before the end of 2019. 
  
  Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 15, our earnings expectations continue to firm up as we execute on key deliverables. Our outlook through 2020 is unchanged, despite the Parent drag that I previously noted. That's in part because we will see increased rate base as we return excess ADIT to customers over time. Also, before tax reform, we were trending at the upper end of our ranges in '19 and '20. Collectively, these allow us to maintain our outlooks. While I don't normally talk about where in these outlooks we see ourselves, given the significant changes in tax reform, you should know that we do not see ourselves at the bottom of the ranges. Of course, these are our current expectations but ultimately the amount and timing of earnings and cash impacts from tax reform will depend on the regulatory treatment. All of our jurisdictions have opened a docket in one form or another, and rate-making regulatory proceedings are scheduled this year in each of our jurisdictions.
We will work with our regulators through these proceedings to address the effects of tax reform and develop the appropriate path forward so that this opportunity gets value to our customers as fast as possible, but also provide all of our Entergy stakeholders with a fair and reasonable outcome.
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 16. The reduction in cash from tax reform will also put pressure on our FFO to debt credit metric. Even though this metric would be adversely affected, we are focused on maintaining the financial integrity of the utilities credit profile by internally identifying the opportunities to improve cash flow and externally working with our retail regulators. Throughout, we expect to continue to hold an investment-grade rating. 
  
  As I mentioned earlier, 2017 was another strong year of results and we look forward to 2018. The foundation for success this year is largely in place as we focus on building projects that have already been approved, advance our operational capabilities, work with our regulators to implement appropriate changes in light of tax reform and prepare for the customer-centered and opportunity-filled future that Leo described in his remarks.

Today, we are reporting a solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in more detail, but the bottom-line is that this quarter's results keep us on track to achieve our full year UP&O adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlooks.
This first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we executed operationally with success on key projects and regulatory initiatives. The quarter's accomplishments continue our strategic execution on key deliverables dating back to the first quarter of 2015 when we initiated the concepts of our quarterly to-do list. That's 13 consecutive quarters where we've met essentially every goal we set out as critical to our broader overall strategy.  Some of our goals were ambitious but we are confident that we had the organization, focus and commitment to succeed. Our progress this quarter is an extension of those efforts. 
Specifically, we continue to move forward with our new build generation projects. The New Orleans Power Station was officially approved and we've issued full notice to proceed with the engineering procurement and construction contractor. This 128 megawatts reciprocating internal combustion engine facility will provide significant reliability and cost benefits to customers, and it will be the only large-scale generation located within the city of New Orleans. The flexible design of this facility will also make it well suited to support intermittent renewable resources like solar.
The Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also underway. The EPC contractor has been released to start engineering and order major equipment and this summer, we will issue a full notice to proceed on that project. 
As for the St. Charles and Lake Charles Power Stations, construction advances on both projects. All the major equipment is in place for St. Charles, and Lake Charles is well into its engineering and procurement phases and moving forward with its construction phase. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on these important resources, all of which are proceeding on schedule and on budget. 
For Washington Parish Energy Center, we have reached an unopposed agreement in principal, and we'll be preparing settlement documents and filing to present the Louisiana -- to the Louisiana Commission. We expect to present the filing in time for the LPSC consideration this summer.
We are also planning for the future of our power generation organization. We recently announced a partnership with River Parishes Community College to open a power generation training center on the college's campus in Gonzales, Louisiana. We expect to send up to 400 employees each year for training at this center.
We've made significant progress on key transmission projects that will improve reliability, support growth and lower costs for our customers. Our Lake Charles Transmission Project is our largest transmission undertaking ever, and it will provide improved reliability and additional load-serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth. The major components have been completed, with portions now placed in service and already benefiting customers. 
We also completed large projects in Southeast Louisiana and Mississippi that are already providing reliability benefits to customers in those areas, and we are developing and constructing several large projects in Texas.
In addition, the transmission employees achieves over 1 million hours without a recordable accident. It's just over 210 days through the end of the quarter, setting a record for the transmission organization. I applaud our employees for reaching this milestone and their continued diligence and focus on safety.
We are approximately 60% complete with the buildout of the IT systems required to support advanced meter deployment. We are working to complete those systems and finalize meter and communication network development plans as well as customer education plans. The AMI project remains on track to begin meter installations in 2019. These advanced meters will provide significant benefits to our customers and lay the foundation for the next generation of grid technology investments for our system.
On the regulatory front, Louisiana Public Service Commission approved our unopposed settlement agreement for Entergy Louisiana's annual formula rate plan through 2020. This is a good outcome and another step towards ensuring that we have progress an efficient recovery mechanisms in our jurisdictions. This settlement was a result of another constructive, collaborative effort among all the stakeholder groups, and gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest into the reliability of our infrastructure for the benefit of our customers.
As part of the settlement, we will reset rates to a 9.95% ROE in 2018, and our customers will receive the benefits of the lower income tax rate. The settlement also includes a provision for the return of more than $200 million to customers for unprotected excess [ ADIT ]. Half of that will be returned this year and the remainder over the next 4 years. The FRP now has a new transmission rider that will help ensure more timely recovery of Entergy Louisiana transmission investment. The overall framework also includes other refinements that we believe will position us to earn our allowed return in Louisiana during the FRP period. We will submit our first filing of the FRP by the end of June for rates to be affected in September of this year.
And finally, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual FRP in March. Because of the effects of the lower federal tax rate, we requested no change in base rates. The FRP filing also includes our proposal to return unprotected excess ADIP. Under our proposal, Mississippi customers will receive a bill credits of this year totaling approximately $80 million, and the remaining balance will be used to recover certain items on Entergy Mississippi's balance sheet that otherwise would be in rates. 
Of course, as we execute on our investment plan, we remain focused on customer builds. Today, we already have some of the lowest retail rates in the country. Going forward, the lower federal tax rate, the rolloff of securitizations, continued industrial growth and the deployment of AMI are all important drivers that will help keep our rates low for the benefit of our customers.
Also during the quarter, Entergy Louisiana signed a 10-year agreement with UN Chemicals to supply power to our new methanol facility. ICI is investing $1.5 billion in the construction of its methanol plant, which is scheduled to be completed by first quarter of 2020. This project is just another example of the continuing economic development opportunities in our service areas. We are proud of our contribution to these efforts, as these type of projects are critical to the well-being of the communities we serve. 
Our economic development teams are actively engaged with existing customers and prospects, Site Selection consultants, state agencies and local economic development organizations to bring more industrial growth opportunities to our region. And we continue to see strong interest, supported by a favorable business and economic environment.  For example, we expect the oil and gas racial to sustain a competitive levels, which improves customer economics in the petrochemical value chain. In addition, LNG markets are absorbing incremental supply at a fairly rapid pace, and the market is poised to meet additional liquefaction capacity by early 2020. 
Impending international maritime organization will solve for marine fuels starting in 2020, the high sulfur fuel that will no longer be suitable for in ships will require secondary processes to further refine the products to meet the new standards just to create an economic opportunity for refiners to incrementally expand the secondary processing units, such as hydro crackers. Overall, the indicators that have led to continued industrial sales growth in our service territory are still trending in a positive direction.
At our merchant business, we continue to focus on safety and risk mitigation as we steadily move towards the end of operations. We reached a settlement agreement for the sale of Vermont Yankee to Northstar, evidentiary hearings will be held in May, and we've requested a decision from the Vermont public utility commission in July. That transaction will also require approval from the NRC, and we continue to expect a decision in the third quarter.
With respect to Indian Point, we have received determinations from the New York ISO that iPAQ's retirement will not create any reliability concerns nor will it raise any market power issues. We are on track to retire the units as scheduled. We recently wrap up our last refueling outage of unit 2, and that unit is now in its final operating cycle. The outage was completed within our schedule and budget. Indian Point 2 has been an important asset for Entergy and the communities it serves and supports. I would like to acknowledge the work of all of our employees at the plant over the years and their commitment to finish strong.
On April 2, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began its final quarterly inspection of ANO's confirmatory action letter progress. A few remaining items are being addressed in ANO's current refueling outage, and all are expected to be satisfactorily closed to support closure of the confirmatory action letter this June. As a result, we are on track for ANO to exit column 4 and return to normal oversight by the end of the second quarter.
At Grand Gulf, we are all also entering fuel outage oil, where we are working on a number of important maintenance projects and equipment upgrades. In combination with both the thorough review of processes, procedures and protocols we conducted at the plant and the more than 3,100 hours of training operations and maintenance of the crews underwent in the past 18 months, we expect the reliability with the plant and its capability factor to improve going forward.
I'd also like to acknowledge a few awards and recognitions that we've received so far this year. Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi received will 2018 Energy Star Awards for their outstanding efforts to promote energy efficiency and educate customers. Entergy was named for the third consecutive year by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to the list of America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises. Beyond recognized this corporation that have implemented world-class policies and programs to enabled growth and reduce various for women in our business. In the Louisiana Society for Human Resource Management also awarded Entergy its 2018 Excellence and Diversity award, recognizing the impact we've made fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture.
As a reminder, we recently released our 2017 integrated report entitled Utility Reimagine, where we discussed in detail the many ways we are creating sustainable value for all 4 of our stakeholders. We've increased our environmental social and government's disclosures, and in particular, we've adopted the Edison Electric Institute's ESG template as part of our integrated report. 
In a continued effort to provide you with relevant information, we are also reviewing and assessing evolving best practices on a 2-degree scenario analysis, including the newly published series framework for U.S. utilities with a view towards preparing a 2-degree scenario analysis that would likely be published either as part of or concurrently with our 2018 integrated report.
We also remain focused on continuing to reduce our carbon footprint. Our efforts began nearly 2 decades ago when we were the first U.S. utility to voluntarily stabilize CO2 emissions. We are working to expand our portfolio of renewable resources in ways that complement our existing resources and capabilities while maintaining our low customer rates. On our fourth quarter call in February, we mentioned that we are pursuing over 800 megawatts of renewables. Since then, we have identified new opportunities, and we are now evaluating more than 1,000 megawatts of renewables. Some of these projects have been announced while others are still in confidential discussions.
As renewable resources continue to become increasingly efficient and cost competitive, we plan to take further advantage of these opportunities. Increasing our use of renewables is one way for us to meet customer energy needs and expectations. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize the utility industry is a mix of change. We are planning for the long-term future of the company and are laying the foundation to provide innovative customer solutions in a changing world.
To further enhance our focus on this commitment, we've assembled a cross-functional team of employees led by our newly-created leadership position who reports directly to me. This team is dedicated to developing ideas about evaluating opportunities and ability action plans to meet the demands of our rapidly evolving industry, and are working to identify solutions that leverage technology such as data analytics, automation, distributed generation, utility and community steel, solar, microgrids, battery storage, electric vehicles, and other emerging technologies, all while keeping in mind as we always do, our most impoverished customers and the environment.
Finally, earlier this year, we welcomed John Sberbank to our Board of Directors. John a strong experience in developing and executing strategies for customer-facing businesses that are dealing with transformational change. He also has expertise in digital technology, customer data analytics and product development. All of this makes John uniquely suited to help us take advantage of innovations to may meet ever-evolving customer expect patients.
As I said at the outset, we had a solid to start to 2018, starts to keep us on our path for continued sustainable growth in our core business. We're well positioned for continued success in delivering on our commitments to. We are excited by this journey, and we look forward to talking to you more at our Analyst Day on June 21. I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and a bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlook.
Let's get straight to the numbers. Overall, operational earnings for Entergy consolidated increased $0.17 quarter-over-quarter. Drivers included the lower tax rate, favorable weather as well as the unfavorable effects from the implementation of ASU 2016/01 on our new [indiscernible] trust funds to EWC. 
Then we drill down on the different segments, starting with our core Utility, Parent & Other business on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings were $0.12 lower than the prior year due to a few key drivers.
Despite strong weather-adjusted sales growth and positive rate actions in both Arkansas and Texas, unbilled sales volume were lower. We also regulatory provisions at both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to reflect regulatory agreements regarding implementation of the effective tax reform. Combined, these drivers resulted in a decrease.
Non-fuel O&M was higher, largely from nuclear expenses, including nuclear payroll, which has increased as we continue to ramp up staffing pursuant to our plan. We don't expect nuclear to be a significant driver year. In addition, because ongoing capital investment in our core business, we naturally see increases in ad valorem and franchise taxes, which are partly offset by an increased AFUDC. And finally, the quarter reflected the lower federal tax rate.
Even though our UPO-adjusted results were lower quarter-over-quarter, our expectations for the full year have not changed. We remain on track to meet our 2018 guidance through a combination of factors that will benefit us in the second half of the year, including rate actions and O&M timing. Rate actions included an expectation for the recently approved Entergy Louisiana FRP. As Leo mentioned, this is a good outcome for our customers and all of our other stakeholders, and will position Entergy Louisiana to earn its elaborate returns during the FRP period. As you know, Louisiana is our largest jurisdiction, and we're happy with the collaborative effort from all stakeholders to reach this agreement. 
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 6.  Operational earnings were $0.33, approximately $0.04 lower than the prior year. Excluding FitzPatrick, the key driver for EWC was the weak mlt performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear recommissioning trust fund. Changes in accounting rules now require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market, but this doesn't change from our view of the long-term value of the funds, our anticipated cash flows from EWC, or efforts towards commercial resolution of the EWC business. The balance of the trust as of March 31 was approximately $4 billion. And the key value driver for the decommissioning is identifying economies of scale and engineering solutions that can reduce the ultimate costs. We're aggressively pursuing these types of solutions. 
Lower income tax expenditures and reductions of the federal tax rate, combined with the change in pretax income, partly offset the overall operational earnings decline.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of [ $557 million ] a slight increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower to the outer spending as well as the effect of favorable weather, partially offset by lower net revenue at EWC. 
Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term UP&O adjusted outlook, which are summarized on Slide 8 and 9. For our consolidated operational guidance, the unfavorable UPO decommissioning trust returns in the first quarter were lower than our planning assumption. But still early in the year, we're working on various opportunities on both utility and EWC. We're confident that we can overcome first quarter headwinds by the end of the year. 
Also, as a reminder, our guidance assumes $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we currently expect to materialize in the third quarter of this year.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the impact of tax reform will start to affect these metrics in the next few quarters. We continue to make good progress on tax reform in our jurisdiction. The dialogue with our regulators is constructed, and we are optimistic that we received approvals to return the unprotected portion of the excess AVIT sooner than we originally anticipated. All this will temporarily put additional pressure on our credit metrics. We recognition the value of returning the benefits to our customers sooner rather than later. Resolving uncertainty tax reform will be implemented in growing our net rate base back faster. This should also accelerate the recovery of our credit metrics. In short, our plan continues to shape up for better to maintain our current credit rating at BBB+ and BAA2. Our plan is to include issuing approximately $1 billion of our equity over our outlook period, and we still expect that to occur before the end of 2019. The form of equity that we issue, the timing of any issuance and the method by which we choose to execute are all under consideration, and the priority of maintaining connectivity to optimize the execution. 
In summary, before I turn to Analyst Day, it is a solid start of the year. Our results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance and outlook through 2020, continue to strengthen our business risk profile, and position us better to maintain our current credit rating. 
Now let's look beyond 2020, which we will discuss in greater detail at Analyst Day. We see no shortage of investment opportunities to sustain our growth beyond our current outlook period. Investment opportunities to build on the strong foundation we've established in the past few years, which we continue to solidify. From the new, clean, efficient innovative generation resources to grid technologies, such as smart devices, distributed generation, microgrid and battery storage, there is significant investment opportunity to deliver tailored solutions to meet our customers' rapidly-changing expectations. Because of the pace of change that we are anticipating, financial agility will be increasingly important, and that means maintaining or even improving our strong balance sheet. Therefore, at Analyst Day, we will lay out the financing plan that needs our earnings and credit objectives.
We see great opportunities ahead for our company and all our stakeholders. As Leo mentioned, in the future, we want to deliver tailored customer solutions beyond basic power delivery, and provide the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for our customers. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day to continue this dialogue. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And your first question about the drivers, I think is just the -- it's the accounting change that reflected the equity markets over the course of the quarter. And of course, so last year, we did not have to mark-to-market the equity piece. We only saw the realized gains and losses associated with the trust. And this year -- and the rest of it was in other comprehensive income. This year, all of it is flowing through the income statement. And as part of that, as we went said this accounting change, we actually moved 600 -- about a $600 million positive into retained earnings that didn't go through the income statement. It was just re-class on the balance sheet from other comprehensive income. So those are the things that were going on there. And of course, we also had some of the portfolio management activities that we talked about that last quarter -- that we're de-risking our portfolio. So our overall loss was a very slight loss compared to maybe an equity market loss of a couple of percent over the quarter. And in regards to our EWC plan, that doesn't change anything overall for our EWC plans, or for our cash expectations towards the end of the -- through to 2020 to. So we still expect [ '17 to '22 ] to be neutral to positive.

So the expectation is that -- the way that that's going to work, and from an income statement perspective, is it will be no effect. But we'll be getting less revenue in the door, which would be a cash item, and we'll also be experiencing lower income tax expense, which would be a non-cash item on the income statements. So they'll offset there, the flow into the cash flow metrics. And so the measures that we were talking about are the metrics like FFO to debt. Last quarter, we talked about 14% on a longer-term basis. Now we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that upfront, but we'll recover much quicker. And so by 2020, we expect to be above that level because of the more rapid return of the unprotected excess ADIT. And from a rate-based perspective, we would expect that as -- and we haven't finished this on a regular process, but as we return that unprotected excess ADIT to customers, our net rate base are to increase. And so on the last call, we talked about the opportunity for about $1 billion of increased net rate base by 2020 -- we still expect that to be the case associated with the return of excess ADIT, both protected and unprotected, by the way, for that."

The bottom line is that as we have been for really over 10 years now, we're in a major technological improvement of the entire system -- started in generation, marched its way into the transmission and now it's getting more into distribution and I would say in some respects, you'd start to see a melting of some of the description opportunities with the kind of generation opportunities we have. So we continue to have an aging generation fleet that we're updating in terms of -- what we've got going on right now, St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Washington, energy centers in the New Orleans power station. The 1,000 megawatts renewable that I talked about are things that will come into play to both on the one hand, replace other aging generation that we would deactivate as new generation comes in line, but they come in line as renewables because they're both a, competitive with generation that they would replace, certainly, the market and potentially, as we go forward with other types of generation. But also, some of them have distribution reliability opportunities as well that just starts to be more localized regeneration, so you're not necessarily avoiding a generation investment. You're avoiding a large transmission investment. So those kinds of technological improvements, plus distribution automation and other things that we could pursue that would allow us to better operate the grid, lower -- customer, customers improve reliability and get closer to them in solutions, all of that we see as just the continuation of the process we've been undergoing. From a regulatory front, you're right. What we have that over the course of the last 5 years in particular is being taken the opportunity to outline the types of investments that we need to make for our regulators and allow us to sync up that regulatory model to match the customer benefits that we're providing with the investments. So, for example what we've done with transmission in Louisiana and the new FRP lines up really well with what was a big source of regulatory lag and a big source of dollars for our customers in the transmission space. So we already had AMI, and generation covered really well. Now we've got transmission in the same bucket as we get a little bit more closely in line with the regulatory mix with the type of investments we're making. So you're right. The future is just improved technological advancements on the system across all functions, and trying to make sure that we and the regulators work to benefit our customers with the most efficient regulatory model that we can get."

Just curious, as you look at Arkansas and Mississippi, are there, over the next few years or beyond, opportunities for conventional generation, either additions or repowerings? And what I'm thinking through this, I'm thinking there are some higher heat rate units in both states that may be aren't as efficient as kind of newer technology, newer gas-fired technologies are?

The majority of the generation add has to do with age and the efficiency, as you mentioned, of the existing fleet that we had. So as we deactivate those, less-efficient, higher costs, less environmentally-friendly units -- we're replacing those with a combination of acquired units whether, it be union [indiscernible] and Todd Springs -- the long list of things that we've already acquired, or the new builds like St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, and Ninemile 6, et cetera. So in those other jurisdictions, that will be there as well. On the first -- on the last quarter call, we identified, I think that -- somebody asked a question about some degeneration dollars that didn't show up, those didn't showing up as one of those jurisdictions because of that same need. And as you mentioned, down the road, we do have the coal plants that -- certainly gase has become very, very competitive with coal, and depending on what happens with environmental regulations, et cetera. So the short answer is yes, we do see a need for new generating resources across all of our jurisdictions, not just with in Louisiana and Texas. And in fact, over the last decade, we've seen us add generation in New Orleans, Mississippi and Arkansas as well. Going forward, it would probably be a combination of looking at new gas, but also some of the projects that have already been announced, for example, project in Arkansas where there's a PPA, that's a renewable resource. So we shouldn't start to see renewables, battery storage, those things show up at some point in time in there, too, as they become competitive. Yes, those fleets are aging as well, and yes, we'll end up with new generating resources there."

Today, we are reporting a solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in more detail, but the bottom line is that this quarter's results keep us on track to achieve our full year UP&O adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlooks.
This first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we executed operationally with success on key projects and regulatory initiatives. The quarter's accomplishments continue our strategic execution on key deliverables dating back to the first quarter of 2015 when we initiated the concepts of our quarterly to-do list. That's 13 consecutive quarters where we've met essentially every goal we set out as critical to our broader overall strategy. Some of our goals were ambitious, but we are confident that we have the organization, focus and commitment to succeed. Our progress this quarter is an extension of those efforts. 
Specifically, we continue to move forward with our newbuild generation projects. The New Orleans Power Station was officially approved, and we've issued full notice to proceed with the engineering procurement and construction contractor. This 128-megawatt reciprocating internal combustion engine facility will provide significant reliability and cost benefits to customers, and it will be the only large-scale generation located within the city of New Orleans. The flexible design of this facility will also make it well suited to support intermittent renewable resources like solar.
The Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also underway. The EPC contractor has been released to start engineering and order major equipment. And this summer, we will issue full notice to proceed on that project. 
As for the St. Charles and Lake Charles Power Stations, construction advances on both projects. All the major equipment is in place for St. Charles, and Lake Charles is well into its engineering and procurement phases and moving forward with its construction phase. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on these important resources, all of which are proceeding on schedule and on budget. 
For Washington Parish Energy Center, we have reached an unopposed agreement in principle, and we'll be preparing settlement documents and filing to present the Louisiana -- to the Louisiana Commission. We expect to present the filing in time for the LPSC consideration this summer.
We are also planning for the future of our power generation organization. We recently announced a partnership with River Parishes Community College to open a power generation training center on the college's campus in Gonzales, Louisiana. We expect to send up to 400 employees each year for training at this center.
We've made significant progress on key transmission projects that will improve reliability, support growth and lower costs for our customers. Our Lake Charles Transmission Project is our largest transmission undertaking ever, and it will provide improved reliability and additional load-serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth. The major components have been completed, with portions now placed in service and already benefiting customers. 
We also completed large projects in Southeast Louisiana and Mississippi that are already providing reliability benefits to customers in those areas, and we are developing and constructing several large projects in Texas.
In addition, the transmission employees achieves over 1 million hours without a recordable accident. That's just over 210 days through the end of the quarter, setting a record for the transmission organization. I applaud our employees for reaching this milestone and their continued diligence and focus on safety.
We are approximately 60% complete with the buildout of the IT systems required to support advanced meter deployment. We are working to complete those systems and finalize meter and communication network development plans as well as customer education plans. The AMI project remains on track to begin meter installations in 2019. These advanced meters will provide significant benefits to our customers, and lay the foundation for the next generation of grid technology investments for our system.
On the regulatory front, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved our unopposed settlement agreement for Entergy Louisiana's annual formula rate plan through 2020. This is a good outcome and another positive step towards ensuring that we have progressed efficient recovery mechanisms in our jurisdictions. This settlement was the result of another constructive, collaborative effort among all the stakeholder groups, and gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in the reliability of our infrastructure for the benefit of our customers.
As part of the settlement, we will reset rates to a 9.95% ROE in 2018, and our customers will receive the benefits of the lower income tax rate. The settlement also includes a provision for the return of more than $200 million to customers for unprotected excess ADIT. Half of that will be returned this year, and the remainder over the next 4 years. The FRP now has a new transmission rider that will help ensure more timely recovery of Entergy Louisiana's transmission investment. The overall framework also includes other refinements that we believe will position us to earn our allowed return in Louisiana during the FRP period. We will submit our first filing under the FRP by the end of June for rates to be effective in September of this year.
And finally, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual FRP in March. Because of the effects of the lower federal tax rate, we requested no change in base rates. The FRP filing also includes our proposal to return unprotected excess ADIT. Under our proposal, Mississippi customers would receive bill credits this year totaling approximately $80 million, and the remaining balance would be used to recover certain items on Entergy Mississippi's balance sheet that otherwise would be in rates. 
Of course, as we execute on our investment plan, we remain focused on customer bills. Today, we already have some of the lowest retail rates in the country. Going forward, the lower federal tax rate, the roll-off of securitizations, continued industrial growth and the deployment of AMI are all important drivers that will help keep our rates low for the benefit of our customers.
Also during the quarter, Entergy Louisiana signed a 10-year agreement with Yuhuang Chemical to supply power to a new methanol facility. YCI is investing $1.5 billion in the construction of its methanol plant, which is scheduled to be completed by first quarter of 2020. This project is just another example of the continuing economic development opportunities in our service areas. We are proud of our contribution to these efforts, as these type of projects are critical to the well-being of the communities we serve. 
Our economic development teams are actively engaged with existing customers, new prospects, Site Selection consultants, state agencies and local economic development organizations to bring more industrial growth opportunities to our region. And we continue to see strong interest, supported by a favorable business and economic environment.  For example, we expect the oil and gas ratio to sustain at competitive levels, which improves customer economics in the petrochemical value chain. In addition, LNG markets are absorbing incremental supply at a fairly rapid pace, and the market is poised to meet additional liquefaction capacity by early 2020. 
And pending International Maritime Organization rules, we capped sulfur and marine fuels starting in 2020. The high sulfur fuel oil that would no longer be suitable for burning in the ships would require secondary processing to further refine the products to meet the new standards just to create an economic opportunity for refiners to incrementally expand secondary processing units, such as hydrocrackers. Overall, the indicators that have led to continued industrial sales growth in our service territory are still trending in a positive direction.
At our merchant business, we continue to focus on safety and risk mitigation as we steadily move toward the end of operations. We reached a settlement agreement for the sale of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. Evidentiary hearings will be held in May, and we've requested a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission in July. That transaction will also require approval from the NRC, and we continue to expect a decision in the third quarter.
With respect to Indian Point, we have received determinations from the New York ISO that IPEC's retirement will not create any reliability concerns, nor will it raise any market power issues. We are on track to retire the units as scheduled. We recently wrapped up our last refueling outage of Unit 2, and that unit is now in its final operating cycle. The outage was completed within our schedule and budget. Indian Point 2 has been an important asset for Entergy and the communities it serves and supports. I would like to acknowledge the work of all of our employees at the plant over the years and their commitment to finish strong.
On April 2, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began its final quarterly inspection of ANO's Confirmatory Action Letter progress. The few remaining CAL items are being addressed in ANO's current refueling outage, and all are expected to be satisfactorily closed to support closure of the Confirmatory Action Letter this June. As a result, we are on track for ANO to exit Column 4 and return to normal oversight by the end of the second quarter.
At Grand Gulf, we are also in a refueling outage, where we are working on a number of important maintenance projects and equipment upgrades. In combination with both the thorough review of processes, procedures and protocols we conducted at the plant and the more than 3,100 hours of training and operations, maintenance of technical fields our crews underwent in the past 18 months, we expect the reliability with the plant and its capability factor to improve going forward.
I'd also like to acknowledge a few awards and recognitions that we have received so far this year. Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi received 2018 ENERGY STAR Awards for their outstanding efforts to promote energy efficiency and educate customers. Entergy was named for the third consecutive year by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to the list of America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises. The honor recognizes corporations that have implemented world-class policies and programs to enable growth and reduce barriers for women on businesses. And the Louisiana Society for Human Resource Management also awarded Entergy its 2018 Excellence in Diversity Award, recognizing the impact we've made fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture.
As a reminder, we recently released our 2017 integrated report entitled Utility Reimagined, where we discussed in detail the many ways we are creating sustainable value for all 4 of our stakeholders. We've increased our environmental, social and governance disclosures and, in particular, we've adopted the Edison Electric Institute's ESG template as part of our integrated report. 
In a continued effort to provide you with relevant information, we are also reviewing and assessing evolving best practices on a 2-degree scenario analysis, including the newly published series framework for U.S. utilities with a view towards preparing a 2-degree scenario analysis that would likely be published either as part of or concurrently with our 2018 integrated report.
We also remain focused on continuing to reduce our carbon footprint. Our efforts began nearly 2 decades ago when we were the first U.S. utility to commit to voluntarily stabilizing CO2 emissions. We are working to expand our portfolio of renewable resources in ways that complement our existing resources and capabilities, while maintaining our low customer rates. On our fourth quarter call in February, we mentioned that we are pursuing over 800 megawatts of renewables. Since then, we have identified new opportunities, and we are now evaluating more than 1,000 megawatts of renewables. Some of these projects have been announced, while others are still in confidential discussions.
As renewable resources continue to become increasingly efficient and cost-competitive, we plan to take further advantage of these opportunities. Increasing our use of renewables is one way for us to meet customer energy needs and expectations. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize the utility industry is in the midst of change. We are planning for the long-term future of the company, and are laying the foundation to provide innovative customer solutions in a changing world.
To further enhance our focus on this commitment, we've assembled a cross-functional team of employees, led by a newly-created leadership position, who reports directly to me. This team is dedicated to developing ideas, evaluating opportunities and implementing action plans to meet the demands of our rapidly evolving industry, and working to identify solutions that leverage new technologies, such as data analytics, automation, distributed generation, utility and community steel, solar, microgrids, battery storage, electric vehicles and other emerging technologies, all while keeping in mind, as we always do, our most impoverished customers and the environment.
Finally, earlier this year, we welcomed John Burbank to our Board of Directors. John has strong experience in developing and executing strategies for customer-facing businesses that are dealing with transformational change. He also has expertise in digital technology, customer data analytics and product development. All of this makes John uniquely suited to help us take advantage of innovations to meet ever-evolving customer expectations.
As I said at the outset, we had a solid to start to 2018, a start that keeps us on our path for continued sustainable growth in our core business. We're well positioned for continued success in delivering on our commitments to you. We are excited about this journey, and we look forward to talking to you more at our Analyst Day on June 21. I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-ter",1118,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlook.
Let's get straight to the numbers. Overall, operational earnings for Entergy consolidated increased $0.17 quarter-over-quarter. Drivers included the lower tax rate, favorable weather as well as the unfavorable effects from the implementation of ASU 2016-01 on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds at EWC. 
Let me we drill down into the different segments, starting with our core Utility, Parent & Other business on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings were $0.12 lower than the prior year due to a few key drivers. Despite strong weather-adjusted sales growth and positive rate actions in both Arkansas and Texas, unbilled sales volumes were lower. We also recorded regulatory provisions at both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to reflect regulatory agreements regarding implementation of the effective tax reform. Combined, these drivers resulted in a decrease.
Non-fuel O&M was higher, largely from nuclear expenses, including nuclear payroll, which has increased as we continue to ramp up staffing pursuant to our plan. We don't expect nuclear to be a significant driver for the full year. In addition, because of the ongoing capital investment in our core business, we naturally see increases in ad valorem and franchise taxes, which are partly offset by an increased AFUDC. And finally, the quarter reflected the lower federal tax rate.
Even though our UP&O-adjusted results were lower quarter-over-quarter, our expectations for the full year have not changed. We remain on track to meet our 2018 guidance through a combination of factors that will benefit us in the second half of the year, including rate actions and O&M timing. Rate actions included an expectation for the recently approved Entergy Louisiana FRP. As Leo mentioned, this is a good outcome for our customers and all of our other stakeholders, and will position Entergy Louisiana to earn its allowed return during the FRP period. As you know, Louisiana is our largest jurisdiction. We're happy with the collaborative effort from all stakeholders to reach this agreement. 
Turning to EWC's first quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.33, approximately $0.04 lower than the prior year. Excluding FitzPatrick, the key driver for EWC was the weak market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Changes in accounting rules now require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market, but this doesn't change our view on the long-term value of the funds, our anticipated cash flows from EWC or efforts toward commercial resolution of the EWC business. The balance of the trust as of March 31 was approximately $4 billion, and the key value driver for decommissioning is identifying economies of scale and engineering solutions that can reduce the ultimate costs. We're aggressively pursuing these types of solutions. 
Lower-income tax expenditure, reductions of the federal tax rate, combined with a change in pretax income, partly offset the overall operational earnings decline.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $557 million, a slight increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower refueling outage spending as well as the effect of favorable weather, partially offset by lower net revenue at EWC. 
Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term UP&O adjusted outlook, which are summarized on Slides 8 and 9. For our consolidated operational guidance, the unfavorable nuclear decommissioning trust returns in the first quarter were lower than our planning assumption. But it's still early in the year. We're working on various opportunities at both Utility and EWC. We're confident that we can overcome first quarter headwinds by the end of the year. 
Also as a reminder, our guidance assumes $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we currently expect to materialize in the third quarter of this year.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the impact of tax reform will start to affect these metrics in the next few quarters. We continue to make good progress on tax reform in our jurisdiction. The dialogue with our regulators is constructed, and we are optimistic that we will receive approvals to return the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT sooner than we originally anticipated. All this will temporarily put additional pressure on our credit metrics. We recognize the value of returning the benefits to our customers sooner rather than later, resolving the uncertainty of how tax reform will be implemented in growing our net rate base faster. This should also accelerate the recovery of our credit metrics. In short, our plan continues to shape up, positioning us better to maintain our current credit rating of BBB+ and Baa2. Our plan still includes issuing approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period, and we still expect that to occur before the end of 2019. The form of equity we issue, the timing of any issuance and the method by which we choose to execute are all under consideration, with a priority of maintaining flexibility to optimize the execution. 
In summary, before I turn to Analyst Day, this was a solid start to the year. Our results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance and outlooks through 2020, continue to strengthen our business risk profile and position us better to maintain our current credit rating. 
Now let's look beyond 2020, which we will discuss in greater detail at Analyst Day. We see no shortage of investment opportunities to sustain our growth beyond our current outlook period, investment opportunities that build on the strong foundation we've established in the past few years, which we continue to solidify. From new, clean, efficient innovative generation resources to grid technologies, such as smart devices, distributed generation, microgrid and battery storage, there is significant investment opportunity to deliver tailored solutions to meet our customers' rapidly-changing expectations. Because of the pace of change that we are anticipating, financial agility will be increasingly important, and that means maintaining or even improving our strong balance sheet. Therefore, at Analyst Day, we will lay out a financing plan that meets our earnings and credit objectives.
We see great opportunities ahead for our company and all our stakeholders. As Leo mentioned, in the future, we want to deliver tailored customer solutions beyond basic power delivery, and provide the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for our customers. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day to continue this dialogue. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And your first question about the drivers, I think, is just the -- is the accounting change that reflected the equity markets over the course of the quarter. And so of course, last year, we did not have to mark-to-market the equity piece. We only saw the realized gains and losses associated with the trust. And this year -- and the rest of it was in other comprehensive income. This year, all of it's flowing through the income statement. And as part of that, as we went to this accounting change, we actually moved 600 -- about a $600 million positive into retained earnings. It didn't go through the income statement. It was just reclassed on the balance sheet from other comprehensive income. So those are the things that were going on there. And of course, we also had some of the portfolio management activities that we talked about last quarter that were de-risking our portfolio. So our overall loss was a very slight loss compared to maybe an equity market loss, a couple percent, over the quarter. And with regards to our EWC plan, that doesn't change anything overall for our EWC plans or for our cash expectations towards the end of the -- through 2022. So we still expect '17 to '22 to be neutral to positive. In fact, as we were thinking about this, earlier this year, we are pressure-testing these -- several things that could happen to make sure that we could sustain that statement through any volatility that we might see in the markets."

So in regards to the cash and the credit metrics and the pay, so we were anticipating, when we talked last quarter, a little slower pace on how fast the unprotected excess ADIT would be flowing back to customers. And now it's a little faster. So the expectation is that -- the way that that's going to work, from an income statement perspective, is there will be no effect. But we'll be getting less revenue in the door, which would be a cash item, and we'll also be experiencing lower income tax expense, which would be a noncash item on the income statements. So it will offset there the flow into the cash flow metrics. And so the measures that we were talking about are the metrics like FFO to debt. Last quarter, we talked about 14% on a longer-term basis. Now we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that upfront, but we'll recover much quicker. And so by the -- by 2020, we expect to be above that level because of the more rapid return of the unprotected excess ADIT. And from a rate-based perspective, we would expect that as -- and we haven't finished this in our regulatory process, but as we return that unprotected excess ADIT to customers, our net rate base ought to increase. And so on the last call, we've talked about the opportunity for about $1 billion of increased net rate base by 2020. We still expect that to be the case associated with the return of excess ADIT, both protected and unprotected, by the way, for that."

Yes, Steve. The bottom line is that, as we have been for really over 10 years now, we're in a major technological improvement of the entire system, started in generation, marched its way into transmission, and now it's getting more into distribution. And I would say, in some respects, you'd start to see a melding of some of the distribution opportunities with the kind of generation opportunities we have. So we continue to have an aging generation fleet that we're updating in terms of what we've got going on right now at St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Washington Parish Energy Center and the New Orleans Power Station. The 1,000 megawatts of renewables that I talked about are things that would come into play to both, on the one hand, replace other aging generation that we would deactivate as new generation comes in line, but they come in line as renewables because they're both, a, competitive with generation that they would replace certainly in the market, and potentially as we go forward with other types of generation. But also some of them have distribution reliability opportunities as well that just starts to be more localized with generation. So you're not necessarily avoiding a generation investment, you're avoiding a large transmission investment. So those kinds of technological improvements, plus distribution automation and other things that we could pursue that would allow us to better operate the grid, lower cost to our customers, improve reliability and get closer to them in solutions, all of that we see as just the continuation of the process we've been undergoing. From a regulatory front, you're right. What we've done over the course of the last 5 years in particular is we've taken the opportunity to outline the types of investments that we need to make for our regulators, and allow us to sync up that regulatory model to match the customer benefits that we're providing with the investments. So for example, what we've done with transmission in Louisiana and the new FRP lines up really well with what was a big source of regulatory lag and a big source of dollars for our customers in the transmission space. So we already had AMI and generation covered really well. Now we've got transmission in the same bucket, as we get a little bit more closely in line with the regulatory mix with the type of investments we're making. So you're right. The future is just improved technological advancements on the system across all functions, and trying to make sure that we and our regulators work to benefit our customers with the most efficient regulatory model that we can get."

The majority of the generation end has to do with the age and the efficiency, as you mentioned, of the existing fleet that we had. So as we deactivate those less-efficient, higher-cost, less environmentally-friendly units, we're replacing those with a combination of acquired units, whether it be Union, Perryville, Ouachita, Calcasieu, Hinds, Hot Springs, the long list of things that we've already acquired, or the newbuilds like St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Ninemile 6, et cetera. So in those other jurisdictions, that will be there as well. On the first -- on the last quarter call, we identified, I think that somebody asked the question about some new generation dollars that had shown up. Those had shown up as one of those other jurisdictions because of that same need. And as you mentioned, down the road, we do have the coal plants that -- certainly, gas has become very, very competitive with coal, and depending on what happens with environmental regulations, et cetera. So the short answer is, yes, we do see the need for new generating resources across all of our jurisdictions, not just Louisiana and Texas. And in fact, over the last decade, we've seen us add generation in New Orleans, Mississippi and Arkansas as well. Going forward, it'll probably be a combination of looking at new gas, but also some of the projects that have already been announced. For example, the Stuttgart project in Arkansas, where we have a PPA. That's a renewable resource. So we should start to see renewables, battery storage, those sorts of things show up at some point in time in there, too, as they become competitive. So yes, those fleets are aging as well and, yes, we'll end up with new generating resources there."

Today, we are reporting solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in",2283,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in more detail, but the bottom line is that this quarter's results keep us on track to achieve our full year UP&O adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlooks.
This first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we executed operationally with success on key projects and regulatory initiatives. The quarter's accomplishments continue our strategic execution on key deliverables dating back to the first quarter of 2015 when we initiated the concepts of our quarterly to-do list. That's 13 consecutive quarters where we've met essentially every goal we set out as critical to our broader overall strategy. Some of our goals were ambitious, but we are confident that we have the organization, focus and commitment to succeed. Our progress this quarter is an extension of those efforts. 
Specifically, we continue to move forward with our newbuild generation projects. The New Orleans Power Station was officially approved, and we've issued full notice to proceed with the engineering procurement and construction contractor. This 128-megawatt reciprocating internal combustion engine facility will provide significant reliability and cost benefits to customers, and it will be the only large-scale generation located within the city of New Orleans. The flexible design of this facility will also make it well suited to support intermittent renewable resources like solar.
The Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also underway. The EPC contractor has been released to start engineering and order major equipment. And this summer, we will issue full notice to proceed on that project. 
As for the St. Charles and Lake Charles Power Stations, construction advances on both projects. All the major equipment is in place for St. Charles, and Lake Charles is well into its engineering and procurement phases and moving forward with its construction phase. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on these important resources, all of which are proceeding on schedule and on budget. 
For Washington Parish Energy Center, we have reached an unopposed agreement in principle, and we'll be preparing settlement documents and filing to present the Louisiana -- to the Louisiana Commission. We expect to present the filing in time for the LPSC consideration this summer.
We are also planning for the future of our power generation organization. We recently announced a partnership with River Parishes Community College to open a power generation training center on the college's campus in Gonzales, Louisiana. We expect to send up to 400 employees each year for training at this center.
We've made significant progress on key transmission projects that will improve reliability, support growth and lower costs for our customers. Our Lake Charles Transmission Project is our largest transmission undertaking ever, and it will provide improved reliability and additional load-serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth. The major components have been completed, with portions now placed in service and already benefiting customers. 
We also completed large projects in Southeast Louisiana and Mississippi that are already providing reliability benefits to customers in those areas, and we are developing and constructing several large projects in Texas.
In addition, the transmission employees achieve over 1 million hours without a recordable accident. That's just over 210 days through the end of the quarter, setting a record for the transmission organization. I applaud our employees for reaching this milestone and their continued diligence and focus on safety.
We are approximately 60% complete with the buildout of the IT systems required to support advanced meter deployment. We are working to complete those systems and finalize meter and communication network development plans as well as customer education plans. The AMI project remains on track to begin meter installations in 2019. These advanced meters will provide significant benefits to our customers, and lay the foundation for the next generation of grid technology investments for our system.
On the regulatory front, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved our unopposed settlement agreement for Entergy Louisiana's annual formula rate plan through 2020. This is a good outcome and another positive step towards ensuring that we have progressed efficient recovery mechanisms in our jurisdictions. This settlement was the result of another constructive, collaborative effort among all the stakeholder groups, and gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in the reliability of our infrastructure for the benefit of our customers.
As part of the settlement, we will reset rates to a 9.95% ROE in 2018, and our customers will receive the benefits of the lower income tax rate. The settlement also includes a provision for the return of more than $200 million to customers for unprotected excess ADIT. Half of that will be returned this year, and the remainder over the next 4 years. The FRP now has a new transmission rider that will help ensure more timely recovery of Entergy Louisiana's transmission investment. The overall framework also includes other refinements that we believe will position us to earn our allowed return in Louisiana during the FRP period. We will submit our first filing under the FRP by the end of June for rates to be effective in September of this year.
And finally, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual FRP in March. Because of the effects of the lower federal tax rate, we requested no change in base rates. The FRP filing also includes our proposal to return unprotected excess ADIT. Under our proposal, Mississippi customers would receive bill credits this year totaling approximately $80 million, and the remaining balance would be used to recover certain items on Entergy Mississippi's balance sheet that otherwise would be in rates. 
Of course, as we execute on our investment plan, we remain focused on customer bills. Today, we already have some of the lowest retail rates in the country. Going forward, the lower federal tax rate, the roll-off of securitizations, continued industrial growth and the deployment of AMI are all important drivers that will help keep our rates low for the benefit of our customers.
Also during the quarter, Entergy Louisiana signed a 10-year agreement with Yuhuang Chemical to supply power to a new methanol facility. YCI is investing $1.5 billion in the construction of its methanol plant, which is scheduled to be completed by first quarter of 2020. This project is just another example of the continuing economic development opportunities in our service areas. We are proud of our contribution to these efforts, as these types of projects are critical to the well-being of the communities we serve. 
Our economic development teams are actively engaged with existing customers, new prospects, Site Selection consultants, state agencies and local economic development organizations to bring more industrial growth opportunities to our region. And we continue to see strong interest, supported by a favorable business and economic environment.  For example, we expect the oil and gas ratio to sustain at competitive levels, which improves customer economics in the petrochemical value chain. In addition, LNG markets are absorbing incremental supply at a fairly rapid pace, and the market is poised to meet additional liquefaction capacity by early 2020. 
And pending International Maritime Organization rules, we capped sulfur and marine fuels starting in 2020. The high sulfur fuel oil that would no longer be suitable for burning in the ships would require secondary processing to further refine the products to meet the new standards just to create an economic opportunity for refiners to incrementally expand secondary processing units, such as hydrocrackers. Overall, the indicators that have led to continued industrial sales growth in our service territory are still trending in a positive direction.
At our merchant business, we continue to focus on safety and risk mitigation as we steadily move toward the end of operations. We reached a settlement agreement for the sale of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. Evidentiary hearings will be held in May, and we've requested a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission in July. That transaction will also require approval from the NRC, and we continue to expect a decision in the third quarter.
With respect to Indian Point, we have received determinations from the New York ISO that IPEC's retirement will not create any reliability concerns, nor will it raise any market power issues. We are on track to retire the units as scheduled. We recently wrapped up our last refueling outage of Unit 2, and that unit is now in its final operating cycle. The outage was completed within our schedule and budget. Indian Point 2 has been an important asset for Entergy and the communities it serves and supports. I would like to acknowledge the work of all of our employees at the plant over the years and their commitment to finish strong.
On April 2, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began its final quarterly inspection of ANO's Confirmatory Action Letter progress. The few remaining CAL items are being addressed in ANO's current refueling outage, and all are expected to be satisfactorily closed to support closure of the Confirmatory Action Letter this June. As a result, we are on track for ANO to exit Column 4 and return to normal oversight by the end of the second quarter.
At Grand Gulf, we are also in a refueling outage, where we are working on a number of important maintenance projects and equipment upgrades. In combination with both the thorough review of processes, procedures and protocols we conducted at the plant and the more than 3,100 hours of training and operations, maintenance of technical fields our crews underwent in the past 18 months, we expect the reliability with the plant and its capability factor to improve going forward.
I'd also like to acknowledge a few awards and recognitions that we have received so far this year. Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi received 2018 ENERGY STAR Awards for their outstanding efforts to promote energy efficiency and educate customers. Entergy was named for the third consecutive year by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to the list of America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises. The honor recognizes corporations that have implemented world-class policies and programs to enable growth and reduce barriers for women on businesses. And the Louisiana Society for Human Resource Management also awarded Entergy its 2018 Excellence in Diversity Award, recognizing the impact we've made fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture.
As a reminder, we recently released our 2017 integrated report entitled Utility Reimagined, where we discussed in detail the many ways we are creating sustainable value for all 4 of our stakeholders. We've increased our environmental, social and governance disclosures and, in particular, we've adopted the Edison Electric Institute's ESG template as part of our integrated report. 
In a continued effort to provide you with relevant information, we are also reviewing and assessing evolving best practices on a 2-degree scenario analysis, including the newly published series framework for U.S. utilities with a view towards preparing a 2-degree scenario analysis that would likely be published either as part of or concurrently with our 2018 integrated report.
We also remain focused on continuing to reduce our carbon footprint. Our efforts began nearly 2 decades ago when we were the first U.S. utility to commit to voluntarily stabilizing CO2 emissions. We are working to expand our portfolio of renewable resources in ways that complement our existing resources and capabilities, while maintaining our low customer rates. On our fourth quarter call in February, we mentioned that we are pursuing over 800 megawatts of renewables. Since then, we have identified new opportunities, and we are now evaluating more than 1,000 megawatts of renewables. Some of these projects have been announced, while others are still in confidential discussions.
As renewable resources continue to become increasingly efficient and cost-competitive, we plan to take further advantage of these opportunities. Increasing our use of renewables is one way for us to meet customer energy needs and expectations. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize the utility industry is in the midst of change. We are planning for the long-term future of the company, and are laying the foundation to provide innovative customer solutions in a changing world.
To further enhance our focus on this commitment, we've assembled a cross-functional team of employees, led by a newly-created leadership position, who reports directly to me. This team is dedicated to developing ideas, evaluating opportunities and implementing action plans to meet the demands of our rapidly evolving industry, and working to identify solutions that leverage new technologies, such as data analytics, automation, distributed generation, utility and community steel, solar, microgrids, battery storage, electric vehicles and other emerging technologies, all while keeping in mind, as we always do, our most impoverished customers and the environment.
Finally, earlier this year, we welcomed John Burbank to our Board of Directors. John has strong experience in developing and executing strategies for customer-facing businesses that are dealing with transformational change. He also has expertise in digital technology, customer data analytics and product development. All of this makes John uniquely suited to help us take advantage of innovations to meet ever-evolving customer expectations.
As I said at the outset, we had a solid to start to 2018, a start that keeps us on our path for continued sustainable growth in our core business. We're well positioned for continued success in delivering on our commitments to you. We are excited about this journey, and we look forward to talking to you more at our Analyst Day on June 21. I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-ter",1118,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlook.
Let's get straight to the numbers. Overall, operational earnings for Entergy consolidated increased $0.17 quarter-over-quarter. Drivers included the lower tax rate, favorable weather as well as the unfavorable effects from the implementation of ASU 2016-01 on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds at EWC. 
Let me we drill down into the different segments, starting with our core Utility, Parent & Other business on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings were $0.12 lower than the prior year due to a few key drivers. Despite strong weather-adjusted sales growth and positive rate actions in both Arkansas and Texas, unbilled sales volumes were lower. We also recorded regulatory provisions at both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to reflect regulatory agreements regarding implementation of the effective tax reform. Combined, these drivers resulted in a decrease.
Non-fuel O&M was higher, largely from nuclear expenses, including nuclear payroll, which has increased as we continue to ramp up staffing pursuant to our plan. We don't expect nuclear to be a significant driver for the full year. In addition, because of the ongoing capital investment in our core business, we naturally see increases in ad valorem and franchise taxes, which are partly offset by an increased AFUDC. And finally, the quarter reflected the lower federal tax rate.
Even though our UP&O-adjusted results were lower quarter-over-quarter, our expectations for the full year have not changed. We remain on track to meet our 2018 guidance through a combination of factors that will benefit us in the second half of the year, including rate actions and O&M timing. Rate actions included an expectation for the recently approved Entergy Louisiana FRP. As Leo mentioned, this is a good outcome for our customers and all of our other stakeholders, and will position Entergy Louisiana to earn its allowed return during the FRP period. As you know, Louisiana is our largest jurisdiction. We're happy with the collaborative effort from all stakeholders to reach this agreement. 
Turning to EWC's first quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.33, approximately $0.04 lower than the prior year. Excluding FitzPatrick, the key driver for EWC was the weak market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Changes in accounting rules now require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market, but this doesn't change our view on the long-term value of the funds, our anticipated cash flows from EWC or efforts toward commercial resolution of the EWC business. The balance of the trust as of March 31 was approximately $4 billion, and the key value driver for decommissioning is identifying economies of scale and engineering solutions that can reduce the ultimate costs. We're aggressively pursuing these types of solutions. 
Lower-income tax expenditure, reductions of the federal tax rate, combined with a change in pretax income, partly offset the overall operational earnings decline.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $557 million, a slight increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower refueling outage spending as well as the effect of favorable weather, partially offset by lower net revenue at EWC. 
Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term UP&O adjusted outlook, which are summarized on Slides 8 and 9. For our consolidated operational guidance, the unfavorable nuclear decommissioning trust returns in the first quarter were lower than our planning assumption. But it's still early in the year. We're working on various opportunities at both Utility and EWC. We're confident that we can overcome first quarter headwinds by the end of the year. 
Also as a reminder, our guidance assumes $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we currently expect to materialize in the third quarter of this year.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the impact of tax reform will start to affect these metrics in the next few quarters. We continue to make good progress on tax reform in our jurisdiction. The dialogue with our regulators is constructed, and we are optimistic that we will receive approvals to return the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT sooner than we originally anticipated. All this will temporarily put additional pressure on our credit metrics. We recognize the value of returning the benefits to our customers sooner rather than later, resolving the uncertainty of how tax reform will be implemented in growing our net rate base faster. This should also accelerate the recovery of our credit metrics. In short, our plan continues to shape up, positioning us better to maintain our current credit rating of BBB+ and Baa2. Our plan still includes issuing approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period, and we still expect that to occur before the end of 2019. The form of equity we issue, the timing of any issuance and the method by which we choose to execute are all under consideration, with a priority of maintaining flexibility to optimize the execution. 
In summary, before I turn to Analyst Day, this was a solid start to the year. Our results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance and outlooks through 2020, continue to strengthen our business risk profile and position us better to maintain our current credit rating. 
Now let's look beyond 2020, which we will discuss in greater detail at Analyst Day. We see no shortage of investment opportunities to sustain our growth beyond our current outlook period, investment opportunities that build on the strong foundation we've established in the past few years, which we continue to solidify. From new, clean, efficient innovative generation resources to grid technologies, such as smart devices, distributed generation, microgrid and battery storage, there is significant investment opportunity to deliver tailored solutions to meet our customers' rapidly-changing expectations. Because of the pace of change that we are anticipating, financial agility will be increasingly important, and that means maintaining or even improving our strong balance sheet. Therefore, at Analyst Day, we will lay out a financing plan that meets our earnings and credit objectives.
We see great opportunities ahead for our company and all our stakeholders. As Leo mentioned, in the future, we want to deliver tailored customer solutions beyond basic power delivery, and provide the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for our customers. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day to continue this dialogue.

And your first question about the drivers, I think, is just the -- is the accounting change that reflected the equity markets over the course of the quarter. And so of course, last year, we did not have to mark-to-market the equity piece. We only saw the realized gains and losses associated with the trust. And this year -- and the rest of it was in other comprehensive income. This year, all of it's flowing through the income statement. And as part of that, as we went to this accounting change, we actually moved 600 -- about a $600 million positive into retained earnings. It didn't go through the income statement. It was just reclassed on the balance sheet from other comprehensive income. So those are the things that were going on there. And of course, we also had some of the portfolio management activities that we talked about last quarter that were de-risking our portfolio. So our overall loss was a very slight loss compared to maybe an equity market loss, a couple percent, over the quarter.

So in regards to the cash and the credit metrics and the pay, so we were anticipating, when we talked last quarter, a little slower pace on how fast the unprotected excess ADIT would be flowing back to customers. And now it's a little faster. So the expectation is that -- the way that that's going to work, from an income statement perspective, is there will be no effect. But we'll be getting less revenue in the door, which would be a cash item, and we'll also be experiencing lower income tax expense, which would be a noncash item on the income statements. So it will offset there the flow into the cash flow metrics. And so the measures that we were talking about are the metrics like FFO to debt. Last quarter, we talked about 14% on a longer-term basis. Now we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that upfront, but we'll recover much quicker. And so by the -- by 2020, we expect to be above that level because of the more rapid return of the unprotected excess ADIT. And from a rate-based perspective, we would expect that as -- and we haven't finished this in our regulatory process, but as we return that unprotected excess ADIT to customers, our net rate base ought to increase. And so on the last call, we've talked about the opportunity for about $1 billion of increased net rate base by 2020.

Yes, Steve. The bottom line is that, as we have been for really over 10 years now, we're in a major technological improvement of the entire system, started in generation, worked its way into transmission, and now it's getting more into distribution. And I would say, in some respects, you'd start to see a melding of some of the distribution opportunities with the kind of generation opportunities we have. So we continue to have an aging generation fleet that we're updating in terms of what we've got going on right now at St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Washington Parish Energy Center and the New Orleans Power Station. The 1,000 megawatts of renewables that I talked about are things that would come into play to both, on the one hand, replace other aging generation that we would deactivate as new generation comes in line, but they come in line as renewables because they're both, a, competitive with generation that they would replace certainly in the market, and potentially as we go forward with other types of generation. But also some of them have distribution reliability opportunities as well that just starts to be more localized with generation. So you're not necessarily avoiding a generation investment, you're avoiding a large transmission investment. So those kinds of technological improvements, plus distribution automation and other things that we could pursue that would allow us to better operate the grid, lower cost to our customers, improve reliability and get closer to them in solutions, all of that we see as just the continuation of the process we've been undergoing. From a regulatory front, you're right. What we've done over the course of the last 5 years in particular is we've taken the opportunity to outline the types of investments that we need to make for our regulators, and allow us to sync up that regulatory model to match the customer benefits that we're providing with the investments. So for example, what we've done with transmission in Louisiana and the new FRP lines up really well with what was a big source of regulatory lag and a big source of dollars for our customers in the transmission space. So we already had AMI and generation covered really well. Now we've got transmission in the same bucket, as we get a little bit more closely in line with the regulatory mix with the type of investments we're making. So you're right. The future is just improved technological advancements on the system across all functions, and trying to make sure that we and our regulators work to benefit our customers with the most efficient regulatory model that we can get."

As Leo mentioned, we've hired 1,000 people over the last year. We're still going to hire some this year. The effect of that payroll change is most acute in the first quarter. And so it will -- the effect of it will -- less than over the next few quarters. But we also have -- even though it's still larger, we have some projects that we had last year that will even out the overall O&M spending for nuclear during the course of the year. So that will be comparable to 2017 by the end of the year. Looking forward, in terms of '19 and '20, I think we have a little under inflation expectations for O&M growth.

Just curious, as you look at Arkansas and Mississippi, are there, over the next few years or beyond, opportunities for conventional generation, either additions or repowerings? And when I'm thinking through this, I'm thinking there are some higher heat rate units in both states that maybe aren't as efficient as kind of newer technology -- newer gas-fired technologies are. You still have a sizable coal unit in Arkansas, with that lax significant pollution controls. I'm just trying to think about those 2 states as drivers of kind of future rate-based growth after going through the cycle you're going though right now in Louisiana and Texas."

The majority of the generation end has to do with the age and the efficiency, as you mentioned, of the existing fleet that we had. So as we deactivate those less-efficient, higher-cost, less environmentally-friendly units, we're replacing those with a combination of acquired units, whether it be Union, Perryville, Ouachita, Calcasieu, Hinds, Hot Springs, the long list of things that we've already acquired, or the newbuilds like St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Ninemile 6, et cetera. So in those other jurisdictions, that will be there as well. On the first -- on the last quarter call, we identified, I think that somebody asked the question about some new generation dollars that had shown up. Those had shown up as one of those other jurisdictions because of that same need. And as you mentioned, down the road, we do have the coal plants that -- certainly, gas has become very, very competitive with coal, and depending on what happens with environmental regulations, et cetera. So the short answer is, yes, we do see the need for new generating resources across all of our jurisdictions, not just Louisiana and Texas. And in fact, over the last decade, we've seen us add generation in New Orleans, Mississippi and Arkansas as well. Going forward, it'll probably be a combination of looking at new gas, but also some of the projects that have already been announced. For example, the Stuttgart project in Arkansas, where we have a PPA. That's a renewable resource. So we should start to see renewables, battery storage, those sorts of things show up at some point in time in there, too, as they become competitive. So yes, those fleets are aging as well and, yes, we'll end up with new generating resources there."

Today, we are reporting solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in",2283,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting solid first quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and consolidated operational earnings of $1.16 per share. Drew will cover the financials in more detail, but the bottom line is that this quarter's results keep us on track to achieve our full year UP&O adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlooks.
This first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we executed operationally with success on key projects and regulatory initiatives. The quarter's accomplishments continue our strategic execution on key deliverables dating back to the first quarter of 2015 when we initiated the concepts of our quarterly to-do list. That's 13 consecutive quarters where we've met essentially every goal we set out as critical to our broader overall strategy. Some of our goals were ambitious, but we are confident that we have the organization, focus and commitment to succeed. Our progress this quarter is an extension of those efforts. 
Specifically, we continue to move forward with our newbuild generation projects. The New Orleans Power Station was officially approved, and we've issued full notice to proceed with the engineering procurement and construction contractor. This 128-megawatt reciprocating internal combustion engine facility will provide significant reliability and cost benefits to customers, and it will be the only large-scale generation located within the city of New Orleans. The flexible design of this facility will also make it well suited to support intermittent renewable resources like solar.
The Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also underway. The EPC contractor has been released to start engineering and order major equipment. And this summer, we will issue full notice to proceed on that project. 
As for the St. Charles and Lake Charles Power Stations, construction advances on both projects. All the major equipment is in place for St. Charles, and Lake Charles is well into its engineering and procurement phases and moving forward with its construction phase. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on these important resources, all of which are proceeding on schedule and on budget. 
For Washington Parish Energy Center, we have reached an unopposed agreement in principle, and we'll be preparing settlement documents and filing to present the Louisiana -- to the Louisiana Commission. We expect to present the filing in time for the LPSC consideration this summer.
We are also planning for the future of our power generation organization. We recently announced a partnership with River Parishes Community College to open a power generation training center on the college's campus in Gonzales, Louisiana. We expect to send up to 400 employees each year for training at this center.
We've made significant progress on key transmission projects that will improve reliability, support growth and lower costs for our customers. Our Lake Charles Transmission Project is our largest transmission undertaking ever, and it will provide improved reliability and additional load-serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth. The major components have been completed, with portions now placed in service and already benefiting customers. 
We also completed large projects in Southeast Louisiana and Mississippi that are already providing reliability benefits to customers in those areas, and we are developing and constructing several large projects in Texas.
In addition, the transmission employees achieve over 1 million hours without a recordable accident. That's just over 210 days through the end of the quarter, setting a record for the transmission organization. I applaud our employees for reaching this milestone and their continued diligence and focus on safety.
We are approximately 60% complete with the buildout of the IT systems required to support advanced meter deployment. We are working to complete those systems and finalize meter and communication network development plans as well as customer education plans. The AMI project remains on track to begin meter installations in 2019. These advanced meters will provide significant benefits to our customers, and lay the foundation for the next generation of grid technology investments for our system.
On the regulatory front, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved our unopposed settlement agreement for Entergy Louisiana's annual formula rate plan through 2020. This is a good outcome and another positive step towards ensuring that we have progressed efficient recovery mechanisms in our jurisdictions. This settlement was the result of another constructive, collaborative effort among all the stakeholder groups, and gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in the reliability of our infrastructure for the benefit of our customers.
As part of the settlement, we will reset rates to a 9.95% ROE in 2018, and our customers will receive the benefits of the lower income tax rate. The settlement also includes a provision for the return of more than $200 million to customers for unprotected excess ADIT. Half of that will be returned this year, and the remainder over the next 4 years. The FRP now has a new transmission rider that will help ensure more timely recovery of Entergy Louisiana's transmission investment. The overall framework also includes other refinements that we believe will position us to earn our allowed return in Louisiana during the FRP period. We will submit our first filing under the FRP by the end of June for rates to be effective in September of this year.
And finally, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual FRP in March. Because of the effects of the lower federal tax rate, we requested no change in base rates. The FRP filing also includes our proposal to return unprotected excess ADIT. Under our proposal, Mississippi customers would receive bill credits this year totaling approximately $80 million, and the remaining balance would be used to recover certain items on Entergy Mississippi's balance sheet that otherwise would be in rates. 
Of course, as we execute on our investment plan, we remain focused on customer bills. Today, we already have some of the lowest retail rates in the country. Going forward, the lower federal tax rate, the roll-off of securitizations, continued industrial growth and the deployment of AMI are all important drivers that will help keep our rates low for the benefit of our customers.
Also during the quarter, Entergy Louisiana signed a 10-year agreement with Yuhuang Chemical to supply power to a new methanol facility. YCI is investing $1.5 billion in the construction of its methanol plant, which is scheduled to be completed by first quarter of 2020. This project is just another example of the continuing economic development opportunities in our service areas. We are proud of our contribution to these efforts, as these types of projects are critical to the well-being of the communities we serve. 
Our economic development teams are actively engaged with existing customers, new prospects, Site Selection consultants, state agencies and local economic development organizations to bring more industrial growth opportunities to our region. And we continue to see strong interest, supported by a favorable business and economic environment.  For example, we expect the oil and gas ratio to sustain at competitive levels, which improves customer economics in the petrochemical value chain. In addition, LNG markets are absorbing incremental supply at a fairly rapid pace, and the market is poised to meet additional liquefaction capacity by early 2020. 
And pending International Maritime Organization rules, we capped sulfur and marine fuels starting in 2020. The high sulfur fuel oil that would no longer be suitable for burning in the ships would require secondary processing to further refine the products to meet the new standards just to create an economic opportunity for refiners to incrementally expand secondary processing units, such as hydrocrackers. Overall, the indicators that have led to continued industrial sales growth in our service territory are still trending in a positive direction.
At our merchant business, we continue to focus on safety and risk mitigation as we steadily move toward the end of operations. We reached a settlement agreement for the sale of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. Evidentiary hearings will be held in May, and we've requested a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission in July. That transaction will also require approval from the NRC, and we continue to expect a decision in the third quarter.
With respect to Indian Point, we have received determinations from the New York ISO that IPEC's retirement will not create any reliability concerns, nor will it raise any market power issues. We are on track to retire the units as scheduled. We recently wrapped up our last refueling outage of Unit 2, and that unit is now in its final operating cycle. The outage was completed within our schedule and budget. Indian Point 2 has been an important asset for Entergy and the communities it serves and supports. I would like to acknowledge the work of all of our employees at the plant over the years and their commitment to finish strong.
On April 2, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began its final quarterly inspection of ANO's Confirmatory Action Letter progress. The few remaining CAL items are being addressed in ANO's current refueling outage, and all are expected to be satisfactorily closed to support closure of the Confirmatory Action Letter this June. As a result, we are on track for ANO to exit Column 4 and return to normal oversight by the end of the second quarter.
At Grand Gulf, we are also in a refueling outage, where we are working on a number of important maintenance projects and equipment upgrades. In combination with both the thorough review of processes, procedures and protocols we conducted at the plant and the more than 3,100 hours of training and operations, maintenance of technical fields our crews underwent in the past 18 months, we expect the reliability with the plant and its capability factor to improve going forward.
I'd also like to acknowledge a few awards and recognitions that we have received so far this year. Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi received 2018 ENERGY STAR Awards for their outstanding efforts to promote energy efficiency and educate customers. Entergy was named for the third consecutive year by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to the list of America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises. The honor recognizes corporations that have implemented world-class policies and programs to enable growth and reduce barriers for women on businesses. And the Louisiana Society for Human Resource Management also awarded Entergy its 2018 Excellence in Diversity Award, recognizing the impact we've made fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture.
As a reminder, we recently released our 2017 integrated report entitled Utility Reimagined, where we discussed in detail the many ways we are creating sustainable value for all 4 of our stakeholders. We've increased our environmental, social and governance disclosures and, in particular, we've adopted the Edison Electric Institute's ESG template as part of our integrated report. 
In a continued effort to provide you with relevant information, we are also reviewing and assessing evolving best practices on a 2-degree scenario analysis, including the newly published series framework for U.S. utilities with a view towards preparing a 2-degree scenario analysis that would likely be published either as part of or concurrently with our 2018 integrated report.
We also remain focused on continuing to reduce our carbon footprint. Our efforts began nearly 2 decades ago when we were the first U.S. utility to commit to voluntarily stabilizing CO2 emissions. We are working to expand our portfolio of renewable resources in ways that complement our existing resources and capabilities, while maintaining our low customer rates. On our fourth quarter call in February, we mentioned that we are pursuing over 800 megawatts of renewables. Since then, we have identified new opportunities, and we are now evaluating more than 1,000 megawatts of renewables. Some of these projects have been announced, while others are still in confidential discussions.
As renewable resources continue to become increasingly efficient and cost-competitive, we plan to take further advantage of these opportunities. Increasing our use of renewables is one way for us to meet customer energy needs and expectations. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize the utility industry is in the midst of change. We are planning for the long-term future of the company, and are laying the foundation to provide innovative customer solutions in a changing world.
To further enhance our focus on this commitment, we've assembled a cross-functional team of employees, led by a newly-created leadership position, who reports directly to me. This team is dedicated to developing ideas, evaluating opportunities and implementing action plans to meet the demands of our rapidly evolving industry, and working to identify solutions that leverage new technologies, such as data analytics, automation, distributed generation, utility and community steel, solar, microgrids, battery storage, electric vehicles and other emerging technologies, all while keeping in mind, as we always do, our most impoverished customers and the environment.
Finally, earlier this year, we welcomed John Burbank to our Board of Directors. John has strong experience in developing and executing strategies for customer-facing businesses that are dealing with transformational change. He also has expertise in digital technology, customer data analytics and product development. All of this makes John uniquely suited to help us take advantage of innovations to meet ever-evolving customer expectations.
As I said at the outset, we had a solid to start to 2018, a start that keeps us on our path for continued sustainable growth in our core business. We're well positioned for continued success in delivering on our commitments to you. We are excited about this journey, and we look forward to talking to you more at our Analyst Day on June 21. I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-ter",1118,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, and the bottom line is that we are on track to meet our full year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted and consolidated operational guidance and our long-term outlook.
Let's get straight to the numbers. Overall, operational earnings for Entergy consolidated increased $0.17 quarter-over-quarter. Drivers included the lower tax rate, favorable weather as well as the unfavorable effects from the implementation of ASU 2016-01 on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds at EWC. 
Let me we drill down into the different segments, starting with our core Utility, Parent & Other business on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings were $0.12 lower than the prior year due to a few key drivers. Despite strong weather-adjusted sales growth and positive rate actions in both Arkansas and Texas, unbilled sales volumes were lower. We also recorded regulatory provisions at both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to reflect regulatory agreements regarding implementation of the effective tax reform. Combined, these drivers resulted in a decrease.
Non-fuel O&M was higher, largely from nuclear expenses, including nuclear payroll, which has increased as we continue to ramp up staffing pursuant to our plan. We don't expect nuclear to be a significant driver for the full year. In addition, because of the ongoing capital investment in our core business, we naturally see increases in ad valorem and franchise taxes, which are partly offset by an increased AFUDC. And finally, the quarter reflected the lower federal tax rate.
Even though our UP&O-adjusted results were lower quarter-over-quarter, our expectations for the full year have not changed. We remain on track to meet our 2018 guidance through a combination of factors that will benefit us in the second half of the year, including rate actions and O&M timing. Rate actions included an expectation for the recently approved Entergy Louisiana FRP. As Leo mentioned, this is a good outcome for our customers and all of our other stakeholders, and will position Entergy Louisiana to earn its allowed return during the FRP period. As you know, Louisiana is our largest jurisdiction. We're happy with the collaborative effort from all stakeholders to reach this agreement. 
Turning to EWC's first quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.33, approximately $0.04 lower than the prior year. Excluding FitzPatrick, the key driver for EWC was the weak market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Changes in accounting rules now require us to mark the equity portion of those investments to market, but this doesn't change our view on the long-term value of the funds, our anticipated cash flows from EWC or efforts toward commercial resolution of the EWC business. The balance of the trust as of March 31 was approximately $4 billion, and the key value driver for decommissioning is identifying economies of scale and engineering solutions that can reduce the ultimate costs. We're aggressively pursuing these types of solutions. 
Lower-income tax expenditure, reductions of the federal tax rate, combined with a change in pretax income, partly offset the overall operational earnings decline.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $557 million, a slight increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower refueling outage spending as well as the effect of favorable weather, partially offset by lower net revenue at EWC. 
Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term UP&O adjusted outlook, which are summarized on Slides 8 and 9. For our consolidated operational guidance, the unfavorable nuclear decommissioning trust returns in the first quarter were lower than our planning assumption. But it's still early in the year. We're working on various opportunities at both Utility and EWC. We're confident that we can overcome first quarter headwinds by the end of the year. 
Also as a reminder, our guidance assumes $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we currently expect to materialize in the third quarter of this year.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the impact of tax reform will start to affect these metrics in the next few quarters. We continue to make good progress on tax reform in our jurisdiction. The dialogue with our regulators is constructed, and we are optimistic that we will receive approvals to return the unprotected portion of the excess ADIT sooner than we originally anticipated. All this will temporarily put additional pressure on our credit metrics. We recognize the value of returning the benefits to our customers sooner rather than later, resolving the uncertainty of how tax reform will be implemented in growing our net rate base faster. This should also accelerate the recovery of our credit metrics. In short, our plan continues to shape up, positioning us better to maintain our current credit rating of BBB+ and Baa2. Our plan still includes issuing approximately $1 billion of equity over our outlook period, and we still expect that to occur before the end of 2019. The form of equity we issue, the timing of any issuance and the method by which we choose to execute are all under consideration, with a priority of maintaining flexibility to optimize the execution. 
In summary, before I turn to Analyst Day, this was a solid start to the year. Our results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance and outlooks through 2020, continue to strengthen our business risk profile and position us better to maintain our current credit rating. 
Now let's look beyond 2020, which we will discuss in greater detail at Analyst Day. We see no shortage of investment opportunities to sustain our growth beyond our current outlook period, investment opportunities that build on the strong foundation we've established in the past few years, which we continue to solidify. From new, clean, efficient innovative generation resources to grid technologies, such as smart devices, distributed generation, microgrid and battery storage, there is significant investment opportunity to deliver tailored solutions to meet our customers' rapidly-changing expectations. Because of the pace of change that we are anticipating, financial agility will be increasingly important, and that means maintaining or even improving our strong balance sheet. Therefore, at Analyst Day, we will lay out a financing plan that meets our earnings and credit objectives.
We see great opportunities ahead for our company and all our stakeholders. As Leo mentioned, in the future, we want to deliver tailored customer solutions beyond basic power delivery, and provide the most accessible, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy mix for our customers. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day to continue this dialogue. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And your first question about the drivers, I think, is just the -- is the accounting change that reflected the equity markets over the course of the quarter. And so of course, last year, we did not have to mark-to-market the equity piece. We only saw the realized gains and losses associated with the trust. And this year -- and the rest of it was in other comprehensive income. This year, all of it's flowing through the income statement. And as part of that, as we went to this accounting change, we actually moved 600 -- about a $600 million positive into retained earnings. It didn't go through the income statement. It was just reclassed on the balance sheet from other comprehensive income. So those are the things that were going on there. And of course, we also had some of the portfolio management activities that we talked about last quarter that were de-risking our portfolio. So our overall loss was a very slight loss compared to maybe an equity market loss, a couple percent, over the quarter. And with regards to our EWC plan, that doesn't change anything overall for our EWC plans or for our cash expectations towards the end of the -- through 2022. So we still expect '17 to '22 to be neutral to positive. In fact, as we were thinking about this, earlier this year, we are pressure-testing these -- several things that could happen to make sure that we could sustain that statements through any volatility that we might see in the markets."

And now it's a little faster. So the expectation is that -- the way that that's going to work, from an income statement perspective, is there will be no effect. But we'll be getting less revenue in the door, which would be a cash item, and we'll also be experiencing lower income tax expense, which would be a noncash item on the income statements. So it will offset there the flow into the cash flow metrics. And so the measures that we were talking about are the metrics like FFO to debt. Last quarter, we talked about 14% on a longer-term basis. Now we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that upfront, but we'll recover much quicker. And so by the -- by 2020, we expect to be above that level because of the more rapid return of the unprotected excess ADIT. And from a rate-based perspective, we would expect that as -- and we haven't finished this in our regulatory process, but as we return that unprotected excess ADIT to customers, our net rate base ought to increase. And so on the last call, we've talked about the opportunity for about $1 billion of increased net rate base by 2020.

Yes, Steve. The bottom line is that, as we have been for really over 10 years now, we're in a major technological improvement of the entire system, started in generation, worked its way into transmission, and now it's getting more into distribution. And I would say, in some respects, you'd start to see a melding of some of the distribution opportunities with the kind of generation opportunities we have. So we continue to have an aging generation fleet that we're updating in terms of what we've got going on right now at St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Washington Parish Energy Center and the New Orleans Power Station. The 1,000 megawatts of renewables that I talked about are things that would come into play to both, on the one hand, replace other aging generation that we would deactivate as new generation comes in line, but they come in line as renewables because they're both, a, competitive with generation that they would replace certainly in the market, and potentially as we go forward with other types of generation. But also some of them have distribution reliability opportunities as well that just starts to be more localized with generation. So you're not necessarily avoiding a generation investment, you're avoiding a large transmission investment. So those kinds of technological improvements, plus distribution automation and other things that we could pursue that would allow us to better operate the grid, lower cost to our customers, improve reliability and get closer to them in solutions, all of that we see as just the continuation of the process we've been undergoing. From a regulatory front, you're right. What we've done over the course of the last 5 years in particular is we've taken the opportunity to outline the types of investments that we need to make for our regulators, and allow us to sync up that regulatory model to match the customer benefits that we're providing with the investments. So for example, what we've done with transmission in Louisiana and the new FRP lines up really well with what was a big source of regulatory lag and a big source of dollars for our customers in the transmission space. So we already had AMI and generation covered really well. Now we've got transmission in the same bucket, as we get a little bit more closely in line with the regulatory mix with the type of investments we're making. So you're right. The future is just improved technological advancements on the system across all functions, and trying to make sure that we and our regulators work to benefit our customers with the most efficient regulatory model that we can get."

And so it will -- the effect of it will -- less than over the next few quarters.

And when I'm thinking through this, I'm thinking there are some higher heat rate units in both states that maybe aren't as efficient as kind of newer technology -- newer gas-fired technologies are.

The majority of the generation end has to do with the age and the efficiency, as you mentioned, of the existing fleet that we had. So as we deactivate those less-efficient, higher-cost, less environmentally-friendly units, we're replacing those with a combination of acquired units, whether it be Union, Perryville, Ouachita, Calcasieu, Hinds, Hot Springs, the long list of things that we've already acquired, or the newbuilds like St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Ninemile 6, et cetera. So in those other jurisdictions, that will be there as well. On the first -- on the last quarter call, we identified, I think that somebody asked the question about some new generation dollars that had shown up. Those had shown up as one of those other jurisdictions because of that same need. And as you mentioned, down the road, we do have the coal plants that -- certainly, gas has become very, very competitive with coal, and depending on what happens with environmental regulations, et cetera. So the short answer is, yes, we do see the need for new generating resources across all of our jurisdictions, not just Louisiana and Texas. And in fact, over the last decade, we've seen us add generation in New Orleans, Mississippi and Arkansas as well. Going forward, it'll probably be a combination of looking at new gas, but also some of the projects that have already been announced. For example, the Stuttgart project in Arkansas, where we have a PPA. That's a renewable resource. So we should start to see renewables, battery storage, those sorts of things show up at some point in time in there, too, as they become competitive. So yes, those fleets are aging as well and, yes, we'll end up with new generating resources there."

Given that we're coming off of the Analyst Day, ouir remarks today will be brief.

Given that we're coming off of the Analyst Day, ouir remarks today will be brief. The main update is that we had a strong quarter, and we remain on track with all of our strategic operational and financial objectives. As we stated when we saw you in New York, very solid capital plan that is largely ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint, with a demonstrated track record on-time and on-budget performance.
This capital plan will modernize our technology across all functional groups and provide significant value for our customers in-service level, sustainability and cost, while fueling growth in our business. Additionally, we continue to make significant progress toward transitioning to a pure-play utility as evidenced by our announcement today that we have signed purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of International to sell both Pilgrim and Palisades after their scheduled shutdown.
Turning to financial results. We are reporting second quarter Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $1.23, and consolidated operational earnings per share of $1.79. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail. This quarter results keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.
At our businesses, as we continued to make good progress, achieving our goals. Starting with major projects, in Louisiana, the Public Service Commission approved our agreement to purchase Washington Parish Energy Center. will construct the 361-megawatt facility, which we expect to purchase in 2021.
We also continue to make progress on our 4 newbuild generation projects. We discussed those in detail at our Analyst Day, and all projects remain on budget and on schedule. Yesterday, we issued a full notice to proceed on the Montgomery County powerstation. The transmission of $187 million Lake Charles Transmission Project is nearing completion. Major portions are already in service, providing benefits to our customers.
We are finishing the final major phase of work, replacing the towers to expand the River. We expect completion in the third quarter. With approximately 1,000 megawatts in various stages of development, we're committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.
In Arkansas, the commission approved a new 100-megawatt solar PPA, which includes our green pricing tariff option for Entergy Arkansas customers. Entergy New Orleans submitted a request to approve 3 renewal of projects totaling 90 megawatts of solar generation, including a 20-megawatt PPA, a 20-megawatt self-build and a 50-megawatt acquisition.
The projects would be expected to be in service in 2020 or 2021 time frame. Entergy New Orleans also included a request in it's rate case filing to implement a community server and a green pricing option, and we are evaluating similar offerings in our other jurisdictions.
Turning to nuclear operations. units 1 and 2 have returned to NRC's reactor oversight process. This marks the culmination of a comprehensive and dedicated effort by our nuclear team, especially our Arkansas Nuclear One employees. As a result of this hard work, we have improved human performance, equipment reliability and safety culture.
At Grand Gulf, the NRC held an exit conference on June 28. At that meeting, the NRC concluded that the plant had successfully met the objectives for the supplemental inspection. We expect Grand Gulf to transition the Column 1 once the inspection report is issued, which we anticipate later this month.
Turning to the regulatory activity. We've been busy with red proceedings in all 5 of our jurisdictions. We are pleased to note that when combined with the positive resolutions around the implementation of tax reform, we expect our customers to see minimal impacts to their rates over the next 2 years, even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan.
Specifically, Entergy Mississippi received approval for its annual FRP. The filing resolved of the effects of tax reform, including customer refunds and rate-base offsets. And because of the lower federal tax rate, no base rate change was needed. In May, Texas submitted its filing request a net base rate change of $118 million. In addition, we proposed refunds of unprotected excess ADIT to Entergy Texas customers, which will return approximately $200 million over 2 years.
The net impact to customer rates in the next few years will be $17 million, significantly lower than the base rate impact.
Entergy Louisiana filed its annual FRP in June. Because of the effects of tax reform and cost rolling off the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, customer rates were actually declined over the rate-effective period. Entergy Arkansas filed its annual evaluation report in early June -- July. Because of the 4% rate cap, we requested revenue change of $65 million for 2019. This rate change will be more than offset by the return of $466 million of unprotected excess ADIT through the end of next year.
And finally,, Entergy New Orleans filed its base rate case yesterday, which reflects an expected net decrease of approximately $20 million.
We also requested a formula rate plan for test years 2019 through 2021 and several new customer offerings, such as a prepaid tariff that we intend to launch after AMI is fully deployed, electric vehicle charging infrastructure tariff and the fixed billing option. These filings are an important piece to achieving our objectives. They're also an illustration of commitment of our leadership, our employees and our regulators to our customers.
I appreciate our retail regulators timely and constructive review and evaluation, not only of these filings, but on the broader portfolio changes were implemented together in the past several years for the benefit of our customers. We look forward to our continued constructive relationships.
As I just mentioned, in the quarter customers started to see benefits from tax reform in their bills, which included $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT. More than half of that, a $150 million, was credited to customer bills. The remainder radius plant balances at Entergy Mississippi. $278 million of benefits in 1 quarter is impressive, and represents substantial savings for our customers.
At EWC, our proposal to sell Vermont Yankee to is still progressing. We are awaiting approvals from the NRC and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. If Vermont Commission has decided to issue its decision regarding the settlement, after the NRC determination is made, which we expect late in the third quarter.
At the plant, all of the remaining nuclear fuel has been removed from the spent fuel pool and loaded into the last dry full canister, which will be moved out to the fuel pad within the next few days. This is an important milestone for Aviva transaction as completing this work is a condition to close.
We still target completion of the transaction by year end. Additionally, today we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades to Nuclear Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of International. With these agreements, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our remaining 4 EWC nuclear sites. This significantly furthers our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility.
The agreement will accelerate decommissioning at both sites. has partnered with SNC Lobbying Group to perform Decommissioning International or CDI, which will complete the decommissioning work. CDI brings significant experience and expertise in decommissioning and site remediation. We are very pleased with this announcement and the incremental clarity it provides for our exit from EWC.
At Indian Point, Unit 2 completed its final refueling outage. That unit is now in its final operating cycle. We are proud of the significant benefits that Unit 2 has provided for customers and its communities We remain focused on finishing strong until the unit closes in April of 2020.
I'd also like to highlight a few of our other activities and achievements. In June, we received about 29 EEI Award for Emergency Response, following severe winter storms in the Northeast. The work of Entergy's to restore power to customers impacted by the is a great example of mutual assistance in action and our industry's commitment to serving customers.
In May, we went to a nation's capital to advocate for low income customers. We help the United Way introduce a nationwide effort to quantify and describe the number of households that are struggling financially. The program is titled and represents family sort employed, but had limited assets and limited income.
Hoping Alice families in our communities is an important business and imperative for us. As our success is directly tied to of our communities. As a result of efforts like this, Entergy was once again made 1 of the 50 most community-minded communities in The United States.
As I said, at the outset that we had a strong quarter. 2018 has already been a year of significant accomplishments to keep us on track to meet all of our strategic operational and financial objectives.
At the utility, we're managing our business to preserve competitive rates for our customers even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan. At EWC, without announcement to sell Polygram and Palisades, we continue to make significant progress throughout transitioning to a pure-play utility. Finally, our financial results firmly position us to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.
We look forward to a productive second half of the year. And I'll now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we've reinforced at Analyst Day.In particular, the results for the quarter was strong and keep us firmly on track to",959,"Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we've reinforced at Analyst Day.
In particular, the results for the quarter was strong and keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance a longer-term outlook. While I turn to the results in greater detail, there are 2 items of note for the quarter that I'd like to point out.
First, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. This is a positive outcome and it generated an earnings benefit of $0.31.
Second, as Leo mentioned, customer started to see benefits from $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT related to tax reform. As a result, the net revenue and income tax lines are complex. And will continue until customers have received the full benefit of the return.
But remember, these entries offset each other dollar for dollar so there is no bottom line earnings impact. Beyond the accounting, I want to point out that within 6 months of of the tax reform, we achieved sufficient clarity around implementation such as our customers are already receiving significant benefit.
This accomplishment is a direct result of collaborative efforts with our retail regulators to meet our customers expectation. Now turning to results on Slide 4. Operational earnings for Entergy consolidated were $1.32 lower than second quarter 2017. You'll recall that last year results reflected approximately $2 of income tax benefit at EWC.
This year's results include $0.31 of income tax benefit, $0.24 of which is at UP&O. This is a result of the 2012 and 2013 IRS audit I mentioned a moment ago. Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5, adjusted earnings were $0.11 higher than the prior year. Excluding the $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT, net revenue increased as a result of higher unbilled sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas.
Similar to last quarter, regulatory provisions returned benefits of the lower tax rate to customers in Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, partially offset the quarter's increase. And other factors included higher non-fuel O&M due largely to average cost as well as energy efficiency and storm reserves. Lower income tax expense due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate, and lastly, other drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation and interest expenses.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.14. Excluding last year's tax item, the key driver for EWC was higher net revenue due to higher sales volume as a result of fewer outage days in second quarter 2018.
Lower energy pricing somewhat offset this increase. Before leaving EWC, I would like to mention a few details regarding the progress of efforts to reduce risk at EWC and transform our company. As Leo said, the Pilgrim and Palisades transaction -- with the Pilgrim and Palisades transactions is now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our 4 remaining EWC nuclear sites. And this transaction support our expectation for EWC to provide a positive net cash to parent through 2022.
Energy sales are approximate 90% hedged for the remanding life of our asset, significantly reducing our revenue risk. We've improved operations through the focus work of our dedicated nuclear employees and expect Pilgrim to return to Column 1 before the plant closes in 2019. As Leo also mentioned at all the remaining nuclear fuels has been moved from the spent fuel pool and soon be loaded to dry fuel cost for long-term storage.
These collective actions significantly further our strategy to transition to a pure play utility. Turning back to the quarter, Slide 7 shows operating cash flow totaling $523 million, approximately $230 million higher than a year ago. The increase is due to lower nuclear refueling outage spending, lower and retention payments at EWC and increased collections of fuel and purchased power cost and utility. However, return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers partly offset the increase.
Slides 8 and 9 contain our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term Utility, Parent & Other adjusted outlook, both of which we are affirming today. For 2018, we expect results to come in or around the midpoint for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted, and in the top off of the range for consolidated operational.
Also, as we mentioned on last quarter's call, our consolidated operational guidance assumes a $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we still expect to materialize in the third quarter.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our FFO-to-debt percentage remains at 15.4%, and our parent debt-to-total debt has increased to 24.1%. The increase in parent debt-to-total debt is timing related due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT and capital investment for growth.
This measure should move lower this year with incremental debt issuance of the utility and realization of a portion of the equity sale. We remain committed to our FFO-to-debt target at or above 15% by 2020, our parent debt-to-total-debt at or below 25%.
Before returning to Q&A, I want to thank you for joining our Analyst Day, even in person or through the webcast. As we demonstrated, we have compelling strategy that translates into a strong financial growth and value for our investors. With our capital plan largely ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint and good visibility on our rate base growth, we are confident in our 5% to 7% UP&O adjusted growth trajectory.
Our accomplishment this quarter directly support our plan and objectives, and we are firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

Given that we're coming off of Analyst Day, our remarks today will be brief.

Given that we're coming off of Analyst Day, our remarks today will be brief. The main update is that we had a strong quarter, and we remain on track with all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives. 
As we stated when we saw you in New York, we have a solid capital plan that is largely ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint, with a demonstrated track record of on-time and on-budget performance.  This capital plan will modernize our technology across all functional groups and provide significant value for our customers in service level, sustainability and costs, while fueling growth in our business. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant progress toward transitioning to a pure-play utility as evidenced by our announcement today that we have signed purchase and sale agreements with a subsidiary of Holtec International to sell both Pilgrim and Palisades after their scheduled shutdowns. 
Turning to financial results. We are reporting second quarter Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $1.23 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $1.79. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail. But this quarter's results keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.
At our businesses, we continue to make good progress achieving our goals. Starting with major projects: In Louisiana, the Public Service Commission approved our agreement to purchase Washington Parish Energy Center. Calpine will construct the 361-megawatt facility, which we expect to purchase in 2021.
We also continue to make progress on our 4 newbuild generation projects. We discussed those in detail at our Analyst Day, and all projects remain on-budget and on-schedule. Yesterday, we issued a full notice to proceed on the Montgomery County Power Station. 
The transmission of $187 million Lake Charles Transmission Project is nearing completion. Major portions are already in service, providing benefits to our customers.  We are finishing the final major phase of work, replacing the towers and line that span the Calcasieu River. We expect completion in the third quarter. With approximately 1,000 megawatts in various stages of development, we're committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.
In Arkansas, the Commission approved a new 100-megawatt solar PPA, which includes the Green Pricing Tariff option for Entergy Arkansas customers. Entergy New Orleans submitted a request to approve 3 renewable projects totaling 90 megawatts of solar generation, including a 20-megawatt PPA, a 20-megawatt self-build and a 50-megawatt acquisition.  The projects would be expected to be in service in the 2020 or 2021 time frame. Entergy New Orleans also included a request in it's rate case filing to implement a community solar and a Green Pricing option, and we're evaluating similar offerings in our other jurisdictions.
Turning to nuclear operations. ANO Units 1 and 2 have returned to Column 1 of the NRC's reactor oversight process. This marks the culmination of a comprehensive and dedicated effort by our nuclear team, especially our Arkansas Nuclear One employees. As a result of this hard work, we have improved human performance, equipment reliability and safety culture.
At Grand Gulf, the NRC held an exit conference on June 28. At that meeting, the NRC concluded that the plant had successfully met the objectives for the supplemental inspection. We expect Grand Gulf's transition the Column 1 once the inspection report is issued, which we anticipate later this month.
Turning to the regulatory activity. We've been busy with rate proceedings in all 5 of our jurisdictions. We are pleased to note that when combined with the positive resolutions around the implementation of tax reform, we expect our customers to see minimal impacts to the rates over the next 2 years, even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan.  Specifically, Entergy Mississippi received approval for its annual FRP. The filing resolved the effects of tax reform, including customer refunds and rate base offsets. And because of the lower federal tax rate, no base rate change was needed. 
In May, Texas submitted its filing request a net base rate change of $118 million. In addition, we proposed refunds of unprotected excess ADIT to Entergy Texas customers, which will return approximately $200 million over 2 years.  The net impact to customer rates in the next few years will be $17 million, significantly lower than the base rate impact.
Entergy Louisiana filed its annual FRP in June. Because of the effects of tax reform and cost rolling off the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, customer rates were actually declined over the rate-effective period. 
Entergy Arkansas filed its annual evaluation report in early June -- July. Because of the 4% rate cap, we requested revenue change of $65 million for 2019. This rate change will be more than offset by the return of $466 million of unprotected excess ADIT through the end of next year.  
And finally, Entergy New Orleans filed its base rate case yesterday, which reflects an expected net decrease of approximately $20 million.
We also requested a formula rate plan for test years 2019 through 2021, and several new customer offerings, such as a prepaid tariff that we intend to launch after AMI is fully deployed, electric vehicle charging infrastructure tariff and a fixed billing option. These filings are an important piece to achieving our objectives. They're also an illustration of the commitment of our leadership, our employees and our regulators to our customers.
I appreciate our retail regulators timely and constructive review and evaluation, not only of these filings, but on the broader portfolio changes we implemented together in the past several years for the benefit of our customers. We look forward to our continued constructive relationships.
As I just mentioned, in the quarter, customers started to see benefits from tax reform in their bills, which included $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT. More than half of that, a $150 million, was credited to customer bills. The remainder reduced plant balances at Entergy Mississippi. $278 million of benefits in one quarter is impressive, and represents substantial savings for our customers.
At EWC, our proposal to sell Vermont Yankee to NorthStar is still progressing. We are awaiting approvals from the NRC and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. If Vermont Commission has decided to issue its decision regarding the settlement, after the NRC determination is made, which we expect late in the third quarter.
At the plant, all of the remaining nuclear fuel has been removed from the spent fuel pool and loaded into the last dry fuel canister, which will be moved to the fuel pad within the next few days. This is an important milestone for VY transaction as completing this work is a condition to close.  We still target completion of the transaction by year-end. 
Additionally, today we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades to Nuclear Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of Holtec International. With these agreements, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our remaining 4 EWC nuclear sites. This significantly furthers our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility.  The agreement will accelerate decommissioning at both sites. 
Holtec has partnered with SNC-Lavalin group to form Comprehensive Decommissioning International, or CDI, which will complete the decommissioning work. CDI brings significant experience and expertise in decommissioning and site remediation. We are very pleased with this announcement and the incremental clarity it provides for our exit from EWC.
At Indian Point, Unit 2 completed its final refueling outage. That unit is now in its final operating cycle. We are proud of the significant benefits that Unit 2 has provided for its customers and its community. We remain focused on finishing strong until the unit closes in April of 2020.
I'd also like to highlight a few of our other activities and achievements. In June, we received our 29th EEI Award for Emergency Response, following severe winter storms in the Northeast. The work of Entergy's crews to restore power to customers impacted by the Nor'easters is a great example of mutual assistance in action and our industry's commitment to serving customers.
In May, we went to our nation's capital to advocate for low income customers. We helped United Way introduce a nationwide effort to quantify and describe the number of households that are struggling financially. The program is titled ALICE, and represents families who are employed, but have limited assets and limited income.  Helping ALICE families in our communities is an important business imperative for us. As our success is directly tied to prosperity of our communities. As a result of efforts like this, Entergy was once again named 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in the United States.
As I said, at the outset, we had a strong quarter. 2018 has already been a year of significant accomplishments to keep us on track to meet all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives.  At the Utility, we're managing our business to preserve competitive rates for our customers even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan. At EWC, with our announcement to sell Pilgrim and Palisades, we continue to make significant progress towards transitioning to a pure-play utility. Finally, our financial results firmly position us to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.  We look forward to a productive second half of the year. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Drew."
269764,574934987,1516498,"Entergy Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.  In particular, the results for the quarter were strong and keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance a longer-term outlooks. 
While I turn to the results in greater detail, there are 2 items of note for the quarter that I'd like to point out.  First, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. This was a positive outcome and it generated an earnings benefit of $0.31.  Second, as Leo mentioned, our customers started to see benefits from $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT related to tax reform. As a result, the net revenue and income tax lines are complex, and that will continue until customers have received the full benefit of the return.  But remember, these entries offset each other dollar for dollar, so there is no bottom line earnings impact. 
Beyond the accounting, I want to point out that within 6 months of the enactment of tax reform, we achieved sufficient clarity around implementation, such that our customers are already receiving significant benefit.  This accomplishment is a direct result of collaborative efforts with our retail regulators to meet our customers expectation. 
Now turning to results on Slide 4. Operational earnings for Entergy consolidated were $1.32 lower than second quarter 2017. You'll recall that last year's results reflected approximately $2 of income tax benefit at EWC.  This year's results include $0.31 of income tax benefit, $0.24 of which is at UP&O. This is a result of the 2012 and 2013 IRS audit I mentioned a moment ago. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5, adjusted earnings were $0.11 higher than the prior year. Excluding the $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT, net revenue increased as a result of higher unbilled sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas.  Similar to last quarter, regulatory provisions to return benefits of the lower tax rate to customers in Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, partially offset the quarter's increase. 
Other factors included higher non-fuel O&M due largely to powerful average cost as well as energy efficiency and storm reserves, lower income tax expense due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate, and lastly, other drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation and interest expenses.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.14 excluding last year's tax item. The key driver for EWC was higher net revenue due to higher sales volume as a result of fewer outage days in second quarter 2018.  Lower energy pricing somewhat offset this increase. 
Before leaving EWC, I would like to mention a few details regarding the progress of efforts to reduce risk at EWC and transform our company. As Leo said, the Pilgrim and Palisades transaction -- with the Pilgrim and Palisades transactions, we have now solidified plan to fully divest 3 of our 4 remaining EWC nuclear sites. And these transactions support our expectation for EWC to provide a positive net cash to parent through 2022.
Energy sales are approximately 90% hedged for the remaining life of our merchant assets, significantly reducing our revenue risk. We've improved operations through the focus work of our dedicated nuclear employees and expect Pilgrim to return to Column 1 before the plant closes in 2019. And as Leo also mentioned the VY, all the remaining nuclear fuels has been moved from the spent fuel pool and soon be loaded to dry fuel casks for long-term storage.  These collective actions significantly further our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
Turning back to the quarter. Slide 7 shows operating cash flow totaling $523 million, approximately $230 million higher than a year ago. The increase is due to lower nuclear refueling outage spending, lower severance and retention payments at EWC and increased collections of fuel and purchased power costs at Utility. However, return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers partly offset the increase.
Slides 8 and 9 contain our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term Utility, Parent & Other adjusted outlook, both of which we are affirming today. For 2018, we expect results to come in around the midpoint for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted, and in the top half of the range for consolidated operational.  Also, as we mentioned on last quarter's call, our consolidated operational guidance assumes a $100 million favorable tax item at EWC, which we still expect to materialize in the third quarter.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our FFO-to-debt percentage remains at 15.4%, and our parent debt-to-total debt has increased to 24.1%. The increase in parent debt-to-total debt is timing related due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT and capital investment for growth.  This measure should move lower later this year with incremental debt issuances at Utility and realization of a portion of the forward equity sale. We remain committed to our FFO-to-debt target at or above 15% by 2020, our parent debt-to-total-debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to thank you for joining our Analyst Day, even in person or through the webcast. As we demonstrated, we have compelling strategy that translates into strong financial growth and value for our investors. With our capital plan largely ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint and good visibility on our rate base growth, we are confident in our 5% to 7% UP&O adjusted earnings growth trajectory.
Our accomplishments this quarter directly support our plan and objectives, and we're firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

So really just a big focus on making investments that fuel the growth of the business. But as you can see, we continue to be one of the lowest price options as far as the provision electricity in the United States. And we're trying to hold onto that while we grow the business rapidly."

Given that we're coming off of Analyst Day, our remarks today will be brief. The main update is that we had a strong quarter, and we remain on track with all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives. 
As we stated when we saw you in New York, we have a solid capital plan that is largely ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint, with a demonstrated track record of on-time and on-budget performance.  This capital plan will modernize our technology across all functional groups and provide significant value for our customers in service level, sustainability and costs, while fueling growth in our business. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant progress toward transitioning to a pure-play utility as evidenced by our announcement today that we have signed purchase and sale agreements with a subsidiary of Holtec International to sell both Pilgrim and Palisades after their scheduled shutdowns. 
Turning to financial results. We are reporting second quarter Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $1.23 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $1.79. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail. But this quarter's results keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.
At our businesses, we continue to make good progress achieving our goals. Starting with major projects: In Louisiana, the Public Service Commission approved our agreement to purchase Washington Parish Energy Center. Calpine will construct the 361-megawatt facility, which we expect to purchase in 2021.
We also continue to make progress on our 4 new build generation projects. We discussed those in detail at our Analyst Day, and all projects remain on-budget and on-schedule. Yesterday, we issued a full notice to proceed on the Montgomery County Power Station. 
For transmission, our $187 million Lake Charles Transmission Project is nearing completion. Major portions are already in service, providing benefits to our customers.  We are finishing the final major phase of work, replacing the towers and lines that span the Calcasieu River. We expect completion in the third quarter. With approximately 1,000 megawatts in various stages of development, we're committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.
In Arkansas, the Commission approved a new 100-megawatt solar PPA, which includes the Green Pricing Tariff option for Entergy Arkansas' customers. Entergy New Orleans submitted a request to approve 3 renewable projects totaling 90 megawatts of solar generation, including a 20-megawatt PPA, a 20-megawatt self-build and a 50-megawatt acquisition.  The projects would be expected to be in service in the 2020 or 2021 time frame. Entergy New Orleans also included a request in its rate case filing to implement a community solar and a Green Pricing option, and we're evaluating similar offerings in our other jurisdictions.
Turning to nuclear operations. ANO Units 1 and 2 have returned to Column 1 of the NRC's reactor oversight process. This marks the culmination of a comprehensive and dedicated effort by our nuclear team, especially our Arkansas Nuclear One employees. As a result of this hard work, we have improved human performance, equipment reliability and safety culture.
At Grand Gulf, the NRC held an exit conference on June 28. At that meeting, the NRC concluded that the plant had successfully met the objectives for the supplemental inspection. We expect Grand Gulf to transition to Column 1 once the inspection report is issued, which we anticipate later this month.
Turning to regulatory activity. We've been busy with rate proceedings in all 5 of our jurisdictions. We are pleased to note that when combined with the positive resolutions around the implementation of tax reform, we expect our customers to see minimal impacts to the rates over the next few years, even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan.  Specifically, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual FRP. The filing resolved the effects of tax reform, including customer refunds and rate base offsets. And because of the lower federal tax rate, no base rate change was needed. 
In May, Texas submitted its filing requesting a net base rate change of $118 million. In addition, we proposed refunds of unprotected excess ADIT to Entergy Texas customers, which will return approximately $200 million over 2 years.  The net impact to customer rates in the next few years will be $17 million, significantly lower than the base rate impact.
Entergy Louisiana filed its annual FRP in June. Because of the effects of tax reform and costs rolling off the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, customer rates will actually decline over the rate-effective period. 
Entergy Arkansas filed its annual evaluation report in early June -- July. Because of the 4% rate cap, we requested a revenue change of $65 million for 2019. This rate change will be more than offset by the return of $466 million of unprotected excess ADIT through the end of next year.  
And finally, Entergy New Orleans filed its base rate case yesterday, which reflects an expected net decrease of approximately $20 million.
We also requested a formula rate plan for test years 2019 through 2021, and several new customer offerings, such as a prepaid tariff that we intend to launch after AMI is fully deployed, an electric vehicle charging infrastructure tariff and a fixed billing option. These filings are an important piece to achieving our objectives. They're also an illustration of the commitment of our leadership, our employees and our regulators to our customers.
I appreciate our retail regulators timely and constructive review and evaluation, not only of these filings, but on the broader portfolio changes we implemented together in the past several years for the benefit of our customers. We look forward to our continued constructive relationships.
As I just mentioned, in the quarter, customers started to see benefits from tax reform in their bills, which included $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT. More than half of that, a $150 million, was credited to customer bills. The remainder reduced plant balances at Entergy Mississippi. $278 million of benefits in one quarter is impressive, and represents substantial savings for our customers.
At EWC, our proposal to sell Vermont Yankee to NorthStar is still progressing. We are awaiting approvals from the NRC and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. The Vermont Commission has decided to issue its decision regarding the settlement, after the NRC determination is made, which we expect late in the third quarter.
At the plant, all of the remaining nuclear fuel has been removed from the spent fuel pool and loaded into the last dry fuel canister, which will be moved to the fuel pad within the next few days. This is an important milestone for our VY transaction as completing this work is a condition to close.  We still target completion of the transaction by year-end. 
Additionally, today we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades to Nuclear Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of Holtec International. With these agreements, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our remaining 4 EWC nuclear sites. This significantly furthers our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility.  The agreement will accelerate decommissioning at both sites. 
Holtec has partnered with SNC-Lavalin group to form Comprehensive Decommissioning International, or CDI, which will complete the decommissioning work. CDI brings significant experience and expertise in decommissioning and site remediation. We are very pleased with this announcement and the incremental clarity it provides for our exit from EWC.
At Indian Point, Unit 2 completed its final refueling outage. That unit is now in its final operating cycle. We are proud of the significant benefits that Unit 2 has provided for its customers and its community. We remain focused on finishing strong until the unit closes in April of 2020.
I'd also like to highlight a few of our other activities and achievements. In June, we received our 29th EEI Award for Emergency Response, following severe winter storms in the Northeast. The work of Entergy's crews to restore power to customers impacted by the Nor'easter is a great example of mutual assistance in action and our industry's commitment to serving customers.
In May, we went to our nation's capital to advocate for low income customers. We helped United Way introduce a nationwide effort to quantify and describe the number of households that are struggling financially. The program is titled ALICE, and represents families who are employed, but have limited assets and limited income.  Helping ALICE families in our communities is an important business imperative for us. As our success is directly tied to the prosperity of our communities. As a result of efforts like this, Entergy was once again named 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in the United States.
As I said, at the outset, we had a strong quarter. 2018 has already been a year of significant accomplishments to keep us on track to meet all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives.  At the Utility, we're managing our business to preserve competitive rates for our customers even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan. At EWC, with our announcement to sell Pilgrim and Palisades, we continue to make significant progress towards transitioning to a pure-play utility. Finally, our financial results firmly position us to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.  We look forward to a productive second half of the year. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Drew."
269764,574934987,1527298,"Entergy Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.  In particular, the results for the quarter were strong and keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance, and longer-term outlooks. 
While I turn to the results in greater detail, there are 2 items of note for the quarter that I'd like to point out.  First, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. This was a positive outcome and it generated an earnings benefit of $0.31.  Second, as Leo mentioned, our customers started to see benefits from $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT related to tax reform. As a result, the net revenue and income tax lines are complex, and that will continue until customers have received the full benefit of the return.  But remember, these entries offset each other dollar for dollar, so there is no bottom line earnings impact. 
Beyond the accounting, I want to point out that within 6 months of the enactment of tax reform, we achieved sufficient clarity around implementation, such that our customers are already receiving significant benefit.  This accomplishment is a direct result of collaborative efforts with our retail regulators to meet our customer's expectation. 
Now turning to results on Slide 4. Operational earnings for Entergy consolidated were $1.32 lower than second quarter 2017. You'll recall that last year's results reflected approximately $2 of income tax benefit at EWC.  This year's results include $0.31 of income tax benefit, $0.24 of which is at UP&O. This is a result of the 2012 and 2013 IRS audit I mentioned a moment ago. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5, adjusted earnings were $0.11 higher than the prior year. Excluding the $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT, net revenue increased as a result of higher unbilled sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas.  Similar to last quarter, regulatory provisions to return benefits of the lower tax rate to customers in Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, partially offset the quarter's increase. 
Other factors included higher non-fuel O&M due largely to fossil average cost as well as energy efficiency and storm reserves, lower income tax expense due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate, and lastly, other drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation and interest expenses.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.14 excluding last year's tax item. The key driver for EWC was higher net revenue due to higher sales volume as a result of fewer outage days in second quarter 2018.  Lower energy pricing somewhat offset this increase. 
Before leaving EWC, I would like to mention a few details regarding the progress of efforts to reduce risk at EWC and transform our company. As Leo said, the Pilgrim and Palisades transaction -- with the Pilgrim and Palisades transactions, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our 4 remaining EWC nuclear sites. And these transactions support our expectation for EWC to provide a positive net cash to parent through 2022.
Energy sales are approximately 90% hedged for the remaining life of our merchant assets, significantly reducing our revenue risk. We've improved operations through the focus work of our dedicated nuclear employees and expect Pilgrim to return to Column 1 before the plant closes in 2019. And as Leo also mentioned the VY, all the remaining nuclear fuels has been moved from the spent fuel pool and soon be loaded to dry fuel casks for long-term storage.  These collective actions significantly further our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
Turning back to the quarter. Slide 7 shows operating cash flow totaling $523 million, approximately $230 million higher than a year ago. The increase is due to lower nuclear refueling outage spending, lower severance and retention payments at EWC and increased collections of fuel and purchase power costs at Utility. However, return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers partly offset the increase.
Slides 8 and 9 contain our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term Utility, Parent & Other adjusted outlook, both of which we are affirming today. For 2018, we expect results to come in around the midpoint for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted, and in the top half of the range for Consolidated Operational.  Also, as we mentioned on last quarter's call, our consolidated operational guidance assumes a $100 million favorable tax item in EWC, which we still expect to materialize in the third quarter.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our FFO-to-debt percentage remains at 15.4%, and our parent debt-to-total debt has increased to 24.1%. The increase in parent debt-to-total debt is timing related due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT and capital investment for growth.  This measure should move lower later this year with incremental debt issuances at the Utility and realization of a portion of the forward equity sale. We remain committed to our FFO-to-debt target at or above 15% by 2020, and our parent debt-to-total-debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to thank you for joining our Analyst Day, either in person or through the webcast. As we demonstrated, we have compelling strategy that translates into strong financial growth and value for our investors. With our capital plan largely ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint and good visibility on our rate base growth, we are confident in our 5% to 7% UP&O adjusted earnings growth trajectory.
Our accomplishments this quarter directly support our plan and objectives, and we're firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

So really this has given us between all the things Drew mentioned in terms of hedging and the operations, and the sales of these facilities, gives us a lot of capacity financially, operationally, management bandwidth, et cetera, to really focus on the growth of the Utility and the benefits that our customers receive through those types of investments, whether those are the new generating plants that we're building, the renewables that we're putting in place, AMI and whatever comes after that. 
So really just a big focus on making investments that fuel the growth of the business. But as you can see, we continue to be one of the lowest priced options as far as the provision of electricity in the United States. And we're trying to hold onto that while we grow the business rapidly."

Given that we're coming off of Analyst Day, our remarks today will be brief. The main update is that we had a strong quarter, and we remain on track with all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives. 
As we stated when we saw you in New York, we have a solid capital plan that is largely ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint, with a demonstrated track record of on-time and on-budget performance.  This capital plan will modernize our technology across all functional groups and provide significant value for our customers in service level, sustainability and costs, while fueling growth in our business. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant progress toward transitioning to a pure-play utility as evidenced by our announcement today that we have signed purchase and sale agreements with a subsidiary of Holtec International to sell both Pilgrim and Palisades after their scheduled shutdowns. 
Turning to financial results. We are reporting second quarter Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $1.23 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $1.79. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail. But this quarter's results keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.
At our businesses, we continue to make good progress achieving our goals. Starting with major projects: In Louisiana, the Public Service Commission approved our agreement to purchase Washington Parish Energy Center. Calpine will construct the 361-megawatt facility, which we expect to purchase in 2021.
We also continue to make progress on our 4 new build generation projects. We discussed those in detail at our Analyst Day, and all projects remain on-budget and on-schedule. Yesterday, we issued a full notice to proceed on the Montgomery County Power Station. 
For transmission, our $187 million Lake Charles Transmission Project is nearing completion. Major portions are already in service, providing benefits to our customers.  We are finishing the final major phase of work, replacing the towers and lines that span the Calcasieu River. We expect completion in the third quarter. With approximately 1,000 megawatts in various stages of development, we're committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.
In Arkansas, the Commission approved a new 100-megawatt solar PPA, which includes the Green Pricing Tariff option for Entergy Arkansas' customers. Entergy New Orleans submitted a request to approve 3 renewable projects totaling 90 megawatts of solar generation, including a 20-megawatt PPA, a 20-megawatt self-build and a 50-megawatt acquisition.  The projects would be expected to be in service in the 2020 or 2021 time frame. Entergy New Orleans also included a request in its rate case filing to implement a community solar and a Green Pricing option, and we're evaluating similar offerings in our other jurisdictions.
Turning to nuclear operations. ANO Units 1 and 2 have returned to Column 1 of the NRC's reactor oversight process. This marks the culmination of a comprehensive and dedicated effort by our nuclear team, especially our Arkansas Nuclear One employees. As a result of this hard work, we have improved human performance, equipment reliability and safety culture.
At Grand Gulf, the NRC held an exit conference on June 28. At that meeting, the NRC concluded that the plant had successfully met the objectives for the supplemental inspection. We expect Grand Gulf to transition to Column 1 once the inspection report is issued, which we anticipate later this month.
Turning to regulatory activity. We've been busy with rate proceedings in all 5 of our jurisdictions. We are pleased to note that when combined with the positive resolutions around the implementation of tax reform, we expect our customers to see minimal impacts to the rates over the next few years, even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan.  Specifically, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual FRP. The filing resolved the effects of tax reform, including customer refunds and rate base offsets. And because of the lower federal tax rate, no base rate change was needed. 
In May, Texas submitted its filing requesting a net base rate change of $118 million. In addition, we proposed refunds of unprotected excess ADIT to Entergy Texas customers, which will return approximately $200 million over 2 years.  The net impact to customer rates in the next few years will be $17 million, significantly lower than the base rate impact.
Entergy Louisiana filed its annual FRP in June. Because of the effects of tax reform and costs rolling off the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, customer rates will actually decline over the rate-effective period. 
Entergy Arkansas filed its annual evaluation report in early June -- July. Because of the 4% rate cap, we requested a revenue change of $65 million for 2019. This rate change will be more than offset by the return of $466 million of unprotected excess ADIT through the end of next year.  
And finally, Entergy New Orleans filed its base rate case yesterday, which reflects an expected net decrease of approximately $20 million.
We also requested a formula rate plan for test years 2019 through 2021, and several new customer offerings, such as a prepaid tariff that we intend to launch after AMI is fully deployed, an electric vehicle charging infrastructure tariff and a fixed billing option. These filings are an important piece to achieving our objectives. They're also an illustration of the commitment of our leadership, our employees and our regulators to our customers.
I appreciate our retail regulators timely and constructive review and evaluation, not only of these filings, but on the broader portfolio changes we implemented together in the past several years for the benefit of our customers. We look forward to our continued constructive relationships.
As I just mentioned, in the quarter, customers started to see benefits from tax reform in their bills, which included $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT. More than half of that, a $150 million, was credited to customer bills. The remainder reduced plant balances at Entergy Mississippi. $278 million of benefits in one quarter is impressive, and represents substantial savings for our customers.
At EWC, our proposal to sell Vermont Yankee to NorthStar is still progressing. We are awaiting approvals from the NRC and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. The Vermont Commission has decided to issue its decision regarding the settlement, after the NRC determination is made, which we expect late in the third quarter.
At the plant, all of the remaining nuclear fuel has been removed from the spent fuel pool and loaded into the last dry fuel canister, which will be moved to the fuel pad within the next few days. This is an important milestone for our VY transaction as completing this work is a condition to close.  We still target completion of the transaction by year-end. 
Additionally, today we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades to Nuclear Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of Holtec International. With these agreements, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our remaining 4 EWC nuclear sites. This significantly furthers our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility.  The agreement will accelerate decommissioning at both sites. 
Holtec has partnered with SNC-Lavalin group to form Comprehensive Decommissioning International, or CDI, which will complete the decommissioning work. CDI brings significant experience and expertise in decommissioning and site remediation. We are very pleased with this announcement and the incremental clarity it provides for our exit from EWC.
At Indian Point, Unit 2 completed its final refueling outage. That unit is now in its final operating cycle. We are proud of the significant benefits that Unit 2 has provided for its customers and its community. We remain focused on finishing strong until the unit closes in April of 2020.
I'd also like to highlight a few of our other activities and achievements. In June, we received our 29th EEI Award for Emergency Response, following severe winter storms in the Northeast. The work of Entergy's crews to restore power to customers impacted by the Nor'easter is a great example of mutual assistance in action and our industry's commitment to serving customers.
In May, we went to our nation's capital to advocate for low-income customers. We helped United Way introduce a nationwide effort to quantify and describe the number of households that are struggling financially. The program is titled ALICE, and represents families who are employed, but have limited assets and limited income.  Helping ALICE families in our communities is an important business imperative for us. As our success is directly tied to the prosperity of our communities. As a result of efforts like this, Entergy was once again named 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in the United States.
As I said, at the outset, we had a strong quarter. 2018 has already been a year of significant accomplishments to keep us on track to meet all of our strategic, operational and financial objectives.  At the Utility, we're managing our business to preserve competitive rates for our customers even as we implement our solid customer-centric investment plan. At EWC, with our announcement to sell Pilgrim and Palisades, we continue to make significant progress towards transitioning to a pure-play utility. Finally, our financial results firmly position us to achieve our full year guidance and our long-term outlooks.  We look forward to a productive second half of the year. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Drew."
269764,574934987,1527859,"Entergy Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.  In particular, the results for the quarter were strong and keep us firmly on track to a",968,"Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support the plans and objectives we reinforced at Analyst Day.  In particular, the results for the quarter were strong and keep us firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance, and longer-term outlooks. 
While I turn to the results in greater detail, there are 2 items of note for the quarter that I'd like to point out.  First, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. This was a positive outcome and it generated an earnings benefit of $0.31.  Second, as Leo mentioned, our customers started to see benefits from $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT related to tax reform. As a result, the net revenue and income tax lines are complex, and that will continue until customers have received the full benefit of the return.  But remember, these entries offset each other dollar for dollar, so there is no bottom line earnings impact. 
Beyond the accounting, I want to point out that within 6 months of the enactment of tax reform, we achieved sufficient clarity around implementation, such that our customers are already receiving significant benefit.  This accomplishment is a direct result of collaborative efforts with our retail regulators to meet our customer's expectation. 
Now turning to results on Slide 4. Operational earnings for Entergy consolidated were $1.32 lower than second quarter 2017. You'll recall that last year's results reflected approximately $2 of income tax benefit at EWC.  This year's results include $0.31 of income tax benefit, $0.24 of which is at UP&O. This is a result of the 2012 and 2013 IRS audit I mentioned a moment ago. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5, adjusted earnings were $0.11 higher than the prior year. Excluding the $278 million of unprotected excess ADIT, net revenue increased as a result of higher unbilled sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas.  Similar to last quarter, regulatory provisions to return benefits of the lower tax rate to customers in Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, partially offset the quarter's increase. 
Other factors included higher non-fuel O&M due largely to fossil average cost as well as energy efficiency and storm reserves, lower income tax expense due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate, and lastly, other drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation and interest expenses.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.14 excluding last year's tax item. The key driver for EWC was higher net revenue due to higher sales volume as a result of fewer outage days in second quarter 2018.  Lower energy pricing somewhat offset this increase. 
Before leaving EWC, I would like to mention a few details regarding the progress of efforts to reduce risk at EWC and transform our company. As Leo said, the Pilgrim and Palisades transaction -- with the Pilgrim and Palisades transactions, we have now solidified plans to fully divest 3 of our 4 remaining EWC nuclear sites. And these transactions support our expectation for EWC to provide a positive net cash to parent through 2022.
Energy sales are approximately 90% hedged for the remaining life of our merchant assets, significantly reducing our revenue risk. We've improved operations through the focus work of our dedicated nuclear employees and expect Pilgrim to return to Column 1 before the plant closes in 2019. And as Leo also mentioned the VY, all the remaining nuclear fuels has been moved from the spent fuel pool and soon be loaded to dry fuel casks for long-term storage.  These collective actions significantly further our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
Turning back to the quarter. Slide 7 shows operating cash flow totaling $523 million, approximately $230 million higher than a year ago. The increase is due to lower nuclear refueling outage spending, lower severance and retention payments at EWC and increased collections of fuel and purchase power costs at Utility. However, return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers partly offset the increase.
Slides 8 and 9 contain our 2018 earnings guidance ranges and our longer-term Utility, Parent & Other adjusted outlook, both of which we are affirming today. For 2018, we expect results to come in around the midpoint for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted, and in the top half of the range for Consolidated Operational.  Also, as we mentioned on last quarter's call, our consolidated operational guidance assumes a $100 million favorable tax item in EWC, which we still expect to materialize in the third quarter.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our FFO-to-debt percentage remains at 15.4%, and our parent debt-to-total debt has increased to 24.1%. The increase in parent debt-to-total debt is timing related due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT and capital investment for growth.  This measure should move lower later this year with incremental debt issuances at the Utility and realization of a portion of the forward equity sale. We remain committed to our FFO-to-debt target at or above 15% by 2020, and our parent debt-to-total-debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to thank you for joining our Analyst Day, either in person or through the webcast. As we demonstrated, we have compelling strategy that translates into strong financial growth and value for our investors. With our capital plan largely ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint and good visibility on our rate base growth, we are confident in our 5% to 7% UP&O adjusted earnings growth trajectory.
Our accomplishments this quarter directly support our plan and objectives, and we're firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

We now have 3 quarters behind us and we continue to consistently execute on the initiatives that keep us on track to achieve our goals, both near term and longer-term. We've completed most of the 2018 key deliverables we outlined at the beginning of the year and we've added a few more since then. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $2.27 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $3.77. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail, but the bottom line is, that we're raising our consolidated operational guidance range for our UP&O adjusted view we are affirming our 2018 guidance and our longer term outlooks through 2021. 
With the EEI financial conference less than 2 weeks away, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter. Before I go into our accomplishments, I'd to address a couple of news items that were not materially impacting financial results, more of it being addressed. First, on the Mississippi Attorney General Complaint. This is the continuation of litigation that was filed 10 years ago. The matter was set to go to trial in early November, but as you may have heard earlier this week, the trial was continued to sometime next year. The precise date has not been set. We filed 2 separate motions for summary judgment, and last June in the state of Mississippi pass legislation, which clarifies that a claim of this nature should first proceed in front of the NPC before being filed in court. This matter has been disclosed and fairly discussed in our 10-K and 10-Q filings to which I would point you. The important thing for you to take away is that our generation practices are scrutinized, reviewed or audited in multiple jurisdictions on a regular and continuous basis and have been for decades. Claims similar to those brought by the Attorney General related to the Louisiana, New Orleans and Texas. Louisiana commission and city Council both rejected those claims on their merits and the case was dismissed in Texas for lack of jurisdiction. We feel very comfortable about our position in the litigation, and for that reason, do not believe the lawsuit poses a material risk to earnings. 
Second, we received the share Gardner report on the grass routes advocacy practices in New Orleans. We recognized and appreciated the effort undertaking by the city Council to thoroughly review this matter. Nevertheless, we take exception to certain characterizations and key omissions in the report like the written admission that they took these actions without our knowledge. There are no fact support the conclusion that Entergy employees knew about the hiring of crowds on demand for their payments to individuals to show support for the New Orleans powerstation. However, we believe that better oversight and asking the right questions could have either prevented the actions of demand or discovered them and allowed us to stop them. 
We continue our effort to regain the trust and confidence of the citizens of New Orleans and the counsel. 
I'll now turn back to the quarter. With good clarity on our strategy, our accomplishments included a major milestone in our transition to a pure-play utility. The NRC has approved the license transfer of Vermont Yankee to This was a necessary condition in our agreement to sell Vermont Yankee, along with it's deconditioning assets and liability. The decision is also an important milestone for the nuclear decommissioning industry and we are pleased with this outcome and encouraged by the NRC's acceptance of this transaction model. 
The sale of nuclear plants post shutdown will benefit stakeholders and our industry by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience, and laying the foundation for potential future business development opportunities in the regions. We are waiting for decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission, which we requested by November 30. We continue to target completion of the transaction by year-end. 
We're also making progress on our agreement to sell Pilgrim. In September, we attended the NRC's license transfer application pre-submittal meeting with Holtec. We discussed Pilgrim's status and the proposed transaction as well as Holtec's decommissioning strategy and financial and technical qualifications. We plan to submit our file into the NRC before the end of the year. 
We also received renewed operating licenses for Indian Point units 2 and 3, which are scheduled to shut down in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Palisades will close a year later, finalizing the orderly wind down of EWC operations. Our progress at EWC significantly advances our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. We've also continued to make good progress towards modernizing the utilizes generation portfolio. In August, entered Choctaw Generating Station. The plant is a clean and moderate 800 megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine. We expect to close the transaction by the end of 2019 following receipt of regulatory approvals. 
At Analyst Day, we noted that our 5-year capital plan is soon to new build CCGT to meet Entergy Mississippi's capacity requirements. Choctaw will now meet that need. Purchasing the Choctaw facility is more economic than a new build and frees up capital resources are there investments that will also benefit our customers. This is a good example, of opportunities we continue to seek to meet our customers needs at the most economic price point. We'll provide a preliminary update on our 3-year capital plan at the EEI conference. 
We're also making progress on a new build generation projects. Our 3 CCGTs remain on budget and on schedule. We are waiting for an air permit from the state for New Orleans powerstation before we can further proceed. We expect this to result in a 4 to 5 month delay in the plants commercial operation date, but we still anticipate completing the project on budget. We've also made significant progress on key transmission plants. We completed the Lake Charles project, our largest transmission undertaking to date. It included construction of 2 new substations, the expansion of 2 others and added approximately 25 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. The project is providing approval liability and additional load serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth. 
Also, in the quarter, Entergy Louisiana announced that it had signed a long-term agreement to serve Shintech, expanding manufacturing complex in Iberville Parish. Through the project, Shintech will create a 120 new direct jobs. Louisiana economic development estimates an additional 590 new in-direct jobs in result for a total more than 700 new jobs. The expansion is also projected to create up to 3,000 construction jobs at its peak and we expected to come online in early 2021. 
We've also been busy with rate proceedings in many of our jurisdictions. In New Orleans, we refiled our rate case. The changes from the original filing related primarily to rate design a revenue requirement to be requested in our refiling is nearly identical to what we requested in the original filing. With next year's projected fuel savings and energy efficiency, the net rate change to our customers in 2019 is expected to be $20 million decrease. In Texas, we filed an unopposed settlement agreement in our base rate case proceedings. The settlement is a step in the right direction. It provides certainty and will improve earnings and return and result tax the formations in that jurisdiction. We expect to commission to take it up at an upcoming open meeting. 
Nevertheless, the sentiment is less than requested and we will continue to work collaboratively with the commission, the legislature and other stakeholders to explore ways to improve the regulatory construct in Texas. Specifically, we'll ask the commission to review its rules and associated procedures to include appropriate posttest year adjustments. Regulatory mechanisms that better align the timing of cost and investments with the recovery are beneficial for credit ratings, access to capital lower cost customers and infrastructure investments that drive economic development and job creation. 
Yesterday, parties filed a partial settlement agreement in the Arkansas FRP proceedings, resulting all outstanding revenue requirement issues for 2019. The agreement recommends a rate adjustment of approximately $67 million, consistent with the EEI's initial filings. The rate adjustment is based upon a revenue requirement of approximately $163 million, capped at 4% of total filing year revenue. We still expect the decisions from the commission by year-end. This continued progress on regulatory proceedings improves clarity and solidifies our financial commitments. 
At Entergy, safety is a core value and we recently achieved an important milestone. Our transmission group of nearly 1,000 employees achieved 397 days of injury-free performance. This milestone demonstrates that 0 injuries is achievable on a sustained basis. We are proud of this accomplishment. We're thankful to our employees for for the focus, commitment and care they've demonstrated in achieving this outstanding performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Drew, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge who passed away in September. Wayne was a friend and a mentor to many and he was also a true leader. He led our employees and our communities through transformational events like Hurricane Katrina. He took a leadership role and key industry issues, including sustainability and corporate responsibility. He advocated for low-income customers who couldn't speak for themselves and demanded that we do a better job serving the poor. He was a visionary on issues of climate changes in the environment. Although, he tired more than 5 years ago, Wayne's legacy remains deeply woven into the fabric of our company. We set out to sustainable long-term growth by delivering strong financial results to our owners, investing in our employees to create a workforce for the future and proactively establishing policies to be an environmentally and socially responsible growth for our communities, while working to break the cycle of poverty experienced by many of the customers we serve. We never wanted individual between paying for electricity or necessities like groceries or medications. For us, that starts with the controlling electric rates. S&P Global market intelligence studies show that in 2016 and 2017 Entergy provided power to retail customers at the lowest average price of the major investor on utilities in the United States. 
In addition, we advocate for additional and fair funding for our customers from the federal low income home assistance program. financial's pay their utility bills. With the help of our and congressmen, in 2018 an incremental $47 million was directed to 8 residence in the states where we serve. And we've recently learned that the U.S. Senate is recommending an additional $50 million for the program in 2019 with customers in our service territory getting their fair share. 
Today, we operate as much one of the cleanest large-scale generating in the United States. Over the last 3 years, our mission rate across our entire fleet has been more than 40% below the national average and the EPA standard for a new highly efficient combined cycle natural gas unit. This year, we were named for the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability North America index. We are in top scores in the years with policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. Only companies that excel in developing and implementing long-term economic and environmental and social strategies and actions are included on the index. And we're the only U.S. elected utility to be named to the world or North American index or both for 17 straight years. It is no coincidence that this recognition goes back to the time when Wayne's and Entergy's greenhouse missions commitment they have seemed an unrealistic goal. 
Our investors are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental and sustainability responsibilities. Financial results are inexplicably tied to good corporate citizenship, acting with concern for safety, the environment, employees, communities, customers and owners is what makes Entergy a sound investment. We're proud of our legacy of leadership in these areas. 
We have made a lot of progress, but there is still a lot to do. To further our goals improving communities, we've incorporated the UN sustainable development goals into a social responsibility business plan and strategy. We will also continue to work with our local partners, such as the United Way to help families achieve economic stability, jobs for America's graduates to create a scale ready and diverse workforce for the communities we serve, resources to fund cost of restoration and the power to care to provide bill payment assistance for elderly and disabled customers. I encourage you to learn more about our efforts and track record on ESG issues through our integrated report, which we publish annually. 
The fundamentals of our business are strong. 2018 has already been another year of significant accomplishments, including major milestones to keep us on track to achieve our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our accomplishments this quarter are in many ways simply a continuation of the path Wayne setup for us many years ago. The part to become a lower-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders. The path where our successes now remeasured in delivering shareholder returns, but also leaving behind a better world, we're doing good is good business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more details on our financial results and also approval of what we are planning for EEI. We look forward to seeing you at the conference."

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic operational and financial objectives. Our results were strong, with consolidated operational earnings of $3.77 per share and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share. At the Utility, the fundamentals of our business are healthy. We are seeing the effects of productive investment on the behalf of our customers in the lower tax rate. We also had positive effects of weather year-over-year. At EWC, we saw good returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the third quarter and as we've communicated, favorable tax benefits. Overall, operational earnings to date are better than we expected. Therefore, we are raising our 2018 Entergy operational guidance, while our core utility patent and other businesses is firmly on track to achieve the 2018 guidance and longer term outlooks. 
Breaking down results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings, which normalized weather and taxes were $0.12 higher than the prior year. Setting aside offsetting line items, we saw a lower retail sales volume in the unbilled period. This was partially offset by higher than expected weather adjusted bill sales, and positive rate actions in Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas. Finally, nonfuel O&M was higher as planned due largely to fossil spending and contract costs. 
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6, operational earnings were $1.42. Excluding this quarter's tax items, the key driver was higher returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Lower nuclear pricing as well as nuclear sales volume partially offset the increase. This quarter, as reported earnings -- as reported earnings include $110 million of a revision to Pilgrim's asset retirement obligation. From an updated decommissioning study. The revision resulted in an asset impairment, which is treated as a special items and excluded from our operational earnings. 
Before leaving EWC, I would like to update our cash expectation. We expect EWC to provide positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. This remains a key focus area as we transition to a pure-play utility. 
Turning back to the quarter, Slide 7, shows operating cash flow totaling $780 million, $113 million lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the return of $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which we expected. At this point, all of our customers are seeing the positive effects from tax reform in their bills. Roughly half of this was offset by solid weather as well as increased collections for fuel and purchase panel cost recovery at the utiliy. In addition, lower net revenue at EWC and planned spending on the Vermont Yankee activities contributed to the decrease. 
Now turning to Slide 8 and 9, because of the strong results today, we are updating our consolidated operational guidance range of $6.75 to $7.25. This reflects a midpoint increase of $0.45 and the narrowing of the range. The primary drivers are strong weather to date and better than planned income tax outcomes. We're also assuming a tax item at the utility, which we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. But today, this quarter, the tax item is essentially offset by mark-to-market returns on the EWC nuclear decommissioning trust funds. We're also affirming our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance range, which we still expect to come around the midpoint. There are a few key drivers that I'd like to highlight. 
We're seeing stronger-than-expected sales year-to-date. And as a result, we now expect positive growth for the year of about 0.5% versus our previous assumption of negative 0.7%. Nevertheless, we expect this to be partially offset by a settlement in the Texas rate case, which includes a $0.10 refund -- $0.10 per share refund to customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive to January of this year. Because Entergy Texas has a historical test year and has been under earning, we did not assume this our companies that our guidance earlier this year. We expect this refund to affect 2018 results and as reflected in our current midpoint expectations for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. And in to the extent, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi continued to perform above our expectations, such that future true-up's will result in amounts to back to customers, we would accrue those this year. 
We're also affirming our long-term Utility, Parent & Other outlooks through 2021. You'll see that our outlook is unchanged from Analyst Day just a few months ago. 
Switching gears a bit regarding our outlooks. For the past few years, we're focused on 2 earnings measures, Entergy operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted view have helped us reinforce our focus on transitioning to a pure-play utility and held us account for the quarter results of the utility business. However, now that we've been successful with our strategy, having 2 measures may no longer be warranted. Over the next few months, we've been evaluating our earnings measures and disclosures to address feedback we've received from the investment community, including the volatility from March tax items and EWC reporting. At this point, we can't treat EWC as discontinued operations from a GAAP perspective. We've recognized that the time is right to guide you on a simple measure that better reflects our current business profile. We plan to provide a further update on the fourth quarter call. 
Moving to our credit metrics, shown on Slide 10. Our FFO to debt percentage is lower at 13.1% and our parent debt to total debt has increased to 24.5%. In the third quarter, our customers continue to receive the significant benefits of tax reform, including the $256 million of unprotected excess ADIT I mentioned earlier. This brings the year-to-date total to $342 million. We expect FFO to debt to move a little over over the next few quarters as continue to return and estimated $640 million of remaining unprotected excess ADIT cash to customers. But beginning next quarter, we project an improvement in parent debt to total debt as we complete incremental debt issuances at utility and setting the portion of equity forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to our FFO to debt target at or above 15% by 2020, and our parent debt to total debt at or below 25%. 
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to reinforce that the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're firmly on track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer term outlooks. We've executed on the majority of our business objectives for the year, including major milestones in the wind down of EWC. At the EEI, we plan to provide a preview of a few key considerations for 2019. We also plan to provide a preliminary 3-year capital plan. We're excited about where we stand as a company and we're looking forward to continuing this conversation at the year. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Obviously, that's actually when we had identified the Mississippi need at that point. If you think about the generation that we have, we will still continue to need to refresh that as we get through time, we still have significant amount of legacy generation that we can replace with new or more modern, more efficient better environmental footprint type of stuff. But as we also mentioned there is a dynamic up renewables battery storage becoming the economic and competitive with and that's why as we've announced in the past, we've got 1,000 megawatts of renewable under development at the moment. So we continue to look at ways to test out battery storage either as we have it with our New Orleans solar facility right now or even on grid and other areas where it would be useful for us to have battery storage. This is not necessarilyé on the backup of generation, but some to me the T&D needs of the system. But as you might recall also when we are at Analyst Day, we started to talk a lot more about grid modernization and where we could go for customer facing types of investments, so we see that picking up as well, really in addition to in postEMI, we should have a significant amount of investment where devices that give us more information about the grid, give us more capability to do things remotely, give us a little bit better troubleshooting capability and all that. In addition to how we manage information and data analytics to go to our customers. So I guess, the bottom line is, we continue to have a lot of a traditional investment, particular given the growth in the service territory, but you should see more and more of our investment start to pick up on the P&D side as well as we put together more of a grid modernization package. So the bottom line is, we are wanting for capital expenditure ideas. We're just managing those with one of the things most bank for a buck for our customers that continue to keep us as the lowest price utility in the United States and to continue to improve reliability all  managing all of those at the same time, with the keen eye on where we're going from an environmental footprint standpoint. Each one of those new power plants that add, adds a new resource that's significantly, more environmentally friendly that we want to replace. Certainly we would go renewables and battery storage more and more and that will improve our environmental footprint. And then, as Drew mentioned, AMI and some of these other technologies will get us in a mode to actually drive our customer usage in a way that we're producing such that we've got lower emissions as well. So a lot of win-win opportunities out there as technology starts to improve."

And so, our current anticipation is that when you complete the Pilgrim process by the end of next year, the Palisades process, of course, won't commence until 2022. But if you would expect some time second half of 2022 is whenever we would be able to close that particular half of the transaction."

We now have 3 quarters behind us, and we continue to consistently execute on the initiatives that keep us on track to achieve our goals, both near term and longer term. We've completed most of the 2018 key deliverables we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we've added a few more since then. 
We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $2.27 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $3.77. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail, but the bottom line is, that we're raising our consolidated operational guidance range. For our UP&O adjusted view, we are affirming our 2018 guidance and our longer-term outlooks through 2021. With the EEI Financial Conference less than 2 weeks away, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter. 
Before I go into our accomplishments, I'd to address a couple of news items that while not materially impacting financial results weren't being addressed. First, on the Mississippi Attorney General complaint. This is the continuation of litigation that was filed 10 years ago. The matter was set to go to trial in early November, but as you may have heard earlier this week, the trial was continued to sometime next year. The precise date has not been set. We filed 2 separate motions for summary judgment, and last June, the State of Mississippi passed legislation, which clarifies that a claim of this nature should first proceed in front of the NPSE before being filed in court. This matter has been disclosed and thoroughly discussed in our 10-K and 10-Q filings to which I would point you. The important thing for you to takeaway is that our generation practices are scrutinized, reviewed or audited in multiple jurisdictions on a regular and continuous basis and have been for decades. Claims similar to those brought by the Attorney General were alleged in Louisiana, New Orleans and Texas. Louisiana commission and City Council both rejected those claims on their merits, and the case was dismissed in Texas for lack of jurisdiction. We feel very comfortable about our position in the litigation, and for that reason, do not believe the lawsuit poses a material risk to earnings. 
Second, we received the shared Gartner report on the grassroots advocacy practices in New Orleans. We recognized and appreciate the effort undertaking by the City Council to thoroughly review this matter. Nevertheless, we take exception to certain characterizations and key omissions in the report, like the Hawthorn Group's written admission that they took these actions without our knowledge. There are no facts that support the conclusion that Entergy employees knew about the hiring of crowds on demand or their payments to individuals to show support for the New Orleans power station. However, we believe that better oversight and asking the right questions could have either prevented the actions of Hawthorn and crowds on demand or discovered them and allowed us to stop them. We continue our effort to regain the trust and confidence of the citizens of New Orleans and the Council.
I will now turn back to the quarter. With good clarity on our strategy, our accomplishments included a major milestone in our transition to a pure-play utility. The NRC has approved the license transfer of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. This was a necessary condition in our agreement to sell Vermont Yankee along with it's decommissioning assets and liability. The decision is also an important milestone for the nuclear decommissioning industry, and we are pleased with this outcome and encouraged by the NRC's acceptance of this transaction model. The sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown will benefit stakeholders and our industry by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for potential future business development opportunities in the regions. We are awaiting a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission, which we requested by November 30. We continue to target completion of the transaction by year-end.
We're also making progress on our agreement to sell Pilgrim. In September, we attended the NRC's license transfer application pre-submittal meeting with Holtec. We discussed Pilgrim's status and the proposed transaction as well as Holtec's decommissioning strategy and financial and technical qualifications. We plan to submit our filing to the NRC before the end of the year. We also received renewed operating licenses for Indian Point units 2 and 3, which are scheduled to shut down in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Palisades will close a year later, finalizing the orderly wind down of EWC operations. Our progress at EWC significantly advances our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
We've also continue to make good progress towards modernizing the utilities generation portfolio. In August, Entergy Mississippi agreed to acquire Choctaw Generating Station. The plant is a clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine. We expect to close the transaction by the end of 2019 following receipt of regulatory approvals. At Analyst Day, we noted that our 5-year capital plan assumed a new build CCGT to meet Entergy Mississippi's capacity requirements. Choctaw will now meet that need. Purchasing the Choctaw facility is more economic than a new build and frees up capital resources or other investments that will also benefit our customers. This is a good example, of opportunities we continue to seek to meet our customers needs at the most economic price point. We'll provide a preliminary update on our 3-year capital plan at the EEI Conference. 
We're also making progress on our new build generation projects. Our 3 CCGTs remain on budget and on schedule. We're awaiting for an air permit from the state for the New Orleans power station before we can further proceed. We expect this to result in a 4- to 5-month delay in the plants commercial operation date, but we still anticipate completing the project on budget. We've also made significant progress on key transmission plants. We completed the Lake Charles project, our largest transmission undertaking to date. It included construction of 2 new substations, expansion of 2 others and added approximately 25 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. The project is providing improved liability and additional load serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth.
Also, in the quarter, Entergy Louisiana announced that it had signed a long-term agreement to serve Shintech's expanding manufacturing complex in Iberville Parish. Through the project, Shintech will create 120 new direct jobs. Louisiana economic development estimates an additional 590 new indirect jobs will result for a total of more than 700 new jobs. The expansion is also projected to create up to 3,000 construction jobs at its peak, and we expect it to come online in early 2021.
We've also been busy with rate proceedings in many of our jurisdictions. In New Orleans, we refiled our rate case. The changes from the original filing related primarily to rate design and a revenue requirement request in our refiling is nearly identical to what we requested in the original filing. With next year's projected fuel savings and energy efficiency, the net rate change to our customers in 2019 is expected to be a $20 million decrease. In Texas, we filed an unopposed settlement agreement in our rate -- our base rate case proceeding. The settlement is a step in the right direction. It provides certainty and will improve earnings and return and resolve tax the reform issues in that jurisdiction. We expect the commission to take it up at an upcoming open meeting. Nevertheless, the settlement is less than we requested, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the commission, the legislature and other stakeholders to explore ways to improve the regulatory construct in Texas. Specifically, we'll ask the commission to review its rules and associated procedures to include appropriate post-test year adjustments. Regulatory mechanisms that better align the timing of cost and investments with their recovery are beneficial for credit ratings, access to capital at a lower cost to customers and infrastructure investments that drive economic development and job creation. Yesterday, parties filed a partial settlement agreement in the Arkansas FRP proceedings resolving all outstanding revenue requirements issues for 2019. The agreement recommends a rate adjustment of approximately $67 million consistent with EAI's initial filings. The rate adjustment is based upon a revenue requirement of approximately $163 million capped at 4% of total filing year revenue. We still expect a decision from the commission by year-end. This continued progress on regulatory proceedings improves clarity and solidifies our financial commitments.
At Entergy, safety is a core value, and we recently achieved an important milestone. Our transmission group of nearly 1,000 employees achieved 397 days of injury-free performance. This milestone demonstrates that 0 injuries is achievable on a sustained basis. We're proud of this accomplishment. We're thankful to our employees for the focus, commitment and care they have demonstrated in achieving this outstanding performance.
Before I turn the call over to Drew, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Wayne Leonard who passed away in September. Wayne was a friend and a mentor to many and he was also a true leader. He led our employees and our communities through transformational events like Hurricane Katrina. He took a leadership role in key industry issues, including sustainability and corporate responsibility. He advocated for low-income customers who couldn't speak for themselves and demanded that we do a better job serving the poor. He was a visionary on issues of climate changes in the environment. Although, he retired more than 5 years ago, Wayne's legacy remains deeply woven into the fabric of our company. We set out to drive sustainable long-term growth by delivering strong financial results to our owners, investing in our employees to create a workforce for the future and proactively establishing policies to be an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for our communities, while working to break the cycle of poverty experienced by many of the customers we serve. We never wanted individuals that have to choose between paying for electricity or necessities like groceries or medications. For us, that starts with controlling electric rates. S&P Global Market Intelligence studies show that in 2016 and 2017, Entergy provided power to retail customers at the lowest average price of the major investor-owned in the United States. In addition, we advocate for additional and fair funding for our customers from the Federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP helps customers in dire financial circumstances pay their utility bills. With the help of our senators and congressmen, in 2018 an incremental $47 million was directed to 8 residents in the states where we serve. And we've recently learned that the U.S. Senate is recommending an additional $50 million for the program in 2019 with customers in our service territory getting their fair share.
Today, we operate as much one of the cleanest large-scale generating fleets in the United States. Over the last 3 years, our mission rate across our entire fleet has been more than 40% below the national average and the EPA standard for a new highly efficient combined cycle natural gas unit. This year, we were named to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We earned top scores in the areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. Only companies that excel in developing and implementing long-term economic, environmental and social strategies and actions are included on the index. And we're the only U.S. electric utility to be named to the world or North American index or both for 17 straight years. It is no coincidence that this recognition goes back to the time when Wayne's and Entergy's greenhouse emissions commitment may have seemed an unrealistic goal. Our investors are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental and sustainability responsibilities. Financial results are inexplicably tied to good corporate citizenship, acting with concern for safety, the environment, employees, communities, customers and owners is what makes Entergy a sound investment. We're proud of our legacy of leadership in these areas.
We have made a lot of progress, but there is still a lot to do. To further our goal of improving communities, we have incorporated the UN sustainable development goals into our social responsibility, business plan and strategy. We will also continue to work with our local partners, such as the United Way to help families achieve economic stability, jobs for America's graduates to create a skill, ready and diverse workforce for the communities we serve, [ to have ] resources to fund coastal restoration and the power to care to provide bill payment assistance for elderly and disabled customers. I encourage you to learn more about our efforts and track record on ESG issues through our integrated report, which we publish annually.
The fundamentals of our business are strong. 2018 has already been another year of significant accomplishments, including major milestones to keep us on track to achieve our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our accomplishments this quarter are in many ways simply a continuation of the path Wayne set out for us many years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders, a path where our success is not only remeasured in delivering shareholder returns, but also in leaving behind a better world, we're doing good is good business.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew, who'll provide more details on our financial results and also a preview of what we are planning for EEI. We look forward to seeing you at the conference."

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic, operational and financial objectives.

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our results were strong with consolidated operational earnings of $3.77 per share and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share. At the Utility, the fundamentals of our business are healthy. We are seeing the effects of productive investment on behalf of our customers and the lower tax rate. We also had positive effects of weather year-over-year. At EWC, we saw good returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the third quarter and as we've communicated, favorable tax benefits. Overall, operational earnings to date are better than we expected. Therefore, we are raising our 2018 Entergy operational guidance while our core Utility, Patent & Other business is firmly on track to achieve its 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings, which normalized weather and taxes, were $0.12 higher than the prior year. Setting aside offsetting line items, we saw a lower retail sales volume in the unbilled period. This was partially offset by higher-than-expected weather adjusted bill sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas. Finally, nonfuel O&M was higher as planned due largely to fossil spending and contract costs.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $1.42. Excluding this quarter's tax items, the key driver was higher returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Lower nuclear pricing as well as nuclear sales volume partially offset the increase. This quarter, as reported earnings -- as reported earnings included $110 million upward revision to Pilgrim's asset retirement obligation from an updated decommissioning study. The revision resulted in an asset impairment, which is treated as special item and excluded from our operational earnings. Before leaving EWC, I would like to update our cash expectation. We expect EWC to provide positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. This remains a key focus area as we transition to a pure-play utility.
Turning back to the quarter, Slide 7, shows operating cash flow totaling $780 million, $113 million lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the return of $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which we expected. At this point, all of our customers are seeing the positive effects from tax reform in their bills. Roughly half of this was offset by solid weather as well as increased collections for fuel and purchase power cost recovery at the utility. In addition, lower net revenue at EWC and planned spending on Vermont Yankee decommissioning activities contributed to the decrease.
Now turning to Slide 8 and 9. Because of our strong results to date, we're updating our consolidated operational guidance range of $6.75 to $7.25. This reflects a midpoint increase of $0.45 and a narrowing of the range. The primary drivers are strong weather to date and better-than-planned income tax outcomes. We're also assuming a tax item at the utility, which we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. But to date, this quarter, the tax item is essentially offset by mark-to-market returns on the EWC nuclear decommissioning trusts. We're also affirming our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance range, which we still expect to come around the midpoint. There are a few key drivers that I'd like to highlight. We've seen stronger-than-expected sales year-to-date, and as a result, we now expect positive growth for the year of about 0.5% versus our previous assumption of negative 0.7%. Nevertheless, we expect this to be partially offset by our settlement in the Texas rate case, which includes a $0.10 refund -- $0.10 per share refund to customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive to January of this year. Because Entergy Texas has a historical test year and has been under earning, we did not assume this outcome when we set our guidance earlier this year. We expect this refund to affect 2018 results and is reflected in our current midpoint expectations for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. And to the extent, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi continue to perform above our expectations, such that future true-up's would result in amounts due back to customers, we would accrue those this year. 
We're also affirming our long-term Utility, Parent & Other outlook through 2021. You'll see that our outlook is unchanged from Analyst Day just a few months ago.
Switching gears a bit regarding our outlooks. For the past few years, we have focused on 2 earnings measures, Entergy operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted view have helped us reinforce our focus on transitioning to a pure-play utility and has held us accountable to the quarter results of the utility business. However, now that we've been successful with our strategy, having 2 measures may no longer be warranted. Over the next few months, we'll be evaluating our earnings measures and disclosures to address feedback we've received from the investment community, including the volatility from large tax items and EWC reporting. While at this point, we can't treat EWC as discontinued operations from a GAAP perspective, we recognize that the time is right to guide you on a simpler measure that better reflects our current business profile. We plan to provide a further update on the fourth quarter call. 
Moving to our credit metrics, shown on Slide 10. Our FFO to debt percentage is lower at 13.1% and our parent debt to total debt has increased to 24.5%. In the third quarter, our customers continue to receive the significant benefits of tax reform, including the $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT I mentioned earlier. This brings the year-to-date total to $342 million. We expect FFO to debt to move a little over, over the next few quarters as we continue to return an estimated $640 million of remaining unprotected excess ADIT cash to customers. But beginning next quarter, we project an improvement in parent debt to total debt as we complete incremental debt issuances at utility and settle a portion of the equity forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to our FFO to debt target at or above 15% by 2020 and our parent debt to total debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to reinforce that the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are firmly on track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. We have executed on the majority of our business objectives for the year, including major milestones and the wind down of EWC. At the EEI, we plan to provide a preview of a few key considerations for 2019. We also plan to provide a preliminary 3-year capital plan. We're excited about where we stand as a company, and we're looking forward to continuing this conversation at EEI. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Obviously, that's actually when we had identified the Mississippi need at that point. If you think about the generation that we have, we will still continue to need to refresh that as we get through time, we still have significant amount of legacy generation that we can replace with newer, more modern, more efficient better environmental footprint type of stuff. But as we also mentioned there is a dynamic of renewables battery storage becoming economic and competitive with central station generation, and that's why as we've announced in the past, we've got 1,000 megawatts renewable under development at the moment, and we continue to look at ways to test out battery storage either as we have it with our New Orleans solar facility right now or even on grid and other areas where it would be useful for us to have battery storage. That's not necessarily only for the backup of generation, but some, to me, the T&D needs of the system. But as you might recall also when we were at Analyst Day, we started to talk a lot more about grid modernization and where we could go with customer-facing types of investments, so we see that picking up as well, really in addition to and post-AMI, we should have a significant amount of investment where devices that give us more information about the grid, give us more capability to do things remotely, give us a little bit better troubleshooting capability and all that. In addition to how we manage information and data and analytics that go to our customers. So I guess, the bottom line is, we continue to have a lot of the traditional investment, particularly given the growth in the service territory, but you should see more and more of our investment start to pick up on the T&D side as well as we put together more of a grid modernization package. So the bottom line is, we are wanting for capital expenditure ideas. We're just managing those with what are the things that give us the most bang for a buck for our customers that continue to keep us as the lowest priced utility in the United States and to continue to improve our reliability all -- managing all of those at the same time, with a keen eye on where we're going from an environmental footprint standpoint. Each one of those new power plants that we add, adds a new resource that's significantly, more environmentally friendly than we want to replace. Certainly, when we go to renewables and battery storage more and more, that will improve our environmental footprint. And then, as Drew mentioned, AMI and some of these other technologies will get us in a mode to actually be able to drive our customer usage in a way that we're producing less such that we've got lower emissions as well. So a lot of win-win opportunities out there as technology starts to improve."

We now have 3 quarters behind us, and we continue to consistently execute on the initiatives that keep us on track to achieve our goals, both near term and longer term. We've completed most of the 2018 key deliverables we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we've added a few more since then. 
We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $2.27 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $3.77. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail, but the bottom line is, that we're raising our consolidated operational guidance range. For our UP&O adjusted view, we are affirming our 2018 guidance and our longer-term outlooks through 2021. With the EEI Financial Conference less than 2 weeks away, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter. 
Before I go into our accomplishments, I'd to address a couple of news items that while not materially impacting financial results weren't being addressed. First, on the Mississippi Attorney General complaint. This is the continuation of litigation that was filed 10 years ago. The matter was set to go to trial in early November, but as you may have heard earlier this week, the trial was continued to sometime next year. The precise date has not been set. We filed 2 separate motions for summary judgment, and last June, the State of Mississippi passed legislation, which clarifies that a claim of this nature should first proceed in front of the NPSE before being filed in court. This matter has been disclosed and thoroughly discussed in our 10-K and 10-Q filings to which I would point you. The important thing for you to takeaway is that our generation practices are scrutinized, reviewed or audited in multiple jurisdictions on a regular and continuous basis and have been for decades. Claims similar to those brought by the Attorney General were alleged in Louisiana, New Orleans and Texas. Louisiana commission and City Council both rejected those claims on their merits, and the case was dismissed in Texas for lack of jurisdiction. We feel very comfortable about our position in the litigation, and for that reason, do not believe the lawsuit poses a material risk to earnings. 
Second, we received the shared Gartner report on the grassroots advocacy practices in New Orleans. We recognized and appreciate the effort undertaking by the City Council to thoroughly review this matter. Nevertheless, we take exception to certain characterizations and key omissions in the report, like the Hawthorn Group's written admission that they took these actions without our knowledge. There are no facts that support the conclusion that Entergy employees knew about the hiring of crowds on demand or their payments to individuals to show support for the New Orleans power station. However, we believe that better oversight and asking the right questions could have either prevented the actions of Hawthorn and Crowds on Demand or discovered them and allowed us to stop them. We continue our effort to regain the trust and confidence of the citizens of New Orleans and the Council.
I will now turn back to the quarter. With good clarity on our strategy, our accomplishments included a major milestone in our transition to a pure-play utility. The NRC has approved the license transfer of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. This was a necessary condition in our agreement to sell Vermont Yankee along with it's decommissioning assets and liability. The decision is also an important milestone for the nuclear decommissioning industry, and we are pleased with this outcome and encouraged by the NRC's acceptance of this transaction model. The sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown will benefit stakeholders and our industry by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for potential future business development opportunities in the regions. We are awaiting a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission, which we requested by November 30. We continue to target completion of the transaction by year-end.
We're also making progress on our agreement to sell Pilgrim. In September, we attended the NRC's license transfer application pre-submittal meeting with Holtec. We discussed Pilgrim's status and the proposed transaction as well as Holtec's decommissioning strategy and financial and technical qualifications. We plan to submit our filing to the NRC before the end of the year. We also received renewed operating licenses for Indian Point units 2 and 3, which are scheduled to shut down in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Palisades will close a year later, finalizing the orderly wind down of EWC operations. Our progress at EWC significantly advances our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
We've also continue to make good progress towards modernizing the utilities generation portfolio. In August, Entergy Mississippi agreed to acquire Choctaw Generating Station. The plant is a clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine. We expect to close the transaction by the end of 2019 following receipt of regulatory approvals. At Analyst Day, we noted that our 5-year capital plan assumed a new build CCGT to meet Entergy Mississippi's capacity requirements. Choctaw will now meet that need. Purchasing the Choctaw facility is more economic than a new build and frees up capital resources or other investments that will also benefit our customers. This is a good example, of opportunities we continue to seek to meet our customers needs at the most economic price point. We'll provide a preliminary update on our 3-year capital plan at the EEI Conference. 
We're also making progress on our new build generation projects. Our 3 CCGTs remain on budget and on schedule. We're awaiting for an air permit from the state for the New Orleans power station before we can further proceed. We expect this to result in a 4- to 5-month delay in the plants commercial operation date, but we still anticipate completing the project on budget. We've also made significant progress on key transmission plants. We completed the Lake Charles project, our largest transmission undertaking to date. It included construction of 2 new substations, expansion of 2 others and added approximately 25 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. The project is providing improved liability and additional load serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth.
Also, in the quarter, Entergy Louisiana announced that it had signed a long-term agreement to serve Shintech's expanding manufacturing complex in Iberville Parish. Through the project, Shintech will create 120 new direct jobs. Louisiana economic development estimates an additional 590 new indirect jobs will result for a total of more than 700 new jobs. The expansion is also projected to create up to 3,000 construction jobs at its peak, and we expect it to come online in early 2021.
We've also been busy with rate proceedings in many of our jurisdictions. In New Orleans, we refiled our rate case. The changes from the original filing related primarily to rate design and a revenue requirement request in our refiling is nearly identical to what we requested in the original filing. With next year's projected fuel savings and energy efficiency, the net rate change to our customers in 2019 is expected to be a $20 million decrease. In Texas, we filed an unopposed settlement agreement in our rate -- our base rate case proceeding. The settlement is a step in the right direction. It provides certainty and will improve earnings and return and resolve tax the reform issues in that jurisdiction. We expect the commission to take it up at an upcoming open meeting. Nevertheless, the settlement is less than we requested, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the commission, the legislature and other stakeholders to explore ways to improve the regulatory construct in Texas. Specifically, we'll ask the commission to review its rules and associated procedures to include appropriate post-test year adjustments. Regulatory mechanisms that better align the timing of cost and investments with their recovery are beneficial for credit ratings, access to capital at a lower cost to customers and infrastructure investments that drive economic development and job creation. Yesterday, parties filed a partial settlement agreement in the Arkansas FRP proceedings resolving all outstanding revenue requirements issues for 2019. The agreement recommends a rate adjustment of approximately $67 million consistent with EAI's initial filings. The rate adjustment is based upon a revenue requirement of approximately $163 million capped at 4% of total filing year revenue. We still expect a decision from the commission by year-end. This continued progress on regulatory proceedings improves clarity and solidifies our financial commitments.
At Entergy, safety is a core value, and we recently achieved an important milestone. Our transmission group of nearly 1,000 employees achieved 397 days of injury-free performance. This milestone demonstrates that 0 injuries is achievable on a sustained basis. We're proud of this accomplishment. We're thankful to our employees for the focus, commitment and care they have demonstrated in achieving this outstanding performance.
Before I turn the call over to Drew, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Wayne Leonard who passed away in September. Wayne was a friend and a mentor to many and he was also a true leader. He led our employees and our communities through transformational events like Hurricane Katrina. He took a leadership role in key industry issues, including sustainability and corporate responsibility. He advocated for low-income customers who couldn't speak for themselves and demanded that we do a better job serving the poor. He was a visionary on issues of climate changes in the environment. Although, he retired more than 5 years ago, Wayne's legacy remains deeply woven into the fabric of our company. We set out to drive sustainable long-term growth by delivering strong financial results to our owners, investing in our employees to create a workforce for the future and proactively establishing policies to be an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for our communities, while working to break the cycle of poverty experienced by many of the customers we serve. We never wanted individuals to have to choose between paying for electricity or necessities like groceries or medications. For us, that starts with controlling electric rates. S&P Global Market Intelligence studies show that in 2016 and 2017, Entergy provided power to retail customers at the lowest average price of the major investor-owned in the United States. In addition, we advocate for additional and fair funding for our customers from the Federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP helps customers in dire financial circumstances pay their utility bills. With the help of our senators and congressmen, in 2018 an incremental $47 million was directed to aid residents in the states where we serve. And we've recently learned that the U.S. Senate is recommending an additional $50 million for the program in 2019 with customers in our service territory getting their fair share.
Today, we operate as much one of the cleanest large-scale generating fleets in the United States. Over the last 3 years, our mission rate across our entire fleet has been more than 40% below the national average and the EPA standard for a new highly efficient combined cycle natural gas unit. This year, we were named to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We earned top scores in the areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. Only companies that excel in developing and implementing long-term economic, environmental and social strategies and actions are included on the index. And we're the only U.S. electric utility to be named to the world or North American index or both for 17 straight years. It is no coincidence that this recognition goes back to the time when Wayne's and Entergy's greenhouse emissions commitment may have seemed an unrealistic goal. Our investors are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental and sustainability responsibilities. Financial results are inexplicably tied to good corporate citizenship, acting with concern for safety, the environment, employees, communities, customers and owners is what makes Entergy a sound investment. We're proud of our legacy of leadership in these areas.
We have made a lot of progress, but there is still a lot to do. To further our goal of improving communities, we have incorporated the UN sustainable development goals into our social responsibility, business plan and strategy. We will also continue to work with our local partners, such as the United Way to help families achieve economic stability, jobs for America's graduates to create a skilled, ready and diverse workforce for the communities we serve, Tierra Resources to fund coastal restoration and the power to care to provide bill payment assistance for elderly and disabled customers. I encourage you to learn more about our efforts and track record on ESG issues through our integrated report, which we publish annually.
The fundamentals of our business are strong. 2018 has already been another year of significant accomplishments, including major milestones to keep us on track to achieve our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our accomplishments this quarter are in many ways simply a continuation of the path Wayne set out for us many years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders, a path where our success is not only remeasured in delivering shareholder returns, but also in leaving behind a better world, where doing good is good business.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew, who'll provide more details on our financial results and also a preview of what we are planning for EEI. We look forward to seeing you at the conference."

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic, operational and financial objectives.

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our results were strong with consolidated operational earnings of $3.77 per share and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share. At the Utility, the fundamentals of our business are healthy. We are seeing the effects of productive investment on behalf of our customers and the lower tax rate. We also had positive effects of weather year-over-year. At EWC, we saw good returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the third quarter and as we've communicated, favorable tax benefits. Overall, operational earnings to date are better than we expected. Therefore, we are raising our 2018 Entergy operational guidance while our core Utility, Patent & Other business is firmly on track to achieve its 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings, which normalized weather and taxes, were $0.12 higher than the prior year. Setting aside offsetting line items, we saw a lower retail sales volume in the unbilled period. This was partially offset by higher-than-expected weather adjusted billed sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas. Finally, nonfuel O&M was higher as planned due largely to fossil spending and contract costs.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $1.42. Excluding this quarter's tax items, the key driver was higher returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Lower nuclear pricing as well as nuclear sales volume partially offset the increase. This quarter, as reported earnings -- as reported earnings included $117 million upward revision to Pilgrim's asset retirement obligation from an updated decommissioning study. The revision resulted in an asset impairment, which is treated as special item and excluded from our operational earnings. Before leaving EWC, I would like to update our cash expectation. We expect EWC to provide positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. This remains a key focus area as we transition to a pure-play utility.
Turning back to the quarter, Slide 7, shows operating cash flow totaling $780 million, $113 million lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the return of $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which we expected. At this point, all of our customers are seeing the positive effects from tax reform in their bills. Roughly half of this was offset by solid weather as well as increased collections for fuel and purchase power cost recovery at the utility. In addition, lower net revenue at EWC and planned spending on Vermont Yankee decommissioning activities contributed to the decrease.
Now turning to Slide 8 and 9. Because of our strong results to date, we're updating our consolidated operational guidance range of $6.75 to $7.25. This reflects a midpoint increase of $0.45 and a narrowing of the range. The primary drivers are strong weather to date and better-than-planned income tax outcomes. We're also assuming a tax item at the utility, which we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. But to date, this quarter, the tax item is essentially offset by mark-to-market returns on the EWC nuclear decommissioning trusts. We're also affirming our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance range, which we still expect to come around the midpoint. There are a few key drivers that I'd like to highlight. We've seen stronger-than-expected sales year-to-date, and as a result, we now expect positive growth for the year of about 0.5% versus our previous assumption of negative 0.7%. Nevertheless, we expect this to be partially offset by our settlement in the Texas rate case, which includes a $0.10 refund -- $0.10 per share refund to customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive to January of this year. Because Entergy Texas has a historical test year and has been under earning, we did not assume this outcome when we set our guidance earlier this year. We expect this refund to affect 2018 results and is reflected in our current midpoint expectations for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. And to the extent, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi continue to perform above our expectations, such that future true-up's would result in amounts due back to customers, we would accrue those this year. 
We're also affirming our long-term Utility, Parent & Other outlook through 2021. You'll see that our outlook is unchanged from Analyst Day just a few months ago.
Switching gears a bit regarding our outlooks. For the past few years, we have focused on 2 earnings measures, Entergy operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted view have helped us reinforce our focus on transitioning to a pure-play utility and has held us accountable to the quarter results of the utility business. However, now that we've been successful with our strategy, having 2 measures may no longer be warranted. Over the next few months, we'll be evaluating our earnings measures and disclosures to address feedback we've received from the investment community, including the volatility from large tax items and EWC reporting. While at this point, we can't treat EWC as discontinued operations from a GAAP perspective, we recognize that the time is right to guide you on a simpler measure that better reflects our current business profile. We plan to provide a further update on the fourth quarter call. 
Moving to our credit metrics, shown on Slide 10. Our FFO to debt percentage is lower at 13.1% and our parent debt to total debt has increased to 24.5%. In the third quarter, our customers continue to receive the significant benefits of tax reform, including the $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT I mentioned earlier. This brings the year-to-date total to $342 million. We expect FFO to debt to move a little over, over the next few quarters as we continue to return an estimated $640 million of remaining unprotected excess ADIT cash to customers. But beginning next quarter, we project an improvement in parent debt to total debt as we complete incremental debt issuances at utility and settle a portion of the equity forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to our FFO to debt target at or above 15% by 2020 and our parent debt to total debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to reinforce that the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are firmly on track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. We have executed on the majority of our business objectives for the year, including major milestones and the wind down of EWC. At the EEI, we plan to provide a preview of a few key considerations for 2019. We also plan to provide a preliminary 3-year capital plan. We're excited about where we stand as a company, and we're looking forward to continuing this conversation at EEI. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Obviously, that's actually when we had identified the Mississippi need at that point. If you think about the generation that we have, we will still continue to need to refresh that as we get through time, we still have significant amount of legacy generation that we can replace with newer, more modern, more efficient better environmental footprint type of stuff. But as we also mentioned there is a dynamic of renewables battery storage becoming economic and competitive with central station generation, and that's why as we've announced in the past, we've got 1,000 megawatts renewable under development at the moment, and we continue to look at ways to test out battery storage either as we have it with our New Orleans solar facility right now or even on grid and other areas where it would be useful for us to have battery storage. That's not necessarily only for the backup of generation, but some, to me, the T&D needs of the system. But as you might recall also when we were at Analyst Day, we started to talk a lot more about grid modernization and where we could go with customer-facing types of investments, so we see that picking up as well, really in addition to and post-AMI, we should have a significant amount of investment where devices that give us more information about the grid, give us more capability to do things remotely, give us a little bit better troubleshooting capability and all that. In addition to how we manage information and data and analytics that go to our customers. So I guess, the bottom line is, we continue to have a lot of the traditional investment, particularly given the growth in the service territory, but you should see more and more of our investment start to pick up on the T&D side as well as we put together more of a grid modernization package. So the bottom line is, we are wanting for capital expenditure ideas. We're just managing those with what are the things that give us the most bang for a buck for our customers that continue to keep us as the lowest priced utility in the United States and to continue to improve our reliability all -- managing all of those at the same time, with a keen eye on where we're going from an environmental footprint standpoint. Each one of those new power plants that we add, adds a new resource that's significantly, more environmentally friendly than we want to replace. Certainly, when we go to renewables and battery storage more and more, that will improve our environmental footprint. And then, as Drew mentioned, AMI and some of these other technologies will get us in a mode to actually be able to drive our customer usage in a way that we're producing less such that we've got lower emissions as well. So a lot of win-win opportunities out there as technology starts to improve."

We now have 3 quarters behind us, and we continue to consistently execute on the initiatives that keep us on track to achieve our goals, both near term and longer term. We've completed most of the 2018 key deliverables we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we've added a few more since then. 
We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $2.27 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $3.77. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail, but the bottom line is, that we're raising our consolidated operational guidance range. For our UP&O adjusted view, we are affirming our 2018 guidance and our longer-term outlooks through 2021. With the EEI Financial Conference less than 2 weeks away, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter. 
Before I go into our accomplishments, I'd to address a couple of news items that while not materially impacting financial results weren't being addressed. First, on the Mississippi Attorney General complaint. This is the continuation of litigation that was filed 10 years ago. The matter was set to go to trial in early November, but as you may have heard earlier this week, the trial was continued to sometime next year. The precise date has not been set. We filed 2 separate motions for summary judgment, and last June, the State of Mississippi passed legislation, which clarifies that a claim of this nature should first proceed in front of the NPSE before being filed in court. This matter has been disclosed and thoroughly discussed in our 10-K and 10-Q filings to which I would point you. The important thing for you to takeaway is that our generation practices are scrutinized, reviewed or audited in multiple jurisdictions on a regular and continuous basis and have been for decades. Claims similar to those brought by the Attorney General were alleged in Louisiana, New Orleans and Texas. Louisiana commission and City Council both rejected those claims on their merits, and the case was dismissed in Texas for lack of jurisdiction. We feel very comfortable about our position in the litigation, and for that reason, do not believe the lawsuit poses a material risk to earnings. 
Second, we received the shared Gartner report on the grassroots advocacy practices in New Orleans. We recognized and appreciate the effort undertaking by the City Council to thoroughly review this matter. Nevertheless, we take exception to certain characterizations and key omissions in the report, like the Hawthorn Group's written admission that they took these actions without our knowledge. There are no facts that support the conclusion that Entergy employees knew about the hiring of crowds on demand or their payments to individuals to show support for the New Orleans power station. However, we believe that better oversight and asking the right questions could have either prevented the actions of Hawthorn and Crowds on Demand or discovered them and allowed us to stop them. We continue our effort to regain the trust and confidence of the citizens of New Orleans and the Council.
I will now turn back to the quarter. With good clarity on our strategy, our accomplishments included a major milestone in our transition to a pure-play utility. The NRC has approved the license transfer of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. This was a necessary condition in our agreement to sell Vermont Yankee along with its decommissioning assets and liability. The decision is also an important milestone for the nuclear decommissioning industry, and we are pleased with this outcome and encouraged by the NRC's acceptance of this transaction model. The sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown will benefit stakeholders and our industry by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for potential future business development opportunities in the regions. We are awaiting a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission, which we requested by November 30. We continue to target completion of the transaction by year-end.
We're also making progress on our agreement to sell Pilgrim. In September, we attended the NRC's license transfer application pre-submittal meeting with Holtec. We discussed Pilgrim's status and the proposed transaction as well as Holtec's decommissioning strategy and financial and technical qualifications. We plan to submit our filing to the NRC before the end of the year. We also received renewed operating licenses for Indian Point units 2 and 3, which are scheduled to shut down in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Palisades will close a year later, finalizing the orderly wind down of EWC operations. Our progress at EWC significantly advances our strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
We've also continue to make good progress towards modernizing the utilities generation portfolio. In August, Entergy Mississippi agreed to acquire Choctaw Generating Station. The plant is a clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine. We expect to close the transaction by the end of 2019 following receipt of regulatory approvals. At Analyst Day, we noted that our 5-year capital plan assumed a new build CCGT to meet Entergy Mississippi's capacity requirements. Choctaw will now meet that need. Purchasing the Choctaw facility is more economic than a new build and frees up capital resources or other investments that will also benefit our customers. This is a good example, of opportunities we continue to seek to meet our customers’ needs at the most economic price point. We'll provide a preliminary update on our 3-year capital plan at the EEI Conference. 
We're also making progress on our new build generation projects. Our 3 CCGTs remain on budget and on schedule. We're awaiting for an air permit from the state for the New Orleans power station before we can further proceed. We expect this to result in a 4- to 5-month delay in the plants commercial operation date, but we still anticipate completing the project on budget. We've also made significant progress on key transmission plants. We completed the Lake Charles project, our largest transmission undertaking to date. It included construction of 2 new substations, expansion of 2 others and added approximately 25 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. The project is providing improved liability and additional load serving capability in an area that is experiencing significant industrial growth.
Also, in the quarter, Entergy Louisiana announced that it had signed a long-term agreement to serve Shintech's expanding manufacturing complex in Iberville Parish. Through the project, Shintech will create 120 new direct jobs. Louisiana economic development estimates an additional 590 new indirect jobs will result for a total of more than 700 new jobs. The expansion is also projected to create up to 3,000 construction jobs at its peak, and we expect it to come online in early 2021.
We've also been busy with rate proceedings in many of our jurisdictions. In New Orleans, we refiled our rate case. The changes from the original filing related primarily to rate design and a revenue requirement request in our refiling is nearly identical to what we requested in the original filing. With next year's projected fuel savings and energy efficiency, the net rate change to our customers in 2019 is expected to be a $20 million decrease. In Texas, we filed an unopposed settlement agreement in our rate -- our base rate case proceeding. The settlement is a step in the right direction. It provides certainty and will improve earnings and return and resolve tax the reform issues in that jurisdiction. We expect the commission to take it up at an upcoming open meeting. Nevertheless, the settlement is less than we requested, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the commission, the legislature and other stakeholders to explore ways to improve the regulatory construct in Texas. Specifically, we'll ask the commission to review its rules and associated procedures to include appropriate post-test year adjustments. Regulatory mechanisms that better align the timing of cost and investments with their recovery are beneficial for credit ratings, access to capital at a lower cost to customers and infrastructure investments that drive economic development and job creation. Yesterday, parties filed a partial settlement agreement in the Arkansas FRP proceedings resolving all outstanding revenue requirements issues for 2019. The agreement recommends a rate adjustment of approximately $67 million consistent with EAI's initial filings. The rate adjustment is based upon a revenue requirement of approximately $163 million capped at 4% of total filing year revenue. We still expect a decision from the commission by year-end. This continued progress on regulatory proceedings improves clarity and solidifies our financial commitments.
At Entergy, safety is a core value, and we recently achieved an important milestone. Our transmission group of nearly 1,000 employees achieved 397 days of injury-free performance. This milestone demonstrates that 0 injuries is achievable on a sustained basis. We're proud of this accomplishment. We're thankful to our employees for the focus, commitment and care they have demonstrated in achieving this outstanding performance.
Before I turn the call over to Drew, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Wayne Leonard who passed away in September. Wayne was a friend and a mentor to many and he was also a true leader. He led our employees and our communities through transformational events like Hurricane Katrina. He took a leadership role in key industry issues, including sustainability and corporate responsibility. He advocated for low-income customers who couldn't speak for themselves and demanded that we do a better job serving the poor. He was a visionary on issues of climate changes in the environment. Although, he retired more than 5 years ago, Wayne's legacy remains deeply woven into the fabric of our company. We set out to drive sustainable long-term growth by delivering strong financial results to our owners, investing in our employees to create a workforce for the future and proactively establishing policies to be an environmentally and socially responsible growth engine for our communities, while working to break the cycle of poverty experienced by many of the customers we serve. We never wanted individuals to have to choose between paying for electricity or necessities like groceries or medications. For us, that starts with controlling electric rates. S&P Global Market Intelligence studies show that in 2016 and 2017, Entergy provided power to retail customers at the lowest average price of the major investor-owned in the United States. In addition, we advocate for additional and fair funding for our customers from the Federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP helps customers in dire financial circumstances pay their utility bills. With the help of our senators and congressmen, in 2018 an incremental $47 million was directed to aid residents in the states where we serve. And we've recently learned that the U.S. Senate is recommending an additional $50 million for the program in 2019 with customers in our service territory getting their fair share.
Today, we operate as much one of the cleanest large-scale generating fleets in the United States. Over the last 3 years, our mission rate across our entire fleet has been more than 40% below the national average and the EPA standard for a new highly efficient combined cycle natural gas unit. This year, we were named to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We earned top scores in the areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. Only companies that excel in developing and implementing long-term economic, environmental and social strategies and actions are included on the index. And we're the only U.S. electric utility to be named to the world or North American index or both for 17 straight years. It is no coincidence that this recognition goes back to the time when Wayne's and Entergy's greenhouse emissions commitment may have seemed an unrealistic goal. Our investors are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental and sustainability responsibilities. Financial results are inexplicably tied to good corporate citizenship, acting with concern for safety, the environment, employees, communities, customers and owners is what makes Entergy a sound investment. We're proud of our legacy of leadership in these areas.
We have made a lot of progress, but there is still a lot to do. To further our goal of improving communities, we have incorporated the UN sustainable development goals into our social responsibility, business plan and strategy. We will also continue to work with our local partners, such as the United Way to help families achieve economic stability, jobs for America's graduates to create a skilled, ready and diverse workforce for the communities we serve, Tierra Resources to fund coastal restoration and the power to care to provide bill payment assistance for elderly and disabled customers. I encourage you to learn more about our efforts and track record on ESG issues through our integrated report, which we publish annually.
The fundamentals of our business are strong. 2018 has already been another year of significant accomplishments, including major milestones to keep us on track to achieve our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our accomplishments this quarter are in many ways simply a continuation of the path Wayne set out for us many years ago, a path to become a world-class utility that prospers by creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders, a path where our success is not only remeasured in delivering shareholder returns, but also in leaving behind a better world, where doing good is good business.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew, who'll provide more details on our financial results and also a preview of what we are planning for EEI. We look forward to seeing you at the conference."

As Leo mentioned, our accomplishments this quarter directly support our strategic, operational and financial objectives. Our results were strong with consolidated operational earnings of $3.77 per share and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share. At the Utility, the fundamentals of our business are healthy. We are seeing the effects of productive investment on behalf of our customers and the lower tax rate. We also had positive effects of weather year-over-year. At EWC, we saw good returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the third quarter and as we've communicated, favorable tax benefits. Overall, operational earnings to date are better than we expected. Therefore, we are raising our 2018 Entergy operational guidance while our core Utility, Patent & Other business is firmly on track to achieve its 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
Breaking down the results, starting with Utility, Parent & Other on Slide 5. Adjusted earnings, which normalized weather and taxes, were $0.12 higher than the prior year. Setting aside offsetting line items, we saw a lower retail sales volume in the unbilled period. This was partially offset by higher-than-expected weather adjusted billed sales and positive rate actions at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas. Finally, nonfuel O&M was higher as planned due largely to fossil spending and contract costs.
Moving to EWC's results on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $1.42. Excluding this quarter's tax items, the key driver was higher returns on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Lower nuclear pricing as well as nuclear sales volume partially offset the increase. This quarter, as reported earnings -- as reported earnings included $117 million upward revision to Pilgrim's asset retirement obligation from an updated decommissioning study. The revision resulted in an asset impairment, which is treated as special item and excluded from our operational earnings. Before leaving EWC, I would like to update our cash expectation. We expect EWC to provide positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. This remains a key focus area as we transition to a pure-play utility.
Turning back to the quarter, Slide 7, shows operating cash flow totaling $780 million, $113 million lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the return of $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which we expected. At this point, all of our customers are seeing the positive effects from tax reform in their bills. Roughly half of this was offset by solid weather as well as increased collections for fuel and purchase power cost recovery at the utility. In addition, lower net revenue at EWC and planned spending on Vermont Yankee decommissioning activities contributed to the decrease.
Now turning to Slide 8 and 9. Because of our strong results to date, we're updating our consolidated operational guidance range of $6.75 to $7.25. This reflects a midpoint increase of $0.45 and a narrowing of the range. The primary drivers are strong weather to date and better-than-planned income tax outcomes. We're also assuming a tax item at the utility, which we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. But to date, this quarter, the tax item is essentially offset by mark-to-market returns on the EWC nuclear decommissioning trusts. We're also affirming our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance range, which we still expect to come around the midpoint. There are a few key drivers that I'd like to highlight. We've seen stronger-than-expected sales year-to-date, and as a result, we now expect positive growth for the year of about 0.5% versus our previous assumption of negative 0.7%. Nevertheless, we expect this to be partially offset by our settlement in the Texas rate case, which includes a $0.10 refund -- $0.10 per share refund to customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive to January of this year. Because Entergy Texas has a historical test year and has been under earning, we did not assume this outcome when we set our guidance earlier this year. We expect this refund to affect 2018 results and is reflected in our current midpoint expectations for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. And to the extent, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi continue to perform above our expectations, such that future true-up's would result in amounts due back to customers, we would accrue those this year. 
We're also affirming our long-term Utility, Parent & Other outlook through 2021. You'll see that our outlook is unchanged from Analyst Day just a few months ago.
Switching gears a bit regarding our outlooks. For the past few years, we have focused on 2 earnings measures, Entergy operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted view have helped us reinforce our focus on transitioning to a pure-play utility and has held us accountable to the quarter results of the utility business. However, now that we've been successful with our strategy, having 2 measures may no longer be warranted. Over the next few months, we'll be evaluating our earnings measures and disclosures to address feedback we've received from the investment community, including the volatility from large tax items and EWC reporting. While at this point, we can't treat EWC as discontinued operations from a GAAP perspective, we recognize that the time is right to guide you on a simpler measure that better reflects our current business profile. We plan to provide a further update on the fourth quarter call. 
Moving to our credit metrics, shown on Slide 10. Our FFO to debt percentage is lower at 13.1% and our parent debt to total debt has increased to 24.5%. In the third quarter, our customers continue to receive the significant benefits of tax reform, including the $266 million of unprotected excess ADIT I mentioned earlier. This brings the year-to-date total to $342 million. We expect FFO to debt to move a little over, over the next few quarters as we continue to return an estimated $640 million of remaining unprotected excess ADIT cash to customers. But beginning next quarter, we project an improvement in parent debt to total debt as we complete incremental debt issuances at utility and settle a portion of the equity forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to our FFO to debt target at or above 15% by 2020 and our parent debt to total debt at or below 25%.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to reinforce that the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are firmly on track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer-term outlooks. We have executed on the majority of our business objectives for the year, including major milestones and the wind down of EWC. At the EEI, we plan to provide a preview of a few key considerations for 2019. We also plan to provide a preliminary 3-year capital plan. We're excited about where we stand as a company, and we're looking forward to continuing this conversation at EEI. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Obviously, that's actually when we had identified the Mississippi need at that point. If you think about the generation that we have, we will still continue to need to refresh that as we get through time, we still have significant amount of legacy generation that we can replace with newer, more modern, more efficient better environmental footprint type of stuff. But as we also mentioned there is a dynamic of renewables battery storage becoming economic and competitive with central station generation, and that's why as we've announced in the past, we've got 1,000 megawatts renewable under development at the moment, and we continue to look at ways to test out battery storage either as we have it with our New Orleans solar facility right now or even on grid and other areas where it would be useful for us to have battery storage. That's not necessarily only for the backup of generation, but some, to me, the T&D needs of the system. But as you might recall also when we were at Analyst Day, we started to talk a lot more about grid modernization and where we could go with customer-facing types of investments, so we see that picking up as well, really in addition to and post-AMI, we should have a significant amount of investment where devices that give us more information about the grid, give us more capability to do things remotely, give us a little bit better troubleshooting capability and all that. In addition to how we manage information and data and analytics that go to our customers. So I guess, the bottom line is, we continue to have a lot of the traditional investment, particularly given the growth in the service territory, but you should see more and more of our investment start to pick up on the T&D side as well as we put together more of a grid modernization package. So the bottom line is, we are wanting for capital expenditure ideas. We're just managing those with what are the things that give us the most bang for a buck for our customers that continue to keep us as the lowest priced utility in the United States and to continue to improve our reliability all -- managing all of those at the same time, with a keen eye on where we're going from an environmental footprint standpoint. Each one of those new power plants that we add, adds a new resource that's significantly, more environmentally friendly than we want to replace. Certainly, when we go to renewables and battery storage more and more, that will improve our environmental footprint. And then, as Drew mentioned, AMI and some of these other technologies will get us in a mode to actually be able to drive our customer usage in a way that we're producing less such that we've got lower emissions as well.

In the operational IT kind of area where we talk about AMI and our new systems and distribution automation that kind of stuff, we're anticipating spending around $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion associated with that through the entire program. Now a little bit of that has been spent in '18. A lot of the meters, which probably make up $700 million, $800 million of it are going to start to roll out in January and be through '21. And then, we're going to also start to pick up distribution automation in that same time frame. So we have a significant amount of spending that we have identified. And then we also have some of the build on transfers like the new 800 megawatts of solar that we have proposed in New Orleans and so forth. So there is some of it in our capital plan right now, but as we have said, there is a lot more to go."

But on that front, for many, many years, you've had a very successful ability to bring in earnings through tax and while that's created a lot of volatility, it's created value. How deep of a well should we assume you have? I mean, there must be a finite opportunity to go back and work with the IRS and the states to improve your tax positions pro forma.
