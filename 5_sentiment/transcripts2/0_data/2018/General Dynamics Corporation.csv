We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings fro",2526,"Good morning. We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax position. 
Adjusting to exclude the impact of this one-time event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year-ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this on Exhibit A and B of our press release. 
I suspect you'll see a lot more of this as other aerospace and defense companies report you've already seen in other market segments. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all around. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $30.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. 
Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on 130-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7% as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the Tax Reform Act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year, leading us well positioned for 2018. 
Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was a $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow is going to be approximately 100% in net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed a $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at land systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. 
We have a lot to cover this morning including guidance, so I will review their year in the quarter as adjusted on a year-over-year basis for the group, so that reference to the sequential comparison. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we have more revenue and lower operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all 4 quarters. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1 point --  $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%. The result of a 220-basis-points improvement in operating margin. For the full year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on 160 point improvement in operating margins.  In sum, an outstanding year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly on the fourth quarter. 
This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1 to 19.2. At year end, we had higher margins on somewhat lower revenue, driven entirely by negligible preowned aircraft sales. By the way, we worked really hard to avoid preowned sales because they carry no margin. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1.3 to $1 denominated and 1.4 to 1 in units. 
Let me give you some additional data on this subject as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsized orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second best quarter for the G650 and 650ER since in orders terms since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders led by the 650 and the 650ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. 
During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively at long-range cruise of 0.8 mark at 0.9 mark, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increase ranges were improving during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. 
And by the way, we announced increases only when we are certain they can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leaves me to another subject. I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which has held up very well in a slow market. We have clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject if they become available. 
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2% and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
For the full year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80-basis-point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. 
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue, and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. 
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of 1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter was 975 million, part of the 2.4 billion IDIQ type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. 
Internationally, demand remains good. We signed a $1 billion contract for combat wheeled vehicles with Romania earlier this month, and the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. 
In our U.S. market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicles and munitions businesses. Fueling are 0.9:1 book-to-bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth and continued history of strong operating leverage. 
For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge of Bath Iron Works, which we discussed with you last quarter. 
Revenue for the full year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. 
Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on 120-basis-point improvement in operating margin. So better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. 
At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. So revenue was 104 million than forecast, but operating earnings at $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. 
In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we are investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. 
We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trade. Over the last 2 years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. 
We are also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago on 110-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of 110-basis-point improvement operating margin, very good operating performance. 
Recall that at this time last year, we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40-basis-point higher-margin rate. 
As we have frequently pointed out, IS&T book-to-bill has been at or in excess of 1:1 for each of the past 4 years, resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog into revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The combination of this ER and new administration slowed the pace of awards, particularly in our sub business. While both the has since picked up during the second half of this year, we simply did not have enough time before year end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2017 to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We round up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but we're at the high-end of our operating earnings expectation because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. 
So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some outyear commentary on 2019 through 2021 initially by business group and then a company-wide rollout. 
In Aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mixed shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which again carry no margin. In Aerospace for the 5-year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a model sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mixed shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 at the low point in earnings during the transition to our new model with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7% very similar to last year. 
For the period of 2017 to '21, we expect the sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion of $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between -- to be at $735 million to $745 million, with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine grew from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over the last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. 
For 2018 company-wide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017. Operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. 
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax position and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much less like last year, meeting our EPS guidance must from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective capital deployment. 
With respect to the quarterly progression for VPS, divide our guidance into 4 and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and Q3 and add $0.45 to Q4. 
For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This is simply a roll up of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. 
Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,549366125,1373001,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject of getting a lot of attention and the impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 3",602,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject of getting a lot of attention and the impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. 
Our tax rate was 36.9% for the quarter and 28.6% for the full year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects the lower statutory rate on domestic income, the elimination of historic benefits such as the domestic production credit and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S. operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history with a relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S. statutory rate. 
As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefit from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future options exercises, so we'll update our tax rate as they occur. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $115 million. 
We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents of $1 billion. That's down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. 
As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. 
Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion. 
On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares, bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017, and we've also made several acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plants in 2017 as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. 
Redevelopment potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next 2 years this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period and think about the transition in 2 pieces. One, that we've been living through for the last 2 years where we're bringing down 450, 550 production and to offset any earnings declined as a result of that, we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing somewhat the 650 production, which we have done in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning. All of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttle transition where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and ultimately, very low rate production, we're feathering back from 650 as appropriate and as we told you we would and in the advent of the 600 comes on board. 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track, we're very much on track in exactly the progressions, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we have been in.

So between those opportunities that will match up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to, the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plans, the free cash flow conversion could end up approaching 100%. If not 100%, we continue to target that range, but call it still in the 90s. We will achieve 100% in 2017 even beyond our original expectations, but we're back structurally in that range. And so I think that's how you think of it. But we'll probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number of events more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D, and so on, to support the growth of the business. And they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid-90s to the 100% range, depending on where those ultimately end up. All opportunities for growth in the business."

Typically, we can cover a relatively short-term CR rather wholesomely, and this year was a little bit different and I could get into that if you wish. But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying lengths of the CR. So it will be, and I believe, better shape and we're comfortable that we're in better shape this year than we have extended CR than we were last year. just to give you a little bit of color what happened later last year, in particular, with IS&T, which let's talk about the short type of businesses tend to be more effective by a CR, but typically, we can cover that. In '17, we have a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that we'll reinforce that the best preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn't get in '17 and moved into '18. But in addition to the CR, we had a number of new army start-ups, which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both CDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stop funding when T and some other related comps programs until they completed their network and battlefield reviews. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted, but that's been addressed by our customers and fed sales as they've modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to in the IS&T sales."

Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year-ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in Exhibit A and B of our press release. I suspect you'll see a lot more of this as other aerospace and defense companies report, as you've already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all around. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $30.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7%, as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax reform act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year, leaving us well positioned for 2018. 
Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was a $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow is going to be approximately 100% of net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed a $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance. So I will review the year in the quarter, as adjusted, on a year-over-year basis for the group, so that reference to the sequential comparison. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue and lower operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all 4 quarters. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1 point -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%, the result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1% to 19.2%. At year-end, we had higher margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible preowned aircraft sales. By the way, we worked really hard to avoid preowned sales because they carry no margin. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book to bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1.3:$1 denominated and 1.4:1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on this subject as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsized orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second-best quarter for the G650 and 650ER since -- in order terms, since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders, led by the 650 and the 650ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. 
During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively, at long-range cruise of 0.8 Mach. At 0.9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way, we announced increases only when we are certain they can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leaves me to another subject. 
I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which has held up very well in a slow market. We have clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject, if they become available. 
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue, and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. 
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ-type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally, demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion contract for combat wheeled vehicles with Romania earlier this month. And the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S. market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle and munitions businesses, fueling our 0.9:1 book to bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with -- and continued history of strong operating leverage. 
For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge at Bath Iron Works, which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASSCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on 120 basis point improvement in operating margin, so better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings at $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. 
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance, requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. Over the last 2 years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We are also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago on 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of 110 basis point improvement operating margin, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher-margin rate. 
As we have frequently pointed out, IS&T book to bill has been at or in excess of 1:1 for each of the past 4 years, resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog into revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The culmination of this ER and a new administration slowed the pace of awards, particularly in our fed civ business. While both defense and fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We round up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but we're at the high end of our operating earnings expectation because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. 
So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out-year commentary on 2019 through 2021, initially by business group and then a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mixed shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, carry no margin. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 at the low point in earnings during the transition to our new model with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7%, very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion, a $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between -- to be at $735 million to $745 million with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. 
So for 2018 company-wide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax position and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into 4 and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and 3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. 
Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,549366125,1373119,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.",603,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9% for the quarter and 28.6% for the full year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate, as required under generally accepted accounting principles. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects: the lower statutory rate on domestic income; the elimination of historic benefits, such as the domestic production credit; and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S. operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history where the relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S. statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefits from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future options exercises. So we'll update our tax rate as they occur. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you'll recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $115 million. 
We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents, of $1 billion. That's down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion.  
On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares, bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017. And we've also made several acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plan in 2017, as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We'll examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments, and happily and officiously, we have a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive and in our core, and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we've talked about this for many years, the only long-term, steady, reliable, repeatable element of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and ,in the case of tax reform, provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event."

So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next 2 years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period. And think about the transition in 2 pieces, one that we've been living through for the last 2 years, where we're bringing down 450, 550 production, and to offset the -- any earnings decline as a result of that, we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing, somewhat, the 650 production, which we have done, in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning. All of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition, where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and, ultimately, very low rate production, we're feathering back from 650, as appropriate and as we told you we would, in the advent of the 600 comes onboard, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track. We're very much on track in exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we have been in. We never discussed our R&D. But again, suffice it to say that it has been robust, and it will continue to be robust going forward."

What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities, including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities, across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to, the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plans, the free cash flow conversion could end up approaching 100%. If not 100%, we continue to target that range, but, call it, still in the 90s. We well exceeded 100% in 2017, even beyond our original expectations, but we're back structurally in that range. And so I think that's how you think of it. But we'll probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that's more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D and so on, to support the growth of the business. And they can -- they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid-90s to the 100% range, depending on where those ultimately end up. All opportunities for growth in the business."

Typically, we can cover a relatively short-term CR rather wholesomely, and this year was a little bit different. And I can get into that if you wish. But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying lengths of the CR. So we'll be in, I believe, better shape, and we're comfortable that we're in better shape this year with an extended CR than we were last year. Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about it. The short-cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR. But typically, we can cover that. In '17, we has a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that -- or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn't get in '17 and moved into '18. But in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army start-ups, which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield reviews. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales."

I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses, because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical on a hot war. The tactical forces receive the preponderance of the funding, and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict, then the strategic forces, which, in our case, is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both. We need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we have in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years, over a decade, of the consumption of its material. But it needs to not only replace, but upgrade that material, and they put the money behind it. So I like -- I think we're well balanced.

We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax position. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this onetime event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year-ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in Exhibit A and B of our press release. I suspect you'll see a lot more of this as other aerospace and defense companies report, as you've already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all around. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $30.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7%, as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax reform act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year, leaving us well positioned for 2018. 
Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was a $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow is going to be approximately 100% of net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed a $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance. So I will review the year in the quarter, as adjusted, on a year-over-year basis for the group, so that reference to the sequential comparison. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue and lower operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all 4 quarters. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1 point -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%, the result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1% to 19.2%. At year-end, we had higher margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible preowned aircraft sales. By the way, we worked really hard to avoid preowned sales because they carry no margin. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book to bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1.3:$1 denominated and 1.4:1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on this subject as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsized orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second-best quarter for the G650 and 650ER since -- in order terms, since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders, led by the 650 and the 650ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. 
During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively, at long-range cruise of 0.8 Mach. At 0.9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way, we announced increases only when we are certain they can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leaves me to another subject. 
I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which has held up very well in a slow market. We have clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject, if they become available. 
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue, and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. 
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ-type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally, demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion contract for combat wheeled vehicles with Romania earlier this month. And the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S. market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle and munitions businesses, fueling our 0.9:1 book to bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with -- and continued history of strong operating leverage. 
For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge at Bath Iron Works, which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASSCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on 120 basis point improvement in operating margin, so better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings at $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. 
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance, requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. Over the last 2 years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We are also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago on 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of 110 basis point improvement operating margin, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher-margin rate. 
As we have frequently pointed out, IS&T book to bill has been at or in excess of 1:1 for each of the past 4 years, resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog into revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The culmination of this ER and a new administration slowed the pace of awards, particularly in our fed civ business. While both defense and fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We round up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but we're at the high end of our operating earnings expectation because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. 
So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out-year commentary on 2019 through 2021, initially by business group and then a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mixed shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, carry no margin. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 at the low point in earnings during the transition to our new model with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7%, very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion, a $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between -- to be at $735 million to $745 million with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. 
So for 2018 company-wide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax position and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into 4 and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and 3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. 
Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,549366125,1373133,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.",603,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9% for the quarter and 28.6% for the full year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate, as required under generally accepted accounting principles. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects: the lower statutory rate on domestic income; the elimination of historic benefits, such as the domestic production credit; and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S. operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history where the relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S. statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefits from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future options exercises. So we'll update our tax rate as they occur. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you'll recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $115 million. 
We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents, of $1 billion. That's down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion.  
On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares, bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017. And we've also made several acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plan in 2017, as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We'll examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments, and happily and officiously, we have a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive and in our core, and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we've talked about this for many years, the only long-term, steady, reliable, repeatable element of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and ,in the case of tax reform, provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event."

So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next 2 years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period. And think about the transition in 2 pieces, one that we've been living through for the last 2 years, where we're bringing down 450, 550 production, and to offset the -- any earnings decline as a result of that, we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing, somewhat, the 650 production, which we have done, in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning. All of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition, where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and, ultimately, very low rate production, we're feathering back from 650, as appropriate and as we told you we would, in the advent of the 600 comes onboard, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track. We're very much on track in exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we have been in. We never discussed our R&D. But again, suffice it to say that it has been robust, and it will continue to be robust going forward."

What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities, including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities, across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to, the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plans, the free cash flow conversion could end up approaching 100%. If not 100%, we continue to target that range, but, call it, still in the 90s. We well exceeded 100% in 2017, even beyond our original expectations, but we're back structurally in that range. And so I think that's how you think of it. But we'll probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that's more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D and so on, to support the growth of the business. And they can -- they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid-90s to the 100% range, depending on where those ultimately end up. All opportunities for growth in the business."

Typically, we can cover a relatively short-term CR rather wholesomely, and this year was a little bit different. And I can get into that if you wish. But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying lengths of the CR. So we'll be in, I believe, better shape, and we're comfortable that we're in better shape this year with an extended CR than we were last year. Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about it. The short-cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR. But typically, we can cover that. In '17, we has a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that -- or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn't get in '17 and moved into '18. But in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army start-ups, which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield reviews. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales."

I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses, because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical on a hot war. The tactical forces receive the preponderance of the funding, and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict, then the strategic forces, which, in our case, is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both. We need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we have in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years, over a decade, of the consumption of its material. But it needs to not only replace, but upgrade that material, and they put the money behind it. So I like -- I think we're well balanced.

We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings fro",2547,"Good morning. We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax provision. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this onetime event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year-ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in Exhibits A and B of our press release. I suspect you'll see a lot more of this as other aerospace and defense companies report, as you've already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all around. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $30.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7%, as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax reform act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year, leaving us well positioned for 2018. 
Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was a $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow was going to be approximately 100% of net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed a $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance. So I will review the year in the quarter, as adjusted, on a year-over-year basis for the group, without reference to the sequential comparison. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue and lower operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all 4 quarters. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1 point -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%, the result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1% to 19.2%. At year-end, we had higher margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible preowned aircraft sales. By the way, we worked really hard to avoid preowned sales because they carry no margin. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book to bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1.3:$1 denominated and 1.4:1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on this subject as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsized orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second-best quarter for the G650 and 650ER since -- in order terms, since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders, led by the 650 and the 650ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. 
During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively, at long-range cruise of 0.8 Mach. At 0.9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way, we announced increases only when we are certain they can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leads me to another subject. 
I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which has held up very well in a slow market. We have clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject, if they become available. 
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue, and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. 
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ-type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally, demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion contract for combat wheeled vehicles with Romania earlier this month. And the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S. market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle and munitions businesses, fueling our 0.9:1 book to bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with -- and continued its history of strong operating leverage. 
For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge at Bath Iron Works, which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASSCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on 120 basis point improvement in operating margin, so better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings at $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. 
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance, requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. Over the last 2 years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We are also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago on 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of 110 basis point improvement operating margin, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher-margin rate. 
As we have frequently pointed out, IS&T book to bill has been at or in excess of 1:1 for each of the past 4 years, resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog into revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The combination of this [ CR ] and a new administration slowed the pace of awards, particularly in our fed civ business. While both defense and fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We round up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but we're at the high end of our operating earnings expectation because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. 
So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out-year commentary on 2019 through 2021, initially by business group and then a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mixed shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, carry no margin. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 as the low point in earnings during the transition to our new models with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7%, very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion, a $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between -- to be at $735 million to $745 million with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. 
So for 2018 company-wide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax provision and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into 4 and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and 3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. 
Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,549366125,1373200,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.",603,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9% for the quarter and 28.6% for the full year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate, as required under generally accepted accounting principles. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects: the lower statutory rate on domestic income; the elimination of historic benefits, such as the domestic production credit; and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S. operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history where the relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S. statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefits from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future options exercises. So we'll update our tax rate as they occur. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you'll recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $115 million. 
We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents, of $1 billion. That's down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion.  
On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares, bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017. And we've also made several acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plan in 2017, as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We'll examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments, and happily and [ officiously, ] we have a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive and in our core, and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we've talked about this for many years, the only long-term, steady, reliable, repeatable element of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and, in the case of tax reform, provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event."

So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next 2 years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period. And think about the transition in 2 pieces, one that we've been living through for the last 2 years, where we're bringing down 450, 550 production, and to offset the -- any earnings decline as a result of that, we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing, somewhat, the 650 production, which we have done, in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning. All of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition, where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and, ultimately, very low rate production, we're feathering back from 650, as it's appropriate and as we told you we would, and the advent of the 600 comes onboard, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track. We're very much on track in exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we have been in. We never discuss our R&D. But again, suffice it to say that it has been robust, and it will continue to be robust going forward."

So I don't think tax reform necessarily has -- in fact I know tax reform didn't have an impact on our free cash conversion rate. What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities, including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities, across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to, the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plans, the free cash flow conversion could end up approaching 100%. If not 100%, we continue to target that range, but, call it, still in the 90s. We well exceeded 100% in 2017, even beyond our original expectations, but we're back structurally in that range. And so I think that's how you think of it. But we'll probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that's more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D and so on, to support the growth of the business. And they can -- they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid-90s to the 100% range, depending on where those ultimately end up. All opportunities for growth in the business."

But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying lengths of the CR. So we'll be in, I believe, better shape, and we're comfortable that we're in better shape this year with an extended CR than we were last year. Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about it. The short-cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR. But typically, we can cover that. In '17, we has a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that -- or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn't get in '17 and moved into '18. But in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army start-ups, which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield reviews. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales."

I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses, because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical. In a hot war, the tactical forces receive the preponderance of the funding, and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict, then the strategic forces, which, in our case, is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both. We need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we have in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years, over a decade, of the consumption of its material. But it needs to not only replace, but upgrade that material, and they put the money behind it. So I like -- I think we're well balanced.

We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings fro",2547,"Good morning. We are very pleased to have Howard join our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax provision. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this onetime event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year-ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in Exhibits A and B of our press release. I suspect you'll see a lot more of this as other aerospace and defense companies report, as you've already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all around. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $30.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7%, as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax reform act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year, leaving us well positioned for 2018. 
Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was a $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow was going to be approximately 100% of net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed a $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance. So I will review the year in the quarter, as adjusted, on a year-over-year basis for the group, without reference to the sequential comparison. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue and lower operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all 4 quarters. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1 point -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%, the result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1% to 19.2%. At year-end, we had higher margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible preowned aircraft sales. By the way, we worked really hard to avoid preowned sales because they carry no margin. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book to bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1.3:$1 denominated and 1.4:1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on this subject as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsized orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second-best quarter for the G650 and 650ER since -- in order terms, since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders, led by the 650 and the 650ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. 
During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively, at long-range cruise of 0.8 Mach. At 0.9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way, we announced increases only when we are certain they can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leads me to another subject. 
I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which has held up very well in a slow market. We have clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject, if they become available. 
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue, and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. 
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ-type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally, demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion contract for combat wheeled vehicles with Romania earlier this month. And the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S. market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle and munitions businesses, fueling our 0.9:1 book to bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with -- and continued its history of strong operating leverage. 
For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge at Bath Iron Works, which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASSCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on 120 basis point improvement in operating margin, so better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings at $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. 
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance, requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. Over the last 2 years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We are also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago on 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of 110 basis point improvement operating margin, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher-margin rate. 
As we have frequently pointed out, IS&T book to bill has been at or in excess of 1:1 for each of the past 4 years, resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog into revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The combination of this [ CR ] and a new administration slowed the pace of awards, particularly in our fed civ business. While both defense and fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We round up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but we're at the high end of our operating earnings expectation because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. 
So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out-year commentary on 2019 through 2021, initially by business group and then a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mixed shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, carry no margin. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 as the low point in earnings during the transition to our new models with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7%, very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion, a $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between -- to be at $735 million to $745 million with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. 
So for 2018 company-wide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax provision and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into 4 and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and 3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. 
Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,549366125,1373340,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.",603,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the subject that's getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that's the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9% for the quarter and 28.6% for the full year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate, as required under generally accepted accounting principles. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects: the lower statutory rate on domestic income; the elimination of historic benefits, such as the domestic production credit; and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S. operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history where the relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S. statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefits from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future options exercises. So we'll update our tax rate as they occur. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you'll recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $115 million. 
We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents, of $1 billion. That's down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion.  
On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares, bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017. And we've also made several acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plan in 2017, as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We'll examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments, and happily and [ officiously, ] we have a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive and in our core, and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we've talked about this for many years, the only long-term, steady, reliable, repeatable element of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and, in the case of tax reform, provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event."

So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next 2 years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period. And think about the transition in 2 pieces, one that we've been living through for the last 2 years, where we're bringing down 450, 550 production, and to offset the -- any earnings decline as a result of that, we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing, somewhat, the 650 production, which we have done, in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning. All of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition, where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and, ultimately, very low rate production, we're feathering back from 650, as it's appropriate and as we told you we would, and the advent of the 600 comes onboard, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track. We're very much on track in exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we have been in. We never discuss our R&D. But again, suffice it to say that it has been robust, and it will continue to be robust going forward."

So I don't think tax reform necessarily has -- in fact I know tax reform didn't have an impact on our free cash conversion rate. What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities, including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities, across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to, the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plans, the free cash flow conversion could end up approaching 100%. If not 100%, we continue to target that range, but, call it, still in the 90s. We well exceeded 100% in 2017, even beyond our original expectations, but we're back structurally in that range. And so I think that's how you think of it. But we'll probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that's more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D and so on, to support the growth of the business. And they can -- they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid-90s to the 100% range, depending on where those ultimately end up. All opportunities for growth in the business."

But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying lengths of the CR.

Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about it. The short-cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR. But typically, we can cover that. In '17, we has a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that -- or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn't get in '17 and moved into '18. But in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army start-ups, which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield reviews. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales."

I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses, because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical. In a hot war, the tactical forces receive the preponderance of the funding, and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict, then the strategic forces, which, in our case, is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both. We need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we have in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years, over a decade, of the consumption of its material. But it needs to not only replace, but upgrade that material, and they put the money behind it. So I like -- I think we're well balanced. I don't want any particular surprises in any of the studies that have come out recently, and we had factored all of that into our thinking."

I intend to keep my remarks on performance on the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing",1600,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. I intend to keep my remarks on performance on the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments in IS&T and Aerospace in particular. 
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.55 on revenue somewhat as $7.5 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $799 million. 
All of the numbers that I'm about to give you, with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes, are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. 
So compared to the first quarter 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 13.4% was very good, but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. 
On the other hand, net earnings of $799 million were up $36 million or 4.7% on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower than expected tax rate. 
Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our 3 segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The Defense segments earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrated what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. 
This leads quite naturally to the discussion of Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220-basis-point contraction a margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much was anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue, but higher on earnings and consensus. 
In fact, we have planned to deliver 2 more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter, but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April, the G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If they had managed those delivery the spent, we would've been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. 
It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during the Easter week. The same could be true -- the same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace was right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on 2 deliveries. It was also well to remember that over plan for revenue is backend loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. 
Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8:1. This was consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. There Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter of the last 5 years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a strong -- it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. 
I should also note that the activity has been good in April with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian business aviation airshow were at the top of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of immediate discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. 
With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIF we announced 4 years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous in the certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component level tests, which expanded the program as we develop configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. 
This work, coupled with the G500 and G600 reengine enhancement testing has added to our total program time, but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed test for flights in the known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing known us function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final docket -- document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. 
We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 plan customer deliveries. 
This new technology aircraft was active control side sticks, touchscreen displays and fly by wire and continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts and we'll wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. 
Our service business at Gulfstream remain strong with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. 
We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have standalone Gulfstream support facilities. 
Now let me turn to the defense side of the business, starting with combat systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There were strong performance across the board in each one of the 3 businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70-basis-point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always had very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. 
With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which include significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams Main Battle Tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions product, both domestically and internationally. 
Internationally, our European-based businesses continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of a 1:1, funded backlog at $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. 
Turning to IS&T, this is going to be the last quarter we report to in this particular format. I will do so here, give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. 
IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1:1. These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. 
Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings and operating margins in the quarter for each of the 2 businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. 
Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million and our operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. 
At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year."
274561,559167328,1435895,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT separately. To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you",270,"As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT separately. To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. 
For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. 
From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single digit range, around 8%. 
So with that as the base line, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have 3 quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom-line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which will have a better sense of this quarter and report the you on our second quarter call. 
But at a macro level, we expect that after the onetime charge associated with the cost to compete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings-per-share starting the third quarter."

Finally, Marine systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards.

Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards. Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. 
Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all the 3 shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by 9% operating margin, a 70-basis-point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%, but earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. 
Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia, forecast a begin full construction in 2020. is working down its learning curve on the restart DG51s and delivered the second DDG 1000 yesterday. The last of the 3 DDG 1000 delivers in 2020. 
NASCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Nay and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as constructive building block to a good year. We do not, as a practice, change guidance of the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a helpful review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension and cash."
274561,559167328,1435895,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple of points on the income statement starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly hi",573,"Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple of points on the income statement starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on the debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. 
We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the nonservice cost portion of our pension expense and other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension, income and expense on the income statement. No impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. 
One more point on the subject of pensions. We noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light led of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing this analysis, we are now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contribution this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on a just a minute. 
But before I go there, one more point on the income statement. Our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full-year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated I that guidance based on the of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018  to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. 
On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and 2 suppliers and doesn't affect our full-year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged, but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier, and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you more granular sense off when we update our full-year guidance in July. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So when we talked about the first full year guidance and they talked about the next year's guidance, that went the 9 months of this year that will have them plus the first quarter of next year.

So I think the bottom line is with respect to the cash in the quarter, as you pointed out, it is a variety of the working capital accounts, but it really is nothing more than timing. It's payments from customers and payments to suppliers. But frankly, it was largely profiled for the quarter. We anticipated a softer first quarter this year within the forecast we originally gave you. Part of that is the continued build at Gulfstream. Again, nothing outside or outside of our original plan. So all of that is par for the course in everything we expected in the first 3 months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation and a business unit that had cost the catch up, and that's already been caught up in the month of April so we're back on track there. I feel very good about the cash forecast we gave you. As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric, that 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive the talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion and then how we're going to deploy that operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now close about 3 weeks, so we're still closing the books from the fiscal 2018 and working out the final details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our evaluation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence.

Our customers expect Gulfstream service and the excellence implied with Gulfstream service, and we're delivering it. So we continue -- we anticipate continued growth in that market as our feet increases. And frankly, while on any given quarter, the service margin, let's just talk about Gulfstream for a second, may be slightly dilutive to new airplane margins. They are very wholesome and the margins of service are really depending on a number of things. The loading at the service centers and the mix. So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States where Gulfstream does not have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added 6 FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberately. By the way, these aircraft services business is a relatively low risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow. So all good from that perspective."

I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive.

I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments, and IS&T and Aerospace in particular. 
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.65 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $799 million. 
All of the numbers that I'm about to give you, with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes, are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. 
So compared to the first quarter 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 13.4%, was very good, but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. 
On the other hand, net earnings of $799 million were up $36 million or 4.7% on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our 3 defense segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The defense segments' earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrating what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. 
This leads quite naturally to a discussion of the Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion, and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220 basis point contraction in margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much is anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue, but higher on earnings and consensus. 
In fact, we had planned to deliver 2 more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April. The G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If we had managed those deliveries as planned, we would have been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. 
It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during the Easter week. The same could be true -- the same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace is right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on 2 deliveries. It is also well to remember that our plan for revenue is back-end loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. 
Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8:1. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. There Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter of the last 5 years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a strong -- it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. 
I should also note that the activity has been good in April, with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian Business Aviation Airshow were that the talk of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of immediate discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe that the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. 
With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIF we announced 4 years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous FAA and EASA certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component level test, which expanded the program as we developed configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. 
This work, coupled with the G500 and G600 range enhancement testing, has added to our total program time but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed tests for flights into known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing known as function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final docket -- document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. 
We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 planned customer deliveries. 
This new technology aircraft with active control side sticks, touchscreen displays and fly-by-wire and continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts, and we'll wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. 
Our service business at Gulfstream remains strong, with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. 
We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for Jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have stand-alone Gulfstream support facilities. 
Now let me turn to the defense side of the business, starting with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There was strong performance across the board in each 1 of the 3 businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always had a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. 
With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which includes significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams main battle tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions products, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, our European-based business continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. 
Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of a 1:1. Funded backlog at $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. 
Turning to IS&T. This is going to be the last quarter we report to in this particular format. I will do so here give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group, and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. 
IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1:1. 
These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. 
Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings and operating margins in the quarter for each of the 2 businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. 
Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. 
GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million and an operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. 
At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year."
274561,559167328,1436037,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately. To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave y",273,"As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately. 
To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues, between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single-digit range, around 8%. 
So with that as a base line, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have 3 quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which we'll have a better sense of this quarter and report to you on our second quarter call. 
But at a macro level, we expect that after the onetime charge associated with the cost to complete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings per share starting in the third quarter."

Finally, let's turn to Marine systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards. Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase",357,"Thanks, Jason. Finally, let's turn to Marine systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards. 
Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all the 3 shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by a 9% operating margin, a 70 basis point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%. But earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. 
Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia forecast to begin full construction in 2020. Bath is working down its learning curve on the restart DDG 51s and delivered the second DDG 1000 yesterday. The last of the 3 DDG 1000s delivers in 2020. 
NASSCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Navy and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as a constructive building block to a good year. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension and cash."
274561,559167328,1436037,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly high",575,"Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on a debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed-rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. 
We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the nonservice cost portion of our pension expense in other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter, and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension, income and expense on the income statement. No impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. 
One more point on the subject of pensions. We noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing that analysis, we're now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contributions this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on in just a minute. 
But before I go there, one more point on the income statement. Our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated in that guidance based on the timing of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash flow to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. 
On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and 2 suppliers and doesn't affect our full year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged, but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you a more granular sense of when we update our full year guidance in July. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So if you look at the pattern of their revenue, it was at its peak in their fourth quarter. So when we talked about the first full year guidance and they talked about their next year's guidance, that went the 9 months of this year that we'll have them plus the first quarter of next year.

It's payments from customers and payments to suppliers. But frankly, it was largely profiled for the quarter. We anticipated a softer first quarter this year within the forecast we originally gave you. Part of that is the continued build at Gulfstream. But again, nothing outsized or outside of our original plan. So all of that is par for the course and everything we expected in the first 3 months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation in a business unit that caused the catch-up, and that's already been caught up in the month of April so we're back on track there. So I feel very good about the cash forecast we gave you. As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric. That 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive to talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion, and then how we're going to deploy that operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now closed for about 3 weeks, so we're still closing the books on their fiscal 2018 and working out the finer details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our valuation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence. So I feel bullish about the contribution they'll make for us this year."

So we continue -- we anticipate continued growth in that market as our feet increases. And frankly, while on any given quarter the service margin, let's just talk about Gulfstream for a second, may be slightly dilutive to new airplane margins, they're very wholesome. And the margins of service are really depending on -- depend on a number of things. The loading at the service centers and the mix. So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again, to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States, where Gulfstream doesn't have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added 6 FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberatively. By the way, this aircraft services business is a relatively low-risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service business because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow. So all good from that perspective."

I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing",1608,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments, and IS&T and Aerospace in particular. 
  
  For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.65 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $799 million. 
  
  All of the numbers that I'm about to give you, with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes, are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. 
  
  So compared to the first quarter 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 13.4%, was very good, but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. 
  
  On the other hand, net earnings of $799 million were up $36 million or 4.7% on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
  
  Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our 3 defense segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The defense segments' earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrating what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. 
  
  This leads quite naturally to a discussion of the Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion, and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220 basis point contraction in margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much is anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue, but higher on earnings and consensus. 
  
  In fact, we had planned to deliver 2 more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April. The G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If we had managed those deliveries as planned, we would have been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. 
  
  It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during the Easter week. The same could be true -- the same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace is right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on 2 deliveries. It is also well to remember that our plan for revenue is back-end loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. 
  
  Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8:1. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. There Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter of the last 5 years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a strong -- it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. 
  
  I should also note that the activity has been good in April, with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian Business Aviation Airshow were that the talk of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of a media discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe that the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. 
  
  With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIF we announced 4 years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous FAA and EASA certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component level test, which expanded the program as we developed configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. 
  
  This work, coupled with the G500 and G600 range enhancement testing, has added to our total program time but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed tests for flights into known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing known as function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final docket -- document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. 
  
  We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 planned customer deliveries. 
  
  This new technology aircraft with active control side sticks, touchscreen displays and fly-by-wire and continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts, and we'll wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. 
  
  Our service business at Gulfstream remains strong, with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. 
  
  We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for Jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have stand-alone Gulfstream support facilities. 
  
  Now let me turn to the defense side of the business, starting with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There was strong performance across the board in each 1 of the 3 businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always had a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. 
  
  With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which includes significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams main battle tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions products, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, our European-based business continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. 
  
  Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of a 1:1. Funded backlog at $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. 
  
  Turning to IS&T. This is going to be the last quarter we report to in this particular format. I will do so here give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group, and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. 
  
  IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1:1. 
  
  These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. 
  
  Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings and operating margins in the quarter for each of the 2 businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. 
  
  Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. 
  
  GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million and an operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. 
  
  At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year."
274561,559167328,1436320,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately.

  To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues, between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single-digit range, around 8%. 
  
  So with that as a base line, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have 3 quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which we'll have a better sense of this quarter and report to you on our second quarter call. 
  
  But at a macro level, we expect that after the onetime charge associated with the cost to complete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings per share starting in the third quarter."

Finally, let's turn to Marine systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards.

Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards. 
  
  Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all the 3 shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by a 9% operating margin, a 70 basis point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%. But earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
  
  The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. 
  
  Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia forecast to begin full construction in 2020. Bath is working down its learning curve on the restart DDG 51s and delivered the second DDG 1000 yesterday. The last of the 3 DDG 1000s delivers in 2020. 
  
  NASSCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Navy and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as a constructive building block to a good year. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
  
  I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension and cash."
274561,559167328,1436320,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly high",575,"Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on a debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed-rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. 
  
  We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the nonservice cost portion of our pension expense in other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter, and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension, income and expense on the income statement. No impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. 
  
  One more point on the subject of pensions. We noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing that analysis, we're now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contributions this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on in just a minute. 
  
  But before I go there, one more point on the income statement. Our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated in that guidance based on the timing of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. 
  
  On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash flow to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. 
  
  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. 
  
  On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and 2 suppliers and doesn't affect our full year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged, but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you a more granular sense of when we update our full year guidance in July. 
  
  Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So if you look at the pattern of their revenue, it was at its peak in their fourth quarter. So when we talked about the first full year guidance and they talked about their next year's guidance, that went the 9 months of this year that we'll have them plus the first quarter of next year.

We anticipated a softer first quarter this year within the forecast we originally gave you. Part of that is the continued build at Gulfstream. But again, nothing outsized or outside of our original plan. So all of that is par for the course and everything we expected in the first 3 months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation in a business unit that caused the catch-up, and that's already been caught up in the month of April so we're back on track there. So I feel very good about the cash forecast we gave you. As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric. That 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive to talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion, and then how we're going to deploy that operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now closed for about 3 weeks, so we're still closing the books on their fiscal 2018 and working out the finer details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our valuation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence. So I feel bullish about the contribution they'll make for us this year."

And frankly, while on any given quarter the service margin, let's just talk about Gulfstream for a second, may be slightly dilutive to new airplane margins, they're very wholesome. And the margins of service are really depending on -- depend on a number of things. The loading at the service centers and the mix. So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again, to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States, where Gulfstream doesn't have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added 6 FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberatively. By the way, this aircraft services business is a relatively low-risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service business because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow. So all good from that perspective."

I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive.

I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments, and IS&T and Aerospace in particular. 
  
  For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.65 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $799 million. 
  
  All of the numbers that I'm about to give you, with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes, are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. 
  
  So compared to the first quarter 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 13.4%, was very good, but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. 
  
  On the other hand, net earnings of $799 million were up $36 million or 4.7% on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
  
  Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our 3 defense segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The defense segments' earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrating what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. 
  
  This leads quite naturally to a discussion of the Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion, and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220 basis point contraction in margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much is anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue, but higher on earnings and consensus. 
  
  In fact, we had planned to deliver 2 more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April. The G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If we had managed those deliveries as planned, we would have been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. 
  
  It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during the Easter week. The same could be true -- the same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace is right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on 2 deliveries. It is also well to remember that our plan for revenue is back-end loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. 
  
  Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8:1. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. There Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter of the last 5 years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a strong -- it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. 
  
  I should also note that the activity has been good in April, with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian Business Aviation Airshow were that the talk of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of a media discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe that the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. 
  
  With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIF we announced 4 years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous FAA and EASA certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component level test, which expanded the program as we developed configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. 
  
  This work, coupled with the G500 and G600 range enhancement testing, has added to our total program time but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed tests for flights into known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing known as function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final docket -- document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. 
  
  We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 planned customer deliveries. 
  
  This new technology aircraft with active control side sticks, touchscreen displays and fly-by-wire and continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts, and we'll wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. 
  
  Our service business at Gulfstream remains strong, with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. 
  
  We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for Jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have stand-alone Gulfstream support facilities. 
  
  Now let me turn to the defense side of the business, starting with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There was strong performance across the board in each 1 of the 3 businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always had a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. 
  
  With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which includes significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams main battle tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions products, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, our European-based business continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. 
  
  Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of a 1:1. Funded backlog at $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. 
  
  Turning to IS&T. This is going to be the last quarter we report to in this particular format. I will do so here give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group, and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. 
  
  IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1:1. 
  
  These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. 
  
  Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings and operating margins in the quarter for each of the 2 businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. 
  
  Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. 
  
  GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million and an operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. 
  
  At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year."
274561,559167328,1437300,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the 2 IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately.

  To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues, between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single-digit range, around 8%. 
  
  So with that as a baseline, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have 3 quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which we'll have a better sense of this quarter and report to you on our second quarter call. 
  
  But at a macro level, we expect that after the onetime charge associated with the cost to complete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings per share starting in the third quarter."
274561,559167328,1437300,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jason. Finally, let's turn to Marine systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards.

Importantly, revenue was up in each of the 3 shipyards. 
  
  Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all the 3 shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by a 9% operating margin, a 70 basis point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%. But earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
  
  The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. 
  
  Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia forecast to begin full construction in 2020. Bath is working down its learning curve on the restart DDG 51s and delivered the second DDG 1000 yesterday. The last of the 3 DDG 1000s delivers in 2020. 
  
  NASSCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Navy and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as a constructive building block to a good year. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
  
  I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension and cash."
274561,559167328,1437300,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly high",575,"Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on a debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed-rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. 
  
  We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the nonservice cost portion of our pension expense in other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter, and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension, income and expense on the income statement. No impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. 
  
  One more point on the subject of pensions. We noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing that analysis, we're now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contributions this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on in just a minute. 
  
  But before I go there, one more point on the income statement. Our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated in that guidance based on the timing of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. 
  
  On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash flow to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. 
  
  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. 
  
  On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and 2 suppliers and doesn't affect our full year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged, but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you a more granular sense of when we update our full year guidance in July. 
  
  Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So if you look at the pattern of their revenue, it was at its peak in their fourth quarter. So when we talked about the first full year guidance and they talked about their next year's guidance, that went the 9 months of this year that we'll have them plus the first quarter of next year.

But again, nothing outsized or outside of our original plan. So all of that is par for the course and everything we expected in the first 3 months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation in a business unit that caused the catch-up, and that's already been caught up in the month of April so we're back on track there.

As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric. That 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive to talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion, and then how we're going to deploy that operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now closed for about 3 weeks, so we're still closing the books on their fiscal 2018 and working out the finer details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our valuation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence. So I feel bullish about the contribution they'll make for us this year."

So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again, to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States, where Gulfstream doesn't have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added 6 FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberatively. By the way, this aircraft services business is a relatively low-risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service business because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow. So all good from that perspective."

As you can discern from our more more press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million.

As you can discern from our more more press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up [ $37 ] million or 4.9%, on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the [ $70 million ] of one-time costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA but a little more on that from Jason in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9%, and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9% on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million one-time costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down [ $17 million ] burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of costs in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. Earnings and continuing operations were up $73 million [ or ] 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressive the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter, absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These one-time period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half, mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half, and I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition, cash, backlog and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million or $183 million and $35 million lower, respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million and operating earnings were up $40 million on 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong [ 1.3 to 1 ] This brings the book-to-bill to [ 1 to 1 ] for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. 1 year ago, at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace-funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650 ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be [ 1:1 ] or better in the second half, better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. As you know, the G500 was [indiscernible] on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers and locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation Gulfstream strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of CSRA. Turning to the individual segments. Combat systems had a very good quarter, as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter of 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for 2 years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5% and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordinance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a [ $260 ] million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract was part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their 9 Stryker brigades. We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3.0 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK Ajax program is transitioning to production from engineering, with peak progression in 2021. We are obviously, trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story. With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year-ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to combat systems, the 2017 experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, 2 years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million and operating earnings were up $11 million, [ a ] 6.6% and 6%, respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virgina class Block 4 boats and have begun to purchase long lead material for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. With respect to bast, the challenges on the first DDG 1000 boat and the DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us, with nice performance from the DDG 1001 and 1002 and on the follow-on DDG 51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG 51 Flight 3 upgrade. Finally, service repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp-up in the second half. In all, Marine systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. We are now reporting what was IS&T in [ 2 ] segments: First, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and federal civilian agencies. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million was steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin, due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half. Mission Systems reports internally in 3 lines of business: ISR systems, communications and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular, space payloads and encryption and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first-half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of [ 1:1 ] in '16, '17 and the first half of '18. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of Legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1%, excluding CSRA against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $156 million, with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year-ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.58 billion was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3%, excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up [ $80 ] million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4%, consistent with the second quarter results. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost-effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies. Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know-how. So in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and grew earnings and backlog. I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."
274561,573779869,1507160,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, for the one-time transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A porti",874,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, for the one-time transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs largely related to change of control provisions are reported in our operating earnings as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, while the balance, legal accounting and other advisory fees, is reported in Other Income and Expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these one-time fees in other expenses in the first quarter, and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share. Including these one-time charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below-the-line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year. Turning to net interest expense. We reported $103 million in the quarter compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial preacquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which are approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the 9 months of 2018. Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions. So the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net of full year rate of 19%. Turning to capital deployment. We paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year to $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter, and after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year, we expect free our cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter. Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company, along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in the quarter, bringing them to 1.1x for the first half of the year. The one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a diminomous impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rate from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our combat systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding this impact, these 2 groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of [ 0.9x and 1:1 ] respectively. In fact, our Defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9x in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems, where as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of a multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contracts later this year. Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up, including our updated guidance for the year."

For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 m",518,"So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare to what we told you in January, and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million from 2017. Operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, when G500 deliveries begin in earnest. For combat systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from '17, with operating earnings around [ $970 ] million on an operating margin of around [ 15.7% ] We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%. So approximately, [$150  ] million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins are at $8.7 billion and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion, with margins slightly better than the previous forecast, resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from '17, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion but the margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the 2 legacy businesses is between $9.4 billion and $9.5 million. Rather than taking it any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion, with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue, with operating margins [ crowding ] 6%. For IT, roles [ of ] revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion, with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. So all of this sums to revenue for GD about [ $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion ] and operating margin somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook over comps what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees in expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement. With that, I'll turn it back to Howard on those extra questions."

So that's the prism through which we should look at the Marine Group. That said, as we ramp up on Columbia, we will see some margin compression quite naturally because that will be cost-plus work. So -- and given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while, offset of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance, which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the outrage -- out-year  estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will in 7 or 8 years completely dwarf Virginian, that's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. Think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in [ '20 ] and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next 4, 5 years. So we'll be able as we -- I think I mentioned from time ago, we signed last year, a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that.

That's -- under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated message.

As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9%, on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset, in part, by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of onetime costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA. But a little more on that from Jason, in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9%, and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9%, on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million onetime costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of costs in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. 
Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. 
In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter, absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half, mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. 
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half, and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition, cash, backlog and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million, or $183 million and $35 million lower, respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million, and operating earnings were up $40 million, on 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3:1.This brings the book-to-bill to 1:1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. 1 year ago, at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace-funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. 
In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1:1 or better in the second half, better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. 
As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter, with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers and locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation/Gulfstream  strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. 
Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of CSRA. 
Turning to the individual segments. Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for 2 years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5%, and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordinance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their 9 Stryker brigades.
We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth.
Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering, with peak production in 2021. We are obviously, trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year-ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, 2 years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million, and operating earnings were up $11 million, or 6.6% and 6%, respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. 
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia-class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virgina class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. 
With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG 1000 boat and the DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us, with nice performance from the DDG 1001 and 1002 and on the follow-on DDG 51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG 51 Flight III upgrade.
Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
We are now reporting what was IS&T in 2 segments: first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and federal civilian agencies.
Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half.
Mission Systems reports internally in 3 lines of business: ISR systems, communications and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular, space payloads and encryption and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million, and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first-half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1:1 in '16, '17 and the first half of '18. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1%, excluding CSRA against the year-ago quarter.
Operating earnings were $156 million, with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year-ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $3.58 billion was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3%, excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4%, consistent with the second quarter results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost-effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies.
Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know-how. 
So in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and grew earnings and backlog.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."
274561,573779869,1507632,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, were the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A porti",872,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, were the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs largely related to change of control provisions are reported in our operating earnings as required by generally accepted accounting principles, while the balance, legal accounting and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these onetime fees in other expenses in the first quarter, and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share.
Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below-the-line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year.
Turning to net interest expense. We reported $103 million in the quarter compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which were approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the 9 months of 2018. 
Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions. So the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net of full year rate of 19%.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter, and after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter.
Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company, along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in the quarter, bringing them to 1.1x for the first half of the year.
And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding this impact, these 2 groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9x and 1:1, respectively. In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9x in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems, where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of the multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contracts later this year. 
Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up, including our updated guidance for the year."
274561,573779869,1507632,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $2",509,"So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, when G500 deliveries begin in earnest.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from '17, with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%. So approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. 
For the marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins were at 8.7% and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion, with margins slightly better than the previous forecast, resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from '17, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with the margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the 2 legacy businesses is between $9.4 billion and $9.5 million. Rather than taking it any way -- any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion, with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue, with operating margins crowding 6%. So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion, with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. 
So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement.
With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions."

So that's the prism through which we should look at marine group. That said, as we ramp up on Columbia, we will see some margin compression quite naturally because that will be cost plus work. So -- and given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while, offset of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance, which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the outrage -- out-year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will -- 7 or 8 years, completely dwarfed or heavily dwarfed, Virginia. That's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. And think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in '20, and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next  4, 5 years. So we'll be able as we -- I think I mentioned from time ago, we signed, last year, a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that.

As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-a",1987,"Good morning. As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9%, on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset, in part, by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of onetime costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA. But a little more on that from Jason, in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9%, and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9%, on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million onetime costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of costs in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. 
Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. 
In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter, absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half, mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. 
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half, and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition, cash, backlog and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million, or $183 million and $35 million lower, respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million, and operating earnings were up $40 million, on 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3:1.This brings the book-to-bill to 1:1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. One year ago, at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace-funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. 
In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1:1 or better in the second half, better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. 
As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter, with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers in locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation/Gulfstream  strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. 
Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of CSRA. 
Turning to the individual segments. Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for 2 years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5%, and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordinance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their 9 Stryker brigades.
We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth.
Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering, with peak production in 2021. We are obviously, trending in the right direction at Combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year-ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, 2 years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million, and operating earnings were up $11 million, or 6.6% and 6%, respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. 
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia-class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virgina class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. 
With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG 1000 boat and the DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us, with nice performance from the DDG 1001 and 1002 and on the follow-on DDG 51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG 51 Flight III upgrade.
Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
We are now reporting what was IS&T in 2 segments: first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and federal civilian agencies.
Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half.
Mission Systems reports internally in 3 lines of business: ISR systems, communications and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular, space payloads and encryption and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million, and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first-half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1:1 in '16, '17 and the first half of '18. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1%, excluding CSRA against the year-ago quarter.
Operating earnings were $156 million, with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year-ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $3.58 billion was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3%, excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4%, consistent with the second quarter results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost-effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies.
Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know-how. 
So in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and grew earnings and backlog.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."
274561,573779869,1507894,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portio",872,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs largely related to change of control provisions are reported in our operating earnings as required by generally accepted accounting principles, while the balance, legal accounting and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these onetime fees in other expenses in the first quarter, and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share.
Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below-the-line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year.
Turning to net interest expense. We reported $103 million in the quarter compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which were approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the 9 months of 2018. 
Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions. So the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net of full year rate of 19%.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter, and after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter.
Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company, along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in the quarter, bringing them to 1.1x for the first half of the year.
And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding this impact, these 2 groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9x and 1:1, respectively. In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9x in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems, where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of the multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contracts later this year. 
Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up, including our updated guidance for the year."
274561,573779869,1507894,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $2",509,"So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, when G500 deliveries begin in earnest.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from '17, with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%. So approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. 
For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins were at 8.7% and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion, with margins slightly better than the previous forecast, resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from '17, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with the margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the 2 legacy businesses is between $9.4 billion and $9.5 billion. Rather than taking it any way -- any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion, with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue, with operating margins crowding 6%. So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion, with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. 
So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement.
With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions."

So -- and given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while, offset of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance, which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the outrage -- out-year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will -- 7 or 8 years, completely dwarf or heavily dwarf Virginia. That's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. And think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in '20, and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next 4 or 5 years. So we'll be able as we -- I think I mentioned some time ago, we signed, last year, a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that.

Again, ex that amortization. And a point on that, you -- I noted in the remarks that we had 100 -- we're anticipating $190 million of amortization this year for the CSRA transaction. That's -- under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated method. So we'll have $190 million for the 9 months of this year followed by, I think, it's $200 million next year, and then it'll ratchet down over time. So you'll see that in a little more detail in the 10-Q we'll publish later today. But that will, I think, help you, sort of, model impacts on margin rates. If you think of core CSRA contribution ex amortization in the double-digit range consistent with their history. So that's sort of the story on the GDIT side."

As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-a",1987,"Good morning. As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter, with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9%, on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset, in part, by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of onetime costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA. But a little more on that from Jason, in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9%, and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9%, on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million onetime costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of costs in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. 
Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. 
In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter, absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half, mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. 
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half, and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition, cash, backlog and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million, or $183 million and $35 million lower, respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million, and operating earnings were up $40 million, on 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3:1.This brings the book-to-bill to 1:1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. One year ago, at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace-funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. 
In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1:1 or better in the second half, better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. 
As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter, with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers in locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation/Gulfstream  strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. 
Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of CSRA. 
Turning to the individual segments. Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for 2 years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5%, and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordinance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their 9 Stryker brigades.
We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth.
Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering, with peak production in 2021. We are obviously, trending in the right direction at Combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year-ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, 2 years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million, and operating earnings were up $11 million, or 6.6% and 6%, respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. 
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia-class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virgina class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. 
With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG 1000 boat and the DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us, with nice performance from the DDG 1001 and 1002 and on the follow-on DDG 51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG 51 Flight III upgrade.
Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
We are now reporting what was IS&T in 2 segments: first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and federal civilian agencies.
Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half.
Mission Systems reports internally in 3 lines of business: ISR systems, communications and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular, space payloads and encryption and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million, and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first-half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1:1 in '16, '17 and the first half of '18. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1%, excluding CSRA against the year-ago quarter.
Operating earnings were $156 million, with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year-ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $3.58 billion was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3%, excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4%, consistent with the second quarter results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost-effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies.
Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know-how. 
So in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and grew earnings and backlog.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."
274561,573779869,1508403,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portio",872,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement, and in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs largely related to change of control provisions are reported in our operating earnings as required by generally accepted accounting principles, while the balance, legal accounting and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these onetime fees in other expenses in the first quarter, and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share.
Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below-the-line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year.
Turning to net interest expense. We reported $103 million in the quarter compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which were approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the 9 months of 2018. 
Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions. So the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net of full year rate of 19%.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter, and after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter.
Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company, along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in the quarter, bringing them to 1.1x for the first half of the year.
And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding this impact, these 2 groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9x and 1:1, respectively. In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9x in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems, where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of the multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contracts later this year. 
Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up, including our updated guidance for the year."
274561,573779869,1508403,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $2",509,"So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it in to our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, when G500 deliveries begin in earnest.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from '17, with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%. So approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. 
For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins were at 8.7% and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion, with margins slightly better than the previous forecast, resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from '17, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with the margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the 2 legacy businesses is between $9.4 billion and $9.5 billion. Rather than taking it any way -- any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion, with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue, with operating margins crowding 6%. So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion, with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. 
So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement.
With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions."

So -- and given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while, offset of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance, which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the outrage -- out-year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will -- 7 or 8 years, completely dwarf or heavily dwarf Virginia. That's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. And think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in '20, and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next 4 or 5 years. So we'll be able as we -- I think I mentioned some time ago, we signed, last year, a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that.

With respect to employees, we have retained every single employee that we have wanted to retain. And the beauty of this integration is that we're taking the management team of CSRA and the management team of GDIT, and we have melded it into a very, very effective, cohesive management team with a vision on how they want to proceed. They are melding the 2 cultures. They are bringing the best-in-class technical capabilities and the customer in each business and the customer intimacy in each business. So we're very pleased with our employee retention. We've had superb contract regeneration. There've been frankly, no surprises or disappointments in any of the contract activity since the acquisition. You know, it's an interesting -- just to give you a little bit of perspective on this. GDIT grew 9%, and for the quarter, CSRA grew 12.6% and that's particularly impressive, given their 9% growth in the quarter prior to the acquisition. These businesses are doing extremely well."

That's -- under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated method. So we'll have $190 million for the 9 months of this year followed by, I think, it's $200 million next year, and then it'll ratchet down over time. So you'll see that in a little more detail in the 10-Q we'll publish later today. But that will, I think, help you, sort of, model impacts on margin rates.

As it is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and i",2043,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As it is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and income from continuing operations of $864 million. The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially, in-line. Most of the beat occurred on the text line. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20% attributable in March prior to the CSRA acquisition. However, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All 5 reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter. Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction. In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings, absent the amortization expense, related to the transaction were $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million or 1% and operating earnings were up $47 million. The 2 quarters were very much alike. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million [ or ] 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of [ $719 ] million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine Group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures of Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the 9 months, as the business units continued to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers requirements. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year and $5.6 billion increase over the year-ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine Group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2x and a sharp increase in estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contract. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4x. Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat [ of ] $5 million or 1.3% to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins as expected. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million or 6.4% and operating earnings were of $133 million or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin. The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a [ 0.9 to 1 ] book-to-bill measure in dollar values of orders. Gulfstream alone was [ 0.9 to 1 ] on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contract comps surrounding Nordam's financial issues and its ability to deliver in itself to prior schedule. This caused numerous G500 and 600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That I am pleased to say is behind us and should help [ fourth ] quarter intake. Gulfstream has taken over the production of NASSCO and is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of [indiscernible] are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter. I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12-month basis, the book-to-bill was slightly in excess of [ 1:21 ] Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600, and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins. The G500 with 5200 nautical miles of range at [ 0.85 ] can travel 4400 nautical miles at [ 0.9 ] Just put that in some context. 4400 nautical miles was the approximate range of its predecessor, the G450, at [ 0.8 Mach], cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The 600 with [ 5500 ] nautical miles of range or [ 0.85 Mach ], has now also demonstrated 5500 nautical miles of range at [ 0.9 Mach ]actually quite stunning. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a solid quarter, with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million or 1.5% but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike with no material difference in volume or profit. Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings were up $24 million or 3.5%, despite a 50 basis point decline in operating margin. I should point out, the Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year ago quarter increases in revenue for 8 consecutive quarters. All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173  Stryker to the Avon configuration: the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all 9 brigades. We're also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements. For Marine, the good reported revenue of $2 billion [ or ] $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there is a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix. Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia Class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With 4 recent awards for repair work, we should expect to step up in volume for that category. Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multi-year contract from the Nacy for 4 DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords back the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY '19 through 2025. We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in 2 segments: Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agency and federal civilian agency. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue of $1.23 billion was $144 million or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date, revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or 6% increase. I have already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order taken in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated and organic future growth. Moving to Information Technology. The business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1%, excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year. Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. But excluding the acquisition-related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%. CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition costs. This is really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is down and continues to deliver early results. Finally, we've announced the divestiture of our call centers to Maximus as part of our portfolio shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions in high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shift is away from the more public facing markets. These assets are well placed with Maximus for [ holding this core ]. And by the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results. So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year is concerned? We fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions costs and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance so the range is now. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this Fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year. The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piece next year at this juncture. You will hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years. So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are going 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%.. That's particularly impressive during the year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army's recapitalizing and the Marine group is steady as she goes and Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aitken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to",572,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million. Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we are lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies the first quarter tax rate of approximately 21%. One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict-of-interest issue. Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pretax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations. Turning to capital deployment. We paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional pension contribution. Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comment about our order activity in the quarter. The total company book-to-bill was 1.4x in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion. And when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive, given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment in particular, given its significant international footprint. Specifically, over the first 9 months of the year, FX rate changes, driven by the strong dollar, reduced the segments backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect, with no economic value implication but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So that's with respect to that. On the 550, we adjust that rate accordingly. We haven't made that decision yet. But there is very nice demand for that, plus in particularly on the ISR space. So as long as there continue to be government customers, who see this as a powerful ISR system, and then we'll continue to produce those are fairly low level.

With respect to margins, a bit large I think in Marine. Yes, right now, our margin performance in the Marine Group is driven almost entirely by timing and mix of Electric Boat. You've got higher Block IV and Columbia class engineering volumes that lower margins offset by the lower Virginia Class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to, I think, we delivered a final ship. So if you recall, you've been with us now through 3 of these block transitions and remember, that we built the ships on a continuous learning curve. So it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we have got the operating excellence to move down our learning curve, and we've done that with all 3 ships, all 3 blocks. You can see some of that again on the -- on Block IV. There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming with Bach and NASSCO. Ultimately, margins can benefit as we, if you think about Columbia's, we decreased for engineering book and move more toward construction of Columbia but none of that will be clear until we get a contract in place on Columbia, and we don't think we're going to see that for the next year or so."

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and inco",2020,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and income from continuing operations of $864 million.
The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the text line. 
Against the year ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20% attributable in March prior to the CSRA acquisition, however, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All 5 reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter.
Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase.
The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction.
In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings, absent the amortization expense, related to the transaction were $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The 2 quarters were very much alike. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine Group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures of Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the 9 months, as the business units continue to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements. 
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year and $5.6 billion increase over the year ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine Group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2x and a sharp increase in estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4.
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter, revenue was up $36 million or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat of $5 million or 1.3% to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%.
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins as expected.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million or 6.4%, and operating earnings were of $133 million or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin.
The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measure in dollar values of orders, Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contract comms surrounding Nordam's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and 600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That I am pleased to say is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake.
Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelle, it is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter.
I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12-month basis, the book-to-bill was slightly in excess of 1:1. Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600, and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins.
The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just put that in some context. 4,400 nautical miles with the approximate range of its predecessor the G450 at 0.8 Mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The 600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 Mach have now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 Mach, actually quite stunning.
If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million or 1.5% but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike with no material difference in volume or profit.
Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million or 3.5%, despite a 50 basis point decline in operating margin. I should point out, the Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year ago quarter increases in revenue for 8 consecutive quarters.
All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 Configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all 9 brigades. We're also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements.
For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million or 7.6%.
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix.
Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-Class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With 4 recent awards for repair work, we should expect to step-up in volume for that category.
Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multiyear contract from the Navy for 4 DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords back the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY '19 through 2025.
We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in 2 segments: Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, Intelligence Agency and Federal Civil Agency. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue of $1.23 billion was $144 million or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date, revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or 6% increase.
I've already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth.
Moving to Information Technology. The business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1% excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year.
Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year ago quarter, but excluding the acquisition-related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%.
CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition cost. This was really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is down and continues to deliver early results.
Finally, we have announced the divestiture of our call centers to Maximus, as part of our portfolio shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well placed with maximum -- Maximus for homeosis core. Hey, by the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results.
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year is concerned, we fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions cost and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year, we you anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is now. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year.
The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piece me on next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, has been our custom for many years.
So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are going 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, that's particularly impressive during the year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing and the Marine group is steady as she goes and Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,585866400,1576431,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to",573,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million.
Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we're lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This imply the fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%.
One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue.
Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pretax GAAP P&L outcome, however, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target less the additional pension contribution.
Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter. The total company book-to-bill was 1.4x in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion, and when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive, given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment in particular, given its significant international footprint.
Specifically, over the first 9 months of the year, FX rate changes, driven by the strong dollar, reduced the segments backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless.
Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

You've got higher Block IV and Columbia-class engineering volumes and lower margins offset by the lower Virginia-Class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to, in fact, I think we delivered our final ship. So if you recall, you've been with us now through the 3 of these block transitions, and remember, that we bid these ships on a continuous learning curve.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and inco",2018,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and income from continuing operations of $864 million.
The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. 
Against the year ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20% attributable in March prior to the CSRA acquisition; however, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All 5 reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter.
Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase.
The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction.
In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings, absent the amortization expense related to the transaction, were $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The 2 quarters were very much alike. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine Group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures of Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the 9 months, as the business units continue to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements. 
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year and $5.6 billion increase over the year ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine Group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2x and a sharp increase in estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4.
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat off $5 million or 1.3% to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%.
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins as expected.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million or 6.4%, and operating earnings were off $133 million or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin.
The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measure in dollar values of orders, Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding Nordam's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and 600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That I am pleased to say is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake.
Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelle, it is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter.
I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12-month basis, the book-to-bill was slightly in excess of 1:1. Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600, and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins.
The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just put that in some context. 4,400 nautical miles with the approximate range of its predecessor the G450 at 0.8 Mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The 600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 Mach have now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 Mach, actually quite stunning.
If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million or 1.5% but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike with no material difference in volume or profit.
Year-to-date revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million or 3.5%, despite a 50 basis point decline in operating margin. I should point out the Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year-ago quarter increases in revenue for 8 consecutive quarters.
All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 Configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all 9 brigades. We are also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements.
For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million or 7.6%.
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix.
Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-Class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With 4 recent awards for repair work, we should expect to step up in volume for that category.
Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multiyear contract from the Navy for 4 DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords Bath the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY '19 through 2025.
We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in 2 segments: Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, Intelligence Agency and Federal Civil Agency. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue of $1.23 billion was $144 million or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or 6% increase.
I've already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth.
Moving to Information Technology. The business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1% excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year.
Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year ago quarter, but excluding the acquisition-related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%.
CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition cost. This was really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is sound and continues to deliver early results.
Finally, we have announced the divestiture of our call centers to Maximus as part of a portfolio shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well placed with maximum -- Maximus for homeosis core. Hey, by the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results.
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year is concerned? We fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions cost and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year.
The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years.
So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are growing 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, and that's particularly impressive during a year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing and the Marine group is steady as she goes and Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017.

That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million.
Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we're lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%.
One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue.
Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pretax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target less the additional pension contribution.
Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter. The total company book-to-bill was 1.4x in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion, and when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment in particular, given its significant international footprint.
Specifically, over the first 9 months of the year, FX rate changes, driven by the strong dollar, reduced the segments backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless.
Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

Yes, right now our margin performance in the Marine Group is driven almost entirely by timing and mix at Electric Boat. You've got higher Block IV and Columbia-class engineering volumes and lower margins offset by the lower Virginia-Class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to -- in fact, I think we delivered our final ship. So if you recall, you've been with us now through the 3 of these block transitions, and remember that we bid these ships on a continuous learning curve. So it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we've got the operating excellence to move down our learning curve, and we've done that with all 3 ships, or all 3 blocks, and you're just going to see some of that again on the -- on Block IV. There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming in Bath and NASSCO.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and inco",2018,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 per fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion and income from continuing operations of $864 million.
The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. 
Against the year ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20% attributable in March prior to the CSRA acquisition; however, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All 5 reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter.
Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase.
The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction.
In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings, absent the amortization expense related to the transaction, were $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The 2 quarters were very much alike. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine Group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures of Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the 9 months, as the business units continue to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements. 
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year and $5.6 billion increase over the year ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine Group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2x and a sharp increase in estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4.
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat off $5 million or 1.3% to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%.
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins as expected.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million or 6.4%, and operating earnings were off $133 million or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin.
The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measure in dollar values of orders, Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding Nordam's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and 600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That I am pleased to say is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake.
Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelle, it is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter.
I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12-month basis, the book-to-bill was slightly in excess of 1:1. Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600, and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins.
The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just put that in some context. 4,400 nautical miles with the approximate range of its predecessor the G450 at 0.8 Mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The 600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 Mach have now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 Mach, actually quite stunning.
If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million or 1.5% but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike with no material difference in volume or profit.
Year-to-date revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million or 3.5%, despite a 50 basis point decline in operating margin. I should point out the Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year-ago quarter increases in revenue for 8 consecutive quarters.
All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 Configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all 9 brigades. We are also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements.
For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million or 7.6%.
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix.
Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-Class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With 4 recent awards for repair work, we should expect to step up in volume for that category.
Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multiyear contract from the Navy for 4 DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords Bath the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY '19 through 2025.
We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in 2 segments: Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, Intelligence Agency and Federal Civil Agency. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue of $1.23 billion was $144 million or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or 6% increase.
I've already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth.
Moving to Information Technology. The business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1% excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year.
Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year ago quarter, but excluding the acquisition-related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%.
CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition cost. This was really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is sound and continues to deliver early results.
Finally, we have announced the divestiture of our call centers to Maximus as part of a portfolio shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well placed with maximum -- Maximus for homeosis core. Hey, by the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results.
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year is concerned? We fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions cost and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year.
The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years.
So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are growing 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, and that's particularly impressive during a year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing and the Marine group is steady as she goes and Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,585866400,1577262,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to",573,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million.
Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we're lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%.
One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue.
Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pretax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations.
Turning to capital deployment. We paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target less the additional pension contribution.
Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter. The total company book-to-bill was 1.4x in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion, and when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment in particular, given its significant international footprint.
Specifically, over the first 9 months of the year, FX rate changes, driven by the strong dollar, reduced the segment's backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless.
Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So all in all, we're comfortable with the implied guidance that we gave you back in January this year and that's about all I can go into at the moment until we set all of our production rates. So that's with respect to that. On the 550, we adjust that rate accordingly. We haven't made that decision yet. But there's very nice demand for that, plus -- well, in particularly in the ISR space. So as long as there continue to be government customers who see this as a powerful ISR system, and then we'll continue to produce those at fairly low level.

So if you recall, you've been with us now through the 3 of these block transitions, and remember that we bid these ships on a continuous learning curve. So it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we've got the operating excellence to move down our learning curve, and we've done that with all 3 ships, or all 3 blocks, and you're just going to see some of that again on the -- on Block IV. There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming in Bath and NASSCO. Ultimately, margins can benefit as we, if you think about Columbia's, we decrease our engineering work and move more toward construction of Columbia but none of that will be clear until we get a contract in place on Columbia. And we don't think we're going to see that for the next year or so."
