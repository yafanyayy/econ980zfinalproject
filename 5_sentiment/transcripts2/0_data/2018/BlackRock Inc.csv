Good morning, and happy new year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results.",1425,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and happy new year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results this morning. 
2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including $103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest close in our history. Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major regions and investment style. More importantly, our 2017 net asset close represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform. 
We continue to invest in our business while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points. And after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year. 
Full year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5.3 billion increased 13%. We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter, with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter. 
2017 as-adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1.3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The $1.3 billion net benefit was comprised of a $1.8 billion noncash tax benefit related to the reevaluation of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over 8 years. Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recent tax reform legislation. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $594 million were up substantially compared to 2016. 
Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016, led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital. Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume related and G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 33.9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher-average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II and tax reform as well as FX remeasurement expense, increased contingent payments and purchase price fair value adjustments. We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. 
BlackRock's record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business. 
During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth in our cash platform and 14% growth in our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44.1%. We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy. During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology-related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex asset management furthering our goal to be a solutions provider in Mexico and closing the acquisition of First Reserves Energy Infrastructure Funds, continuing to build that to our leading illiquid alternatives platform. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, and during 2017, returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased another $1.1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last 5 years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders. 
Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level. In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1.2 billion during 2018. 
Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018. 
Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%. Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full year organic growth of 19%, with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher-fee noncore exposures. Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds 5 years ago, we have seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone. 3 of the industry's top 5 ETFs in terms of net new assets globally this year were iShares core ETFs, IBV or S&P 500 Fund, IEFA for developed international market exposure, and IEMG, our core emerging markets fund. 
Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were paced by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and index equity. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and index strategies. 
2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments. BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins. 
Strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale. 
In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock. Our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients' needs. We believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflects long-term strategic advantages we've created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. BlackRock gen",1758,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflects long-term strategic advantages we've created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year. These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges, and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a 1-year period. They were driven by our ability to deliver complete investment solutions, industry-leading technology and thought leadership through an evolving investment landscape. 
Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy. 
Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty. After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth. In the U.S., strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the recent tax reform has continued to drive strong equity markets. And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher-growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%. Yet we're seeing a paradox of high returns, and yet we still see high anxiety. As past prices had instilled more caution in investors, the industry has seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower-risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over-allocate to cash and to other safe havens. However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run. As an example, an individual with $1,000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a U.S. bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950. Just as we believe in the importance in benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future perspective. 
We entered 2018, BlackRock's 30th year, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management. From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested over time to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today. 
In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock's technology is now used by clients in 50 countries, and more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader, as evidenced by over 8,000 media mentions received for the BlackRock Investment Institute in 2017. While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock's future. And we've just finished 2 days of meetings with BlackRock's Board of Directors, where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future. 
Our consistent investment in iShares and the broader ETF ecosystem has propelled BlackRock iShares franchise to more than $1.7 trillion of assets across 800 different funds. Record iShares inflows of $245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter, earned iShares the #1 share of global, U.S. and European flows for the year as well the #1 share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta. Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and tactical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership, and importantly, distribution technology. Growth has also been driven by increased adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals. And over the past 2 years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares have matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009. 
As we think about providing even more clients with the ability to use ETFs to deliver efficient model portfolios, we've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape. FutureAdvisor, our digital wealth offering in the U.S.; Scalable Capital, our strategic investment in Europe; both strengthened our relationships with intermediary partners, allowing them to effectively scale their businesses with a systematic investment process and ultimately expand the ETF market and iShares reach. 
Beyond digital wealth, technologies enabling work, productive engagements with more financial advisers than ever before, driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform. BlackRock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets. In 2017, in the U.S., for example, we have extended our reach to do our business with 25% more advisers and conducted nearly 1 million advisory engagements without meaningful increase in our cost base and distribution channel. 
We continue to invest in technology both organically and inorganically. Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested since the foundation of BlackRock, has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time. It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6.3 trillion today. Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth. And we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement. We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology such as iRetire, for example, to address the ongoing global retirement challenge. 
Technologies impacting businesses like cash management is wealth. And in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address corporate clients' cash management needs. Cachematrix allows BlackRock to provide a scalable technology solution to our bank clients while also expanding the reach of our cash management strategies. BlackRock saw $38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017, and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results. 
For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent durable alpha. 70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active assets, respectively, have performed above benchmark or peer medium for 1 year. And those numbers are 72% and 87% for a 3-year period of time. 
On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex asset management business. The combined firm broadens BlackRock's access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients access to BlackRock's international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative multi-asset solutions. We also focused on other high-growth geographies like China, where significant regulatory changes is opening up new opportunities for the future. Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high-net-worth individuals in China. With more assets under management on behalf of more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater. We have a responsibility to meet the clients' demands for investment strategies that will create a positive environmental and social impacts while generating strong financial returns. We recently hired Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to President Obama in energy, to lead our sustainable investment business, where we see a significant long-term opportunity for BlackRock worldwide. As a fiduciary, we have a responsibility to engage with companies in which we invest to ensure long-term value creation for clients. We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team, and we're building this team even further as we recognize the importance and value of a strong stewardship. Our team engaged with more than 1,600 companies in 2017 on a range of issues and voted on more than 17,000 shareholder meetings worldwide on more than 162,000 proposals. I give that out a lot of proposals. It is the dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positioned us well for 2018. Since BlackRock's foundings, we've encouraged everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm's culture. It's important that we continue to institutionalize that culture, especially as we prepare for the future for BlackRock. 
Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before. And we have no intentions of being -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving. But it's also a reality that we won't be here forever. And BlackRock's future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry. We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team. We recently implemented a key strategic part of that plan by issuing a onetime long-term equity incentive grant to a small group of senior leaders. These equity awards will vest over an extended period time frame of 5 to 7 years and are focused on ensuring the interest of the next-generation leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock's future. They are aligned with both clients and shareholders as much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years. 
As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

We participate in it. We watch it very closely. It's just part of the normal growth, I believe, of any product on a distribution platform. And also, the distribution platforms are changing themselves and becoming a lot more competitive. And when you add this, along with a lot of the regulatory issues that are looking at transparency and cost, this is all going to be very, very fluid."

So I would state that these changes that you're seeing in some of the distribution platforms plays very well into the BlackRock business model. We work with all the distribution platforms globally. The access that we are experiencing in Europe as they've consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side, and in the United States, the access that we are presenting, and it's evident by where some of the different distribution platforms are using models. They're utilizing many of BlackRock's models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs. So if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon. I don't even think it's a new phenomena for ETF, but that trend has been existing for years. And because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms. And we don't compete with our distribution partners."

So when we combine those 2 with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers who will have much better information both about the short term and long term. And actually, we're seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio. When we combine those 2, keep in mind, we're also combining the research both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method. And this has also worked very well for us in light of the MiFID II requirements, where, I'm not sure if people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research. So we're putting together the quantitative, the fundamental tools. We're putting together the research. The portfolio managers all have access.

I think we're going to speak for BlackRock, and we'll let the industries speak for themselves more broadly. But I think, from the top -- from the very top, we've obviously always been committed to investing in our business first and returning excess cash flow to shareholders. And as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So we've never been capital-constrained at all. And our capital management policies have not changed. We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio. And obviously, over time, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks. So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after-tax cash flow and obviously earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for, which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin. And decisions that we make around how much we're going to invest into our P&L and any, obviously, associated pricing investments that we may make going forward are really completely independent of our tax rate. We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions, and that reflects both potentially dividends and buybacks. And our plan is to -- I mean, given the tax reform is basically 3 weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations probably around mid-year once we kind of finalize the impact the tax reform is going to have on BlackRock, and there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming, as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products."

Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the IRA channel. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're using technology to provide better services, alongside our humans, to connect with our financial advisers, both the traditional ones and the IRA ones. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisers today than we did a year ago, but very little added in cost. So we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow up with human connectivity. So that probably the most -- the best example where we're bringing in more flows. The other area where we're bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model-based products and customizing it. And in those cases, much of the product flow in these model-based products would be flowing into our iShares spaces. And in terms of technology overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin for Wealth Management. We see increased inquiry in the institutional side. As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration. And we would expect the continuation of the growth rates of 14-ish percent going forward in our technology of platform. We're very encouraged, and we're very encouraged about bringing this all together, so it's not one thing. It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor, these are all connecting and creating more dialogue, deeper penetration. So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper, more consistent style of with more financial advisers. You mentioned Cachematrix. That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform. And that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017. And we expect the furthering of opportunities in our cash management business."

It's a portfolio solutions provider that they're using as part of a multi-asset class solution. It's the IRA channel, as you mentioned, who are also trying to customize solutions. And quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items. You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity. And now with all of the regulatory issues. And where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space because it's obviously much, much cheaper. So it's really, quite frankly, very, very broad-based, with the tail at the end of the year and start of the beginning of the year, coming more in fixed income than it is in equities and more in emerging markets because people are starting to allocate some of their monies outside of the U.S. for 2018. That happens to be a strategy across many of the distribution chains. So we're really participating all across the board. And lastly, I would say is people who are innovating now in the smart beta area because we have over 100 funds that are ETFs for smart beta.

So yes, higher year-over-year G&A and frankly also sequential G&A was driven by a number of what we would consider manageable core decisions that were obviously very conscious, like technology, data and obviously some occupancy as our headcount is growing. And the higher annual G&A expense, which is up about 12%, clearly reflected, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data. The annual -- the year-over-year, the sequential -- all 3, frankly, also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items. We try to highlight some of those professional fees related to a bunch of things. We had M&A activity during the year. We had Brexit planning. We had MiFID II planning. We had a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX remeasurement expense. We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some prior deals. And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments. And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means of those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing better. That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last 5 years, and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale. We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time. I think the important thing that we're trying to convey here is that you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base, and there's obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense. We're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base. And you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline. And we don't think any of that will basically impact the -- in stable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin."

And the conversation that I had with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question. Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is underappreciated, and I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long-term investor because I think people are living longer, are in a state of retirement longer. So the need to invest in longer-duration assets has never been greater. I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the 10 30 [indiscernible] 40 basis points, obviously, that's an inflation reflection, too. But the demand for long-dated assets remains really strong. And look at that credit spreads. And one of the examples why equity markets remain to be very robust worldwide, demand for long-dated financial assets remains to be strong. So one, it means continuation of -- I think this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it, and we're seeing different -- we, in our LifePath product, we've extended the life of some of the -- LifePath extended ownership of equities longer some of our LifePath products. But as I said, the demand from institutional for long-dated assets remains to be quite robust. The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they're in the deaccumulation phase. What type of advice? How can individuals really have great financial literacy and financial assistance during the deaccumulation phase of retirement. I think this is one of the big issues of some of this anxiety that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. I also believe there is so many people in the world sitting at 50 years old that are unprepared because of the underinvestment in their retirement and the over-dependency of cash and bonds. It's how that's playing. We just finished a 2-day board meeting. We talked about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on. You brought up one important point that we are working on, and that is how do we transform retirement in the world. That is one of BlackRock's long-term strategies, and that intersects with technologies, that intersects with our business in the United States, our business in Europe, our future business in China. So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around deaccumulation. And I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised. And hopefully, we can design products that meet those types of needs. I think, as an industry, we're not there yet. I would also say, in society, we're not there yet. There's not enough debate here in the United States. There's not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of deaccumulation."

So we have a very large trading staff. Every one of them is involved in the electronic trading business. And we'll be continuing going forward. And this is really an important part of also our Aladdin, where we're helping others who don't have that electronic execution capabilities to have it through our technology."

We look at technology as a major component of how we have our trading platform. If you look at the scale of our platform today versus our scale of 5 years ago, one of the -- and why our margins have increased as a firm systematically, is a technology that we utilize and the operations of platform. And the trading platform that we have today is mostly driven through technology. And that's one of the great advantages -- and that's one of the great advantages that we have related to Aladdin and why so many clients are looking to employ Aladdin because the need of having greater efficiencies in the operations of trading is becoming more and more important. And for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too high cost. And as fees are coming down, and if you don't have those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind. And I would also say, one of the most important things about electronic trading and utilization of Aladdin, it brings down operational errors. So it is a major component of what we do, and we're very proud of the trading platform that we created and the efficiencies that it has created for us in behalf of our clients. 
Let me just close and thank everybody for joining this morning our end of the year call. Our 2017 results are directly linked to the investments we've made over time. And importantly, I do believe the results that you're seeing in terms of our flows is a direct result of the trust that clients have placed on BlackRock. We will continue to leverage our differentiating scale and invest in our technology, invest in the value proposition for our client, and importantly, create a great value proposition for our shareholders. I'd like to thank everyone in this call and wish everybody a happy new year. And hopefully, our year continues as robust as it has in the first 12 days of the year. Have a good one."

Good morning, and happy new year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.

It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results this morning. 
2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including $103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest close in our history. Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major region and investment style. More importantly, our 2017 net asset close represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform. 
We continue to invest in our business, while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points. And after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year. 
Full year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5.3 billion increased 13%. We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter.
2017 as-adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1.3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The $1.3 billion net benefit was comprised of a $1.8 billion noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over 8 years. Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on, or changes to our analysis of, recent tax reform legislation. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $594 million were up substantially compared to 2016. 
Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016, led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management.
We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital. Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume-related and G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 33.9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher-average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II and tax reform as well as FX remeasurement expense, increased contingent payments and purchase price fair value adjustments. 
We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. 
BlackRock's record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business. 
During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth on our cash platform and 14% growth on our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44.1%. We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.
Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy. During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology-related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico and closing the acquisition of First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, continuing to build that of our leading illiquid alternatives platform. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and, during 2017, returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased another $1.1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last 5 years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders. 
Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level. In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1.2 billion during 2018. 
Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018. 
Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%. Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. 
Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full year organic growth of 19% with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher-fee noncore exposures. Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds 5 years ago, we have seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone. 3 of the industry's top 5 ETFs, in terms of net new assets globally this year, were iShares core ETFs; IBV or S&P 500 Fund; IEFA for developed international market exposure; and IEMG, our core emerging markets fund. 
Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were paced by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and index equity. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and index strategies. 
2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments. BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins. 
Strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale. 
In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock. Our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients' needs. We believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. BlackRoc",1773,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year. These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges, and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a one-year period. They were driven by our ability to deliver complete investment solutions, industry-leading technology and thought leadership through an evolving investment landscape. 
Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy. 
Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty. After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth. In the U.S., strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the recent tax reform has continued to drive strong equity markets. And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher-growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%. Yet we are seeing a paradox of high returns, and yet we still see high anxiety. As past prices had been instilled more caution in investors, the industry have seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower-risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over-allocate to cash and to other safe havens. 
However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run. As an example, an individual with $1,000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a U.S. bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950. Just as we believe on the importance in benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future perspective. 
We entered 2018, BlackRock's 30th year, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management. From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested, over time, to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today. 
In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock's technology is now used by clients in 50 countries. And more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader, as evidenced by over 8,000 media mentions received for the BlackRock Investment Institute in 2017. 
While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock's future. And we've just finished 2 days of meetings with BlackRock's Board of Directors, where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future. 
Our consistent investment in iShares and the broader ETF ecosystem has propelled BlackRock iShares franchise to more than $1.7 trillion of assets across 800 different funds. Record iShares inflows of $245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter, earned iShares the #1 share of global, U.S. and European flows for the year as well the #1 share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta. 
Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and technical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership and, importantly, distribution technology. Growth has also been driven by increased adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals. And over the past 2 years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares has matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009. 
As we think about providing even more clients with the ability to use ETFs to deliver efficient model portfolios, we've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape. FutureAdvisor, our digital wealth offering in the U.S.; Scalable Capital, our strategic investment in Europe; both strengthened our relationships with intermediary partners, allowing them to effectively scale their businesses with a systematic investment process and ultimately expand the ETF market and iShares reach. 
Beyond digital wealth, technology is enabling more productive engagements with more financial advisers than ever before, driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform. BlackRock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets. In 2017, in the U.S., for example, we extended our reach to do our business with 25% more advisers and conducted nearly 1 million advisory engagements without meaningful increasing our cost base in this distribution channel. 
We continue to invest in technology, both organically and inorganically. Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested in since the foundation of BlackRock, has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time. It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6.3 trillion today. Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth. And we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement. We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology, such as iRetire, for example, to address the ongoing global retirement challenge. 
Technologies impacting businesses like cash management is wealth. And in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address their corporate clients' cash management needs. Cachematrix allows BlackRock to provide a scalable technology solution to our bank clients, while also expanding the reach of our cash management strategies. BlackRock saw $38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017, and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets, as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results. 
For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent durable alpha. 70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active equity assets, respectively, have performed above benchmark or peer medium for one year. And those numbers are 72% and 87% for a 3-year period of time. 
On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex asset management business. The combined firm broadens BlackRock's access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients access to BlackRock's international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative multi-asset solutions. 
We also focus on other high-growth geographies like China, where significant regulatory changes is opening up new opportunities for the future. Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high net worth individuals in China. 
With more assets under management on behalf of more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater. We have a responsibility to meet the clients' demands for investment strategies that will create a positive environmental and social impact, while generating strong financial returns. We recently hired Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to President Obama on climate and energy, to lead our sustainable investment business where we see a significant long-term opportunity for BlackRock worldwide. 
As a fiduciary, we have a responsibility to engage with companies in which we invest to ensure long-term value creation for clients. We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team, and we're building this team even further as we recognize the growing importance and value of a strong stewardship. 
Our team engaged with more than 1,600 companies in 2017 on a range of issues and voted on more than 17,000 shareholder meetings worldwide on more than 162,000 proposals. Get that out, that was a lot of proposals. It is the dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positioned us well for 2018. Since BlackRock's foundings, we have been encouraged everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm's culture. It is important that we continue to institutionalize that culture, especially as we prepare for the future for BlackRock.
Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before. And we have no intentions of being -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving. But it's also a reality that we won't be here forever. And BlackRock's future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry. We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team. We recently implemented a key strategic part of that plan by issuing a onetime, long-term equity incentive grant to a small group of senior leaders. These equity awards will vest over an extended period time frame of 5 to 7 years and are focused on ensuring the interest of the next-generation leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock's future. They are aligned with both clients and shareholders, much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years. 
As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent, so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And also the distribution platforms are changing themselves and becoming a lot more competitive.

So I would state that these changes that you're seeing in some of the distribution platforms plays very well into the BlackRock business model. We work with all the distribution platforms globally. The access that we are experiencing in Europe, as they've consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side, and in the United States, the access that we are presenting, and it's evident by the -- where some of the different distribution platforms are using models, they're utilizing many of BlackRock's models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs. So if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon. I don't even think it's a new phenomenon for ETF, but that trend has been existing for years. And because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms. And we don't compete with our distribution partners."

So when we combine those 2 with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers who will have much better information, both about the short term and the long term. And actually, we're seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio. When we combined those 2, keep in mind, we're also combining the research, both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method. And this has also worked very well for us, in light of the MiFID II requirements, where, I'm not sure if people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research.

I think we're going to speak for BlackRock. We'll let the industries speak for themselves more broadly. But I think, from the top -- from the very top, we've obviously always been committed to investing on our business first and returning excess cash flow to shareholders. And as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So we've never been capital-constrained at all. And our capital management policies have not changed. We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and, obviously, over time, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks. So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after-tax cash flow and, obviously, earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for, which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin. And decisions that we make around how much we're going to invest into our P&L and any, obviously, associated pricing investments that we may make going forward are really completely independent of our tax rate. We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions, and that reflects both potential dividends and buybacks. And our plan is to -- I mean, given the tax reform is basically 3 weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations probably around mid-year once we kind of finalize the impact the tax reform is going to have on BlackRock. And there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products."

Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the IRA channel. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're using technology to provide better services, alongside our humans, to connect with our financial advisers, both the traditional ones and the IRA ones. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisers today than we did a year ago with very little added in cost. And it -- so we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow up with human connectivity. So that probably the most -- the best example where we're bringing in more flows. The other area where we're bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model-based products and customizing it. And in those cases, much of the product flow in these model-based products would be flowing into our iShares spaces. In terms of technology, overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin for Wealth Management. We see increased inquiry in the institutional side. As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration. And we would expect the continuation of the growth rates of 14-ish percent going forward in our technology platform. We're very encouraged. And we're very encouraged about bringing this all together, so it -- it's not one thing. It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor, these are all connecting and creating more dialogue, deeper penetration. So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper or consistent dialogue with more financial advisers. You mentioned Cachematrix. That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform. And that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017. And we expect a further -- furthering of opportunities in our cash management business."

It's portfolio solutions provider that are using it as part of a multi-asset class solution. It's the IRA channel, as you mentioned, who are also trying to customize solutions. And quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items. You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items of portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity. And now with all of the regulatory issues and where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space because it's obviously much, much cheaper. So it's really, quite frankly, very, very broad-based with the tail at the end of the year and start of the beginning of the year, coming more in fixed income than it is in equities and more in emerging markets because people are starting to allocate some of their monies outside of the U.S. for 2018. That happens to be a strategy across many of the distribution chains. So we're really participating all across the board. And lastly, I would say is people who are innovating now in the smart beta area because we have over 100 funds that are ETFs for smart beta. So this is a market that really is still in the early stages. And every day, we have another client that comes in and finds another use for it.

So yes, higher year-over-year G&A and, frankly, also sequential G&A was driven by a number of what we would consider manageable core decisions that were obviously very conscious, like technology, data, M&P, obviously, some occupancy as our headcount is growing. And the higher annual G&A expense, which is up about 12%, clearly reflected, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data. The annual, the year-over-year, the sequential, all 3, frankly, also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items. We try to highlight some of those. Professional fees were higher related to a bunch of things. We had M&A activity during the year. We had Brexit planning. We have MiFID II planning. We have a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX remeasurement expense. We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some of our prior deals. And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments. And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means that those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing better. That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last 5 years, and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale. We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time. I think the important thing for -- that we're trying to convey here is that you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base. And there's obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense. As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base. And you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline. And we don't think any of that will basically impact the -- in stable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin."

And the conversations that I have with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question. Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is not -- is underappreciated. And I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long-term investor because I think people are living longer or in the state of retirement longer. So the need to invest in longer duration in assets has never been greater. I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the 10, 30s or 40 basis points, obviously, that's an inflation reflection, too. But the demand for long-dated assets remains really strong. And look at that credit spreads. And one of the examples why equity markets remain to be very robust worldwide, demand for long-dated financial assets remains to be strong. So one, it means continuation of -- and I think this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it, and we're seeing different -- we, in our LifePath products, we've extended the life of some of the -- LifePaths -- we've extended ownership of equities longer in some of our LifePath products. But like as I said, the demand from institutional client for long-dated assets remains to be quite robust. The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they are in the deaccumulation phase. What type of advice? How can individuals really have great financial literacy and financial assistance during the deaccumulation phase of retirement? I think this is one of the big issues of some of this anxiety that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. I also believe there are so many people in the world who are sitting at 50 years old that are unprepared because of the underinvestment in their retirement and the over-dependency of cash and bonds. It's how that's playing. We just finished a 2-day board meeting. We talked about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on. You brought up one important point that we are working on, and that is how do we transform retirement in the world. That is one of BlackRock's long-term strategies, and that intersects with technology, that intersects with our business in the United States, our business in Europe, our future business in China. So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around deaccumulation. And I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised. And hopefully, we can design products that meet those types of needs. I think, as an industry, we're not there yet. I would also say, in society, we're not there yet. There's not enough debate here in the United States. There's not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of deaccumulation."

We look at technology as a major component of how we have our trading platform. If you look at the scale of our platform today versus our scale of 5 years ago, one of the -- and why our margins have increased as a firm systematically is the technology that we utilize and the operations of our platform. And the trading platform that we have today is mostly driven through technology. And that's one of the great advantages that we have related to Aladdin and why so many clients are looking to employ Aladdin because the need of having greater efficiencies in the operations of trading is becoming more and more important. And for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too high a cost. And as fees are coming down and if you don't have that -- those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind. And I would also say, one of the most important things about electronic trading and utilization of Aladdin, it's -- it brings down operational errors. So it is a major component of what we do. And we're very proud of the trading platform that we created and the efficiencies that it has created for us on behalf of our clients. 
Let me just close and thank everybody for joining this morning, our end of the year call. Our 2017 results are directly linked to the investments we've made over time. And importantly, I do believe the results that you're seeing in terms of our flows is a direct result of the trust that clients have placed on BlackRock. We will continue to leverage our differentiating scale and invest in our technology, invest in the value proposition for our client and, importantly, create a great value proposition for our shareholders. I'd like to thank everyone who are in this call and wish everybody a happy new year. And hopefully, our year continues as robust as it has in the first 12 days of the year. Have a good one."

It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results this morning. 
2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including $103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest flows in our history. Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major region and investment style. More importantly, our 2017 net asset flows represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform. 
We continue to invest in our business, while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points. And after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year. 
Full year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5.3 billion increased 13%. We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter.
2017 as-adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1.3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The $1.3 billion net benefit was comprised of a $1.8 billion noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over 8 years. Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on, or changes to our analysis of, recent tax reform legislation. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $594 million were up substantially compared to 2016. 
Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016, led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management.
We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital. Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume-related and G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 33.9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher-average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II and tax reform as well as FX remeasurement expense, increased contingent payments and purchase price fair value adjustments. 
We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. 
BlackRock's record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business. 
During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth in our cash platform and 14% growth in our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44.1%. We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.
Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy. During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology-related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico and closing the acquisition of First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, continuing to build that of our leading illiquid alternatives platform. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and, during 2017, returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased another $1.1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last 5 years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders. 
Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level. In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1.2 billion during 2018. 
Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018. 
Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%. Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. 
Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full year organic growth of 19% with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher-fee noncore exposures. Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds 5 years ago, we have seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone. 3 of the industry's top 5 ETFs, in terms of net new assets globally this year, were iShares core ETFs; IBV, our S&P 500 Fund; IEFA for developed international market exposure; and IEMG, our core emerging markets fund. 
Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were paced by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and indexed equity. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and index strategies. 
2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments. BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins. 
Strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale. 
In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock. Our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients' needs. We believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect the long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs.

The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect the long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year. These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges, and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a 1-year period. They were driven by our ability to deliver complete investment solutions, industry-leading technology and thought leadership through an evolving investment landscape. 
Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy. 
Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty. After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth. In the U.S., strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the recent tax reform has continued to drive strong equity markets. And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher-growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%. Yet we are seeing a paradox of high returns, and yet we still see high anxiety. As past prices instills more caution in investors, the industry have seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower-risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over-allocate to cash and to other safe havens. 
However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run. As an example, an individual with $1,000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a U.S. bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950. Just as we believe in the importance in benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future perspective. 
We entered 2018, BlackRock's 30th year, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management. From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested, over time, to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today. 
In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock's technology is now used by clients in 50 countries. And more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader, as evidenced by over 8,000 media mentions received for the BlackRock Investment Institute in 2017. 
While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock's future. And we've just finished 2 days of meetings with BlackRock's Board of Directors, where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future. 
Our consistent investment in iShares and the broader ETF ecosystem has propelled BlackRock iShares franchise to more than $1.7 trillion of assets across 800 different funds. Record iShares inflows of $245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter, earned iShares the #1 share of global, U.S. and European flows for the year as well the #1 share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta. 
Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and technical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership and, importantly, distribution technology. Growth has also been driven by increased adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals. And over the past 2 years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares has matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009. 
As we think about providing even more clients with the ability to use ETFs to deliver efficient model portfolios, we've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape. FutureAdvisor, our digital wealth offering in the U.S.; Scalable Capital, our strategic investment in Europe; both strengthened our relationships with intermediary partners, allowing them to effectively scale their businesses with a systematic investment process and ultimately expand the ETF market and iShares reach. 
Beyond digital wealth, technology is enabling more productive engagements with more financial advisers than ever before, driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform. BlackRock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets. In 2017, in the U.S., for example, we extended our reach to do our business with 25% more advisers and conducted nearly 1 million advisory engagements without meaningful increasing our cost base in this distribution channel. 
We continue to invest in technology, both organically and inorganically. Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested in since the foundation of BlackRock, has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time. It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6.3 trillion today. Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth. And we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement. We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology, such as iRetire, for example, to address the ongoing global retirement challenge. 
Technologies impacting businesses like cash management is wealth. And in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address their corporate clients' cash management needs. Cachematrix allows BlackRock to provide a scalable technology solution to our bank clients, while also expanding the reach of our cash management strategies. BlackRock saw $38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017, and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets, as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results. 
For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent durable alpha. 70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active equity assets, respectively, have performed above benchmark or peer medium for 1 year. And those numbers are 72% and 87% for a 3-year period of time. 
On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex asset management business. The combined firm broadens BlackRock's access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients access to BlackRock's international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative multi-asset solutions. 
We also focus on other high-growth geographies like China, where significant regulatory changes is opening up new opportunities for the future. Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high net worth individuals in China. 
With more assets under management on behalf of a more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater. We have a responsibility to meet the clients' demands for investment strategies that will create a positive environmental and social impact, while generating strong financial returns. We recently hired Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to President Obama on climate and energy, to lead our sustainable investment business where we see a significant long-term opportunity for BlackRock worldwide. 
As a fiduciary, we have a responsibility to engage with companies in which we invest to ensure long-term value creation for clients. We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team, and we're building this team even further as we recognize the growing importance and value of a strong stewardship. 
Our team engaged with more than 1,600 companies in 2017 on a range of issues and voted on more than 17,000 shareholder meetings worldwide on more than 162,000 proposals. I had to get that out, that was a lot of proposals. It is the dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positioned us well for 2018. Since BlackRock's foundings, we have been encouraged everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm's culture. It is important that we continue to institutionalize that culture, especially as we prepare for the future for BlackRock.
Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before. And we have no intentions of being -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving. But it's also a reality that we won't be here forever. And BlackRock's future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry. We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team. We recently implemented a key strategic part of that plan by issuing a onetime, long-term equity incentive grant to a small group of senior leaders. These equity awards will vest over an extended period time frame of 5 to 7 years and are focused on ensuring the interest of the next-generational leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock's future. They are aligned with both clients and shareholders, much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years. 
As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent, so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

The access that we are experiencing in Europe, as they've consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side, and in the United States, the access that we are presenting, and it's evident by the -- where some of the different distribution platforms are using models, they're utilizing many of BlackRock's models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs. So if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon. I don't even think it's a new phenomenon for ETF, but that trend has been existing for years. And because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms. And we don't compete with our distribution partners."

And if you look at fundamentals, there's a lot of work that's on long-term signals. It just makes sense to us to combine the 2 because they both are related to each other. So when we combine those 2 with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers who will have much better information, both about the short term and the long term. And actually, we're seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio. When we combined those 2, keep in mind, we're also combining the research, both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method. And this has also worked very well for us, in light of the MiFID II requirements, where, I'm not sure if people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research. So we're putting together the quantitative, the fundamental tools. We're putting together the research. The portfolio managers all have access.

I think we're going to speak for BlackRock. We'll let the industries speak for themselves more broadly. But I think, from the top -- from the very top, we've obviously always been committed to investing on our business first and returning excess cash flow to shareholders. And as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So we've never been capital-constrained at all. And our capital management policies have not changed. We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and, obviously, over time, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks. So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after-tax cash flow and, obviously, earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for, which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin. And decisions that we make around how much we're going to invest into our P&L and any, obviously, associated pricing investments that we may make going forward are really completely independent of our tax rate. We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions, and that reflects both potential dividends and buybacks. And our plan is to -- I mean, given the tax reform is basically 3 weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations probably around mid-year once we kind of finalize the impact the tax reform is going to have on BlackRock. And there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products."

Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the IRA channel. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're using technology to provide better services, alongside our humans, to connect with our financial advisers, both the traditional ones and the IRA ones. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisers today than we did a year ago with very little added in cost. And it -- so we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow up with human connectivity. So that probably the most -- the best example where we're bringing in more flows -- the other area where we're bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model-based products and customizing it. And in those cases, much of the product flow in these model-based products would be flowing into our iShares spaces. In terms of technology, overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin for Wealth Management. We see increased inquiry in the institutional side. As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration. And we would expect the continuation of the growth rates of 14-ish percent going forward in our technology platform. We're very encouraged. And we're very encouraged about bringing this all together, so it -- it's not one thing. It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor, these are all connecting and creating more dialogue, deeper penetration. So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper or consistent dialogue with more financial advisers. You mentioned Cachematrix. That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform. And that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017. And we expect a further -- furthering of opportunities in our cash management business."

It's portfolio solutions provider that are using it as part of a multi-asset class solution. It's the IRA channel, as you mentioned, who are also trying to customize solutions. And quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items. You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items of portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity. And now with all of the regulatory issues and where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space because it's obviously much, much cheaper. So it's really, quite frankly, very, very broad-based with the tail at the end of the year and start of the beginning of the year, coming more in fixed income than it is in equities and more in emerging markets because people are starting to allocate some of their monies outside of the U.S. for 2018. That happens to be a strategy across many of the distribution chains. So we're really participating all across the board. And lastly, I would say is people who are innovating now in the smart beta area because we have over 100 funds that are ETFs for smart beta.

So yes, higher year-over-year G&A and, frankly, also sequential G&A was driven by a number of what we would consider manageable core decisions that were obviously very conscious, like technology, data, M&P, obviously, some occupancy as our headcount is growing. And the higher annual G&A expense, which is up about 12%, clearly reflected, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data. The annual, the year-over-year, the sequential, all 3, frankly, also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items. We try to highlight some of those. Professional fees were higher related to a bunch of things. We had M&A activity during the year. We had Brexit planning. We have MiFID II planning. We have a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX remeasurement expense. We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some of our prior deals. And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments. And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means that those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing better. That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last 5 years, and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale. We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time. I think the important thing for -- that we're trying to convey here is that you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base. And there's obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense. As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base. And you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline. And we don't think any of that will basically impact the -- in stable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin."

And the conversations that I have with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question. Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is not -- is underappreciated. And I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long-term investor because I think people are living longer or in the state of retirement longer. So the need to invest in longer duration in assets has never been greater. I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the 10, 30s or 40 basis points, obviously, that's an inflation reflection, too. But the demand for long-dated assets remains really strong. And look at that in credit spreads. And one of the examples why equity markets remain to be very robust. Worldwide, demand for long-dated financial assets remains to be strong. So one, it means continuation of -- and I think this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it, and we're seeing different -- we, in our LifePath products, we've extended the life of some of the -- LifePaths -- we've extended ownership of equities longer in some of our LifePath products. But like as I said, the demand from institutional client for long-dated assets remains to be quite robust. The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they are in the deaccumulation phase. What type of advice? How can individuals really have great financial literacy and financial assistance during the deaccumulation phase of retirement? I think this is one of the big issues of some of this anxiety that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. I also believe there are so many people in the world who are sitting at 50 years old that are unprepared because of the underinvestment in their retirement and the over-dependency of cash and bonds. It's how that's playing. We just finished a 2-day board meeting. We talked about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on. You brought up one important point that we are working on, and that is how do we transform retirement in the world. That is one of BlackRock's long-term strategies, and that intersects with technology, that intersects with our business in the United States, our business in Europe, our future business in China. So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around deaccumulation. And I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised. And hopefully, we can design products that meet those types of needs. I think, as an industry, we're not there yet. I would also say, in society, we're not there yet. There's not enough debate here in the United States. There's not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of deaccumulation."

We look at technology as a major component of how we have our trading platform. If you look at the scale of our platform today versus our scale of 5 years ago, one of the -- and why our margins have increased as a firm systematically is the technology that we utilize and the operations of our platform. And the trading platform that we have today is mostly driven through technology. And that's one of the great advantages that we have related to Aladdin and why so many clients are looking to employ Aladdin because the need of having greater efficiencies in the operations of trading is becoming more and more important. And for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too high a cost. And as fees are coming down and if you don't have that -- those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind. And I would also say, one of the most important things about electronic trading and utilization of Aladdin, it's -- it brings down operational errors. So it is a major component of what we do. And we're very proud of the trading platform that we created and the efficiencies that it has created for us on behalf of our clients. 
Let me just close and thank everybody for joining this morning, our end of the year call. Our 2017 results are directly linked to the investments we've made over time. And importantly, I do believe the results that you're seeing in terms of our flows is a direct result of the trust that clients have placed on BlackRock. We will continue to leverage our differentiating scale and invest in our technology, invest in the value proposition for our client and, importantly, create a great value proposition for our shareholders. I'd like to thank everyone who are in this call and wish everybody a happy New Year. And hopefully, our year continues as robust as it has in the first 12 days of the year. Have a good one."

Good morning, and happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results.",1425,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results this morning. 
2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including $103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest flows in our history. Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major region and investment style. More importantly, our 2017 net asset flows represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform. 
We continue to invest in our business, while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points. And after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year. 
Full year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5.3 billion increased 13%. We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21%, respectively, versus the year-ago quarter.
2017 as-adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1.3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The $1.3 billion net benefit was comprised of a $1.8 billion noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over 8 years. Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on, or changes to our analysis of, recent tax reform legislation. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $594 million were up substantially compared to 2016. 
Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016, led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management.
We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital. Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume-related and G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 33.9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher-average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II and tax reform as well as FX remeasurement expense, increased contingent payments and purchase price fair value adjustments. 
We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. 
BlackRock's record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business. 
During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth in our cash platform and 14% growth in our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44.1%. We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.
Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy. During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology-related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico and closing the acquisition of First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, continuing to build that of our leading illiquid alternatives platform. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and, during 2017, returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased another $1.1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last 5 years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders. 
Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level. In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1.2 billion during 2018. 
Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018. 
Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%. Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. 
Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full year organic growth of 19% with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher-fee noncore exposures. Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds 5 years ago, we have seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone. 3 of the industry's top 5 ETFs, in terms of net new assets globally this year, were iShares core ETFs; IBV, our S&P 500 Fund; IEFA for developed international market exposure; and IEMG, our core emerging markets fund. 
Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were paced by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and indexed equity. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and index strategies. 
2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments. BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins. 
Strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale. 
In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock. Our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients' needs. We believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect the long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. Blac",1776,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock's 2017 results reflect the long-term strategic advantages we have created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients' changing needs. 
BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year. These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges, and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a 1-year period. They were driven by our ability to deliver complete investment solutions, industry-leading technology and thought leadership through an evolving investment landscape. 
Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy. 
Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty. After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth. In the U.S., strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the recent tax reform has continued to drive strong equity markets. And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher-growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%. Yet we are seeing a paradox of high returns, and yet we still see high anxiety. As past prices instills more caution in investors, the industry have seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower-risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over-allocate to cash and to other safe havens. 
However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run. As an example, an individual with $1,000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a U.S. bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950. Just as we believe in the importance in benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future perspective. 
We entered 2018, BlackRock's 30th year, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management. From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested, over time, to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today. 
In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock's technology is now used by clients in 50 countries. And more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader, as evidenced by over 8,000 media mentions received for the BlackRock Investment Institute in 2017. 
While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock's future. And we've just finished 2 days of meetings with BlackRock's Board of Directors, where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future. 
Our consistent investment in iShares and the broader ETF ecosystem has propelled BlackRock iShares franchise to more than $1.7 trillion of assets across 800 different funds. Record iShares inflows of $245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter, earned iShares the #1 share of global, U.S. and European flows for the year as well the #1 share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta. 
Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and technical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership and, importantly, distribution technology. Growth has also been driven by increased adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals. And over the past 2 years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares has matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009. 
As we think about providing even more clients with the ability to use ETFs to deliver efficient model portfolios, we've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape. FutureAdvisor, our digital wealth offering in the U.S.; Scalable Capital, our strategic investment in Europe; both strengthened our relationships with intermediary partners, allowing them to effectively scale their businesses with a systematic investment process and ultimately expand the ETF market and iShares reach. 
Beyond digital wealth, technology is enabling more productive engagements with more financial advisers than ever before, driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform. BlackRock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets. In 2017, in the U.S., for example, we extended our reach to do our business with 25% more advisers and conducted nearly 1 million advisory engagements without meaningful increasing our cost base in this distribution channel. 
We continue to invest in technology, both organically and inorganically. Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested in since the foundation of BlackRock, has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time. It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6.3 trillion today. Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth. And we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement. We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology, such as iRetire, for example, to address the ongoing global retirement challenge. 
Technologies impacting businesses like cash management is wealth. And in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address their corporate clients' cash management needs. Cachematrix allows BlackRock to provide a scalable technology solution to our bank clients, while also expanding the reach of our cash management strategies. BlackRock saw $38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017, and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets, as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results. 
For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent durable alpha. 70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active equity assets, respectively, have performed above benchmark or peer medium for 1 year. And those numbers are 72% and 87% for a 3-year period of time. 
On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex asset management business. The combined firm broadens BlackRock's access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients access to BlackRock's international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative multi-asset solutions. 
We also focus on other high-growth geographies like China, where significant regulatory changes is opening up new opportunities for the future. Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high net worth individuals in China. 
With more assets under management on behalf of a more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater. We have a responsibility to meet the clients' demands for investment strategies that will create a positive environmental and social impact, while generating strong financial returns. We recently hired Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to President Obama on climate and energy, to lead our sustainable investment business where we see a significant long-term opportunity for BlackRock worldwide. 
As a fiduciary, we have a responsibility to engage with companies in which we invest to ensure long-term value creation for clients. We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team, and we're building this team even further as we recognize the growing importance and value of a strong stewardship. 
Our team engaged with more than 1,600 companies in 2017 on a range of issues and voted on more than 17,000 shareholder meetings worldwide on more than 162,000 proposals. I had to get that out, that was a lot of proposals. It is the dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positioned us well for 2018. Since BlackRock's foundings, we have been encouraged everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm's culture. It is important that we continue to institutionalize that culture, especially as we prepare for the future for BlackRock.
Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before. And we have no intentions of being -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving. But it's also a reality that we won't be here forever. And BlackRock's future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry. We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team. We recently implemented a key strategic part of that plan by issuing a onetime, long-term equity incentive grant to a small group of senior leaders. These equity awards will vest over an extended period time frame of 5 to 7 years and are focused on ensuring the interest of the next-generational leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock's future. They are aligned with both clients and shareholders, much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years. 
As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent, so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect.

So 2 examples. Ameritrade has changed access on its -- to its ETFs on its commission-free platform, and some ETF providers got kicked off and others got brought on. And then Vanguard has gotten kicked off a number of large platforms because they don't play the platform fees. So does access to ETF distribution play out differently for ETFs than access for mutual fund distributions -- distribution, sorry? How does this shape the competitive landscape for ETFs? And then, I guess, lastly, does this drive consolidation in ETFs?"

We participate in it. We watch it very closely. It's just part of the normal growth, I believe, of any product on a distribution platform. And also the distribution platforms are changing themselves and becoming a lot more competitive. And when you add this, along with a lot of the regulatory issues that are looking at transparency and cost, this is all going to be very, very fluid."

So I would state that these changes that you're seeing in some of the distribution platforms plays very well into the BlackRock business model. We work with all the distribution platforms globally. The access that we are experiencing in Europe, as they've consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side, and in the United States, the access that we are presenting, and it's evident by the -- where some of the different distribution platforms are using models, they're utilizing many of BlackRock's models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs. So if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon. I don't even think it's a new phenomenon for ETF, but that trend has been existing for years. And because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms. And we don't compete with our distribution partners."

So when we combine those 2 with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers who will have much better information, both about the short term and the long term. And actually, we're seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio. When we combined those 2, keep in mind, we're also combining the research, both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method. And this has also worked very well for us, in light of the MiFID II requirements, where, I'm not sure if people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research.

I think we're going to speak for BlackRock. We'll let the industries speak for themselves more broadly. But I think, from the top -- from the very top, we've obviously always been committed to investing on our business first and returning excess cash flow to shareholders. And as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So we've never been capital-constrained at all. And our capital management policies have not changed. We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and, obviously, over time, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks. So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after-tax cash flow and, obviously, earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for, which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin. And decisions that we make around how much we're going to invest into our P&L and any, obviously, associated pricing investments that we may make going forward are really completely independent of our tax rate. We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions, and that reflects both potential dividends and buybacks. And our plan is to -- I mean, given the tax reform is basically 3 weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations probably around mid-year once we kind of finalize the impact the tax reform is going to have on BlackRock. And there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products."

Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the IRA channel. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're using technology to provide better services, alongside our humans, to connect with our financial advisers, both the traditional ones and the IRA ones. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisers today than we did a year ago with very little added in cost. And it -- so we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow up with human connectivity. So that probably the most -- the best example where we're bringing in more flows -- the other area where we're bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model-based products and customizing it. And in those cases, much of the product flow in these model-based products would be flowing into our iShares spaces. In terms of technology, overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin for Wealth Management. We see increased inquiry in the institutional side. As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration. And we would expect the continuation of the growth rates of 14-ish percent going forward in our technology platform. We're very encouraged. And we're very encouraged about bringing this all together, so it -- it's not one thing. It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor, these are all connecting and creating more dialogue, deeper penetration. So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper or consistent dialogue with more financial advisers. You mentioned Cachematrix. That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform. And that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017. And we expect a further -- furthering of opportunities in our cash management business."

And quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items. You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items of portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity. And now with all of the regulatory issues and where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space because it's obviously much, much cheaper. So it's really, quite frankly, very, very broad-based with the tail at the end of the year and start of the beginning of the year, coming more in fixed income than it is in equities and more in emerging markets because people are starting to allocate some of their monies outside of the U.S. for 2018.

So there are some clients that are looking to move that increased allocation to alternatives directly into the equity market for 2018, as they have become more bullish. And that's in light of all of the things that you know about, whether it be tax rates, earnings, global growth, et cetera, et cetera, that they may have, there may be able to have a bigger return in the outright equity market than they do in some of the more alternative spaces."

So yes, higher year-over-year G&A and, frankly, also sequential G&A was driven by a number of what we would consider manageable core decisions that were obviously very conscious, like technology, data, M&P, obviously, some occupancy as our headcount is growing. And the higher annual G&A expense, which is up about 12%, clearly reflected, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data. The annual, the year-over-year, the sequential, all 3, frankly, also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items. We try to highlight some of those. Professional fees were higher related to a bunch of things. We had M&A activity during the year. We had Brexit planning. We have MiFID II planning. We have a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX remeasurement expense. We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some of our prior deals. And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments. And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means that those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing better. That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last 5 years, and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale. We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time. I think the important thing for -- that we're trying to convey here is that you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base. And there's obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense. As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base. And you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline. And we don't think any of that will basically impact the -- in stable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin."

And the conversations that I have with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question. Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is not -- is underappreciated. And I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long-term investor because I think people are living longer or in the state of retirement longer. So the need to invest in longer duration in assets has never been greater. I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the 10, 30s or 40 basis points, obviously, that's an inflation reflection, too. But the demand for long-dated assets remains really strong. And look at that in credit spreads. And one of the examples why equity markets remain to be very robust. Worldwide, demand for long-dated financial assets remains to be strong. So one, it means continuation of -- and I think this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it, and we're seeing different -- we, in our LifePath products, we've extended the life of some of the -- LifePaths -- we've extended ownership of equities longer in some of our LifePath products. But like as I said, the demand from institutional client for long-dated assets remains to be quite robust. The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they are in the deaccumulation phase. What type of advice? How can individuals really have great financial literacy and financial assistance during the deaccumulation phase of retirement? I think this is one of the big issues of some of this anxiety that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. I also believe there are so many people in the world who are sitting at 50 years old that are unprepared because of the underinvestment in their retirement and the over-dependency of cash and bonds. It's how that's playing. We just finished a 2-day board meeting. We talked about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on. You brought up one important point that we are working on, and that is how do we transform retirement in the world. That is one of BlackRock's long-term strategies, and that intersects with technology, that intersects with our business in the United States, our business in Europe, our future business in China. So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around deaccumulation. And I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised. And hopefully, we can design products that meet those types of needs. I think, as an industry, we're not there yet. I would also say, in society, we're not there yet. There's not enough debate here in the United States. There's not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of deaccumulation."

And for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too high a cost. And as fees are coming down and if you don't have that -- those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind.

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results, while our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In addition, as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB's new revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. 
For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding gross up to expense and no material impact to as adjusted operating income or as-adjusted operating margin. 
In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recast quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. 
After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock's first quarter results, once again, demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's leading global investment and technology platform. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee Global Retail flows. 
First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70 was up 28% compared to the year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the debt refinancing. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that weren't divested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. 
First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. 
Sequentially, base fees were up 2% reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix resulted in 19% year-over-year growth and quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remains strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions, which contributed gains to both technology revenue and base fees. 
Today's growth as a result of the investments we've made over time, and we continue to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million, or 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. 
Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation, primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants. 
G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories, including costs associated with MiFID II but was also impacted by higher acquisition-related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX remeasurement expense versus a year ago. 
Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. 
Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail in both G&A and distribution and servicing costs, which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. 
Direct fund expense was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher-average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year ago quarter, which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continue to be margin aware and remain committed to optimizing our organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. 
As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies, including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. 
Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion driven by strong flows into core ETFs. 
During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares' ETFs, once again, offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. 
Retail net inflows of $17 billion represented 11% annualized organic growth, continue to trend positively and have now increased for five consecutive quarters. 
Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paced by $10 billion of closing for our top-performing active fixed income platform or 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets have top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period. 
Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. 
Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients de-risk, rebalance or sought liquidity in the current environment. Index flows of $10 billion driven by continued demand for LDI solutions more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation plan. 
Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by momentum and higher fee alternative products. 
Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternatives fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter. 
Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock's cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continue to invest in our cash business and lever scale for clients. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients' needs by optimizing investments and talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationship with a more diverse and global set of clients at any time in our history. 
Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here, in the United States, I believe, our position with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock's technology and risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform, position us to have a broader, a deeper, more robust conversations with our clients about their long term needs. 
Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced the spike in equity market volatility in February and March. Rising concerns over trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investments sentiments, causing many clients to pause or pullback as they become more uncertain about the future. 
In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as the spread between 10- and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points. 
Of a prospect of rising rates tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw our clients take advantage of in the first quarter. 
While global economic growth prospects and expectation for corporate earnings remains strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors, and we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalance and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. Even with these various crosscurrents, retail and institutional clients turn to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration, total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures. 
Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. Our long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment and technology platforms, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk-aware holistic portfolios that help clients achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio of construction technology to better operate under their own businesses. 
As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our Annual Report, this focus on clients' needs forms a foundation of our long-term strategy and we'll continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple, we will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth and client demand. And we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients. 
In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows, or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we, once again, captured the #1 share year-to-date, globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as the #1 share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. 
Demand is growing from clients who utilize ETS for efficient liquid market exposures through the secondary market. February volatile global equity market drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. 
During the week from February 5 through February 9 when the U.S. stock market has suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S. listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges with iShares trading a record $285 billion, yet creates and redeemed activity of iShares' funds over that same period of time was very low, at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefit of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in stressed markets. 
Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continue to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They're increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost efficient and high performing active. Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. 
For example, this quarter, we worked with our clients seeking in term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While the completed due diligence for the long term hedge fund allocation, we designed and optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge fund index while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking error. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio of construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our clients' needs. 
BlackRock's top-performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter, capturing client demand in a rising rate environment. Inflows were driven by a diverse ranges strategies including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. 
We're also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform is revitalized a year ago when we segmented our product offerings across the risk return and value spectrum, even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66 are fundamental active funds and 84% of our systematic active equity products were above benchmark or peer medians for the one year period. 
Illiquid alternatives also remain a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions -- diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. 
We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform and including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets. 
Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We've invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. 
Today, we manage nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion of net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry, and we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform. 
Last month, we crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environment that have impacted our clients' operations and increase their need for technology solutions to help management risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we've always focused on using technology to better understand risk in clients' portfolios. 
Aladdin risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted adviser of our clients during the financial crisis. 
And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients' business. 
The movement toward fee-based advice and wealth management globally has continued to be strong, even with some greater uncertainty here around the fiduciary rule in the U.S. We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio, not just products. We'll be more focused on risk management, and work most importantly, they will be more focused on a repeatable, scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched Advisor Center in the U.S, FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which help adviser construct better portfolios and scaling of their own businesses. 
Demand remains strong for institutional Aladdin business especially in Europe, where many of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw a 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double digit growth going forward. 
In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock lab for Artificial Intelligence in Palo Alto. This helps BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing to improve outcomes and to drive progress for investors, for our clients and for the overall firm. 
Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing, or ESG-related strategies. More and more clients not only in Europe, but increasingly in the United States are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance-related risk in the investments. From BlackRock's respective business relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company's long-term financial performance. For this reason, we're increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for our portfolio of construction and the stewardship process that we do. 
In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies, and we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand, last month, we appointed 3 new Directors with combined expertise and technology, financial services in fast-growing markets to join our Board of Directors. Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional and industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock. 
The value of BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholder is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It's our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve even as the markets our industry and even our firm experience is constant and sometimes, dramatic changes. 
Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for our next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. 
We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on clients' needs. We continue to invest in and execute on a strategy for long-term growth, leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So as we see cycles move towards active equities, when active equity managers can outperform the benchmark, including their fees, you will expect to see some flows out of the index product into the active equity products, and we should be the beneficiary of that. With that changes in the DoL rules, a lot of the financial advisers have been using index-like and ETF products to create model portfolios and build those model portfolios with the least expensive products. But as the cycle start to change, they will start to incorporate more active products in that both active fixed income and active equities.

But I would also say, there's confusion as you suggested in the U.S., but in the U.S. -- but in Europe, it's moved. Europe has definitely moved especially with MiFID II much more towards advise through a portfolio of solution. So I think this trend towards advise is global, is not slowing down. And I do believe and I reconfirm it, the secular growth in ETFs will continue to be very strong. We have said, and we have not changed our opinion over the next 3 to 5 years, ETFs will double in size."

So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility where we estimate there's over $50 trillion of cash that's sitting in bank accounts, earning less than 1%, some places, negative. So as rates go up, especially in the short end, that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets, of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products, which seem to be getting a lot of new flows from rises and rates."

I think we've tried to answer that question last quarter, we'll continue to try and answer it again. I think that we need to continually focus on looking at the entirety of our discretionary expense base.  There's definitely an interplay between our G&A line and compensation and as we continue to invest more across the platform, some of those items will hit the G&A line, like data, like technology, like occupancy, obviously, MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we're also, as we do that, we're able to change the composition of our employee base. So I think as we said before, as we would expect, G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we're also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a function of historical investment and scale on our business. So the results, when you look at the two of them, again, assuming that we've got fairly stable markets is continued upward bias in our margin. And we intend to continue playing offense in this environment. We went into 2018 planning to basically invest as much in the business as we have in years, and I think for the moment, really, nothing is changing our view there. That being said, I think we've tried to call out, and you'll see, obviously, on some of the disclosures there. I mean, most of that was basically in our Q, we're moving it up a little bit, we have added a few lines, we have been calling out what we call some more episodic, let's call it noncore G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot. We think hopefully with incremental disclosure, you'll have better insight as to what the recurring investment through that category is."

And it dovetails with the first area that we've built to assist portfolio managers, which is the BlackRock Investment Institute. And this was getting all of our portfolio things together with some of the best econometrics and people to talk about how we can structure portfolios better. Once we had that together, and that's a pretty significant group of people that meet 4x a year and produce weekly commentaries and this is really for internal use with the success of that, we wanted to take this further because we believe that utilizing artificial intelligence and people, so man and machine, is going to create a better result of man or machine. And so what we're doing is we're staffing up, and we hired of technology-oriented people, we've hired someone from NASA, we've hired someone from the technology area out west. And what we're doing is we're putting together a group to start to use the technology that we've already built to see how we can find some significance in that poor performance. So this is the beginning of what everyone has been writing about. It's more than just fintech. This is using data to try to pull it in first, which is not easy to do. You have to have the technology to pull in the data of which most data has only been around for the last 5 years, getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there's any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolio's performance. So this is a real important effort that's going on, and we're investing quite a lot into this, and it will dovetail into our investment institute, the internal research that we do, the portfolio of managers capability and eventually, all be able to be the throughput through Aladdin and our other technology."

As I've said in many quarterly updates, and I discussed that in my Chairman's letter that it is going to be released, I guess, Friday -- Monday, I hear Monday, I have it already. Technology continue to be one of our most important focuses as a firm, and this is a focus not just for the investment area, it's a focus across the entire firm. Clearly, using technology to give us better insights for investment performance escape, but we have historically have used technology to improve our operational scale. I think that's one of the reasons why our margins have improved over the last 5 years. We're using technology to enhance our connectivity with our clients in creating better distribution technology. And obviously, we've historically have used technology to enhance our risk analytics. So our scale and our global reach is allowing us to continue to invest and invest significantly for the future on behalf of our shareholders and our client, but there's I think our Palo Alto lab is just another step in this investment. The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is creating better operational efficiencies. So you've heard the question about how many people are going to be hiring, I don't know if that is -- that significant whether the number is because it is our expectation that these investments as they have in the past, is going to create more operational efficiencies over the long run. And I believe that's how we continue to drive our business, by driving -- by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we're investing more and more globally worldwide. So this is just a component. It's pretty special, as Rob suggested, and we believe we're going to get better, deeper insight on AI, specifically with its wide investment, but it is part of a whole strategy of investing, related with the technology."

And we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor-based products, including 108 of smart beta ETFs, which were the #1 player. iShares now has a global line up of 147 smart beta ETFs. So we've created that as we're seeing the demand. We did see factor-based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rate. So we believe the factor strategies are going to continue to grow, and we're investing in people and technology in the space. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages and factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership as we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979. We have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta, whether it be multi-factor, single factor, mid val to enhance the loan-only factors, which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities, I believe, that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor-aware model, the technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really helped our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk analysis for clients. And lastly, our people, which we've included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies growth, and they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now when it comes to ETFs and financial advisors, financial advisers are being asked to do more. It's not a stockpicking or bond picking environment. What they need to do is that they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have, they need help in modeling portfolios and a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial adviser where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have and the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs and not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient, and they can handle many, many more clients. So by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course, when you're modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisors, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest priced products that they could have, and that describes some of the movement between the alpha-seeking strategies and the passive ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So it all dovetails in. You have to have the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in and if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that, and that's been our mission. And I think that's what's driving more financial advisers who want to work with Aladdin because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve these desired results for the clients."

First of all, when we talk about these so-called committed but uninvested capital, there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline to that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly, is across-the-board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously, by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions-oriented firm, we actually have a fairly significant effort in tying together solutions of alternative which got another couple of billion of commitments that are outstanding. And secondly, that creates for us, because we call it committed capital and not net new business, it's because we don't turn fees on the committed capital, so with that committed capital basically gets into the ground, that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily, just because the performance fee lines gets a lot of attention now and then remember, we also don't account for our performance fees and illiquids the same way some of those pure plays do. We're basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned, and no longer subject to clawback, and we are not marketing to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings in that so you have an idea of what to build in bank there is.

With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock's first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology, what we provide to our clients are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We've continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop. And today, we are better positioned, we're having deeper dialogues, we're having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments, this is when BlackRock over 30 years have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over. We're back to a more volatile world, different inputs, different issues and this is where BlackRock is -- has historically have done quite well and I believe, we are well positioned for that. We're focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that and I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. 
So have a good quarter, and we will talk to everybody sometime in July."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release disclose",1411,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In addition, as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB's new revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. 
For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross-up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding gross-up to expense and no material impact to as-adjusted operating income or as-adjusted operating margin. In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recast quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. 
After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock's first quarter results once again demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's leading global investment and technology platform. 
The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee Global Retail flows. 
First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70 was up 28% compared to the year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the debt refinancing.  
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. 
First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%, reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies, including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix resulted in 19% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remains strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions, which contribute to gains in both technology revenue and base fees. Today's growth is a result of the investments we've made over time. And we continue to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million or 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation, primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants. 
G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories, including costs associated with MiFID II but was also impacted by higher acquisition-related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX remeasurement expense versus a year ago. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. 
Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail in both G&A and distribution and servicing costs, which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Direct fund expense was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continue to be margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies, including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. 
Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion, driven by strong flows into core ETFs. During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares' ETFs once again offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. 
Retail net inflows of $17 billion, representing 11% annualized organic growth, continued to trend positively and have now increased for 5 consecutive quarters. Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paced by $10 billion of flows into our top-performing active fixed income platform or 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets have top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period.
Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients derisked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. 
Index flows of $10 billion, driven by continued demand for LDI solutions, more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation planning. Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by momentum and higher fee alternative products.  
Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion, reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter. Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock's cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continued to invest in our cash business and levered scale for clients. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients' needs by optimizing investments in talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organ",1856,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationships with a more diverse and global set of clients than at any time in our history. 
Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here in the United States, I believe our position with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock's technology in risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform position us to have a broader, a deeper, more robust conversations with our clients about their long-term needs. 
Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record-high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced a spike in equity market volatility in February and March. Rising concerns over a trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investment sentiment, causing many clients to pause or pull back as they become more uncertain about the future. 
In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as the spread between 10- and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points. While the prospects of rising rates tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk-return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw clients take advantage of in the first quarter. 
While global economic growth prospects and expectations for corporate earnings remained strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors. And we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. 
Even with these various crosscurrents, retail and institutional clients turned to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration, total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures. Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. 
Our long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment and technology platform, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk-aware holistic portfolios that help clients achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio construction technology to better operate on their own businesses. 
As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our annual report, this focus on client needs forms a foundation of our long-term strategy. And we'll continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple. We will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth and client demand. And we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients. 
In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we once again captured the #1 share year-to-date globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as the #1 share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. 
Demand is growing from clients who utilize ETFs for efficient liquid market exposures through the secondary market. February volatile global equity market drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. During the week from February 5 through February 9, when the U.S. stock market had suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S.-listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges with iShares trading a record $285 billion. 
Yet creates and redeem activity of iShares' funds over that same period of time was very low at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefits of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in stressed markets. Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continue to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost-efficient and high-performing active. 
Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. For example, this quarter, we worked with a client seeking in-term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While they completed due diligence for their long-term hedge fund allocation, we designed and optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge fund index while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking error. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our clients' needs. 
BlackRock's top-performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter, capturing client demand in a rising rate environment. Inflows were driven by a diverse range of strategies, including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. We're also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform was revitalized a year ago, when we segmented our product offerings across the risk-return and value spectrum, even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66% of our fundamental active funds and 84% of our systematic active equity products were above benchmark or peer medians for the 1-year period. 
Illiquid alternatives also remained a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions -- diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform. And including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets. 
Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We have invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. Today, we manage nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion of net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry. And we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform. 
Last month, we crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environment that have impacted our clients' operations and increased their need for technology solutions to help manage risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have always focused on using technology to better understand risk in clients' portfolios. Aladdin Risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted adviser of our clients during the financial crisis. And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients' business. 
The movement towards fee-based advice in wealth management globally has continued to be strong, even with some greater uncertainty around the fiduciary rule in the U.S. We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio, not just products. They'll be more focused on risk management. And most importantly, they will be more focused on a repeatable, scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities, such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched Advisor Center in the U.S., FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which help advisers construct better portfolios and scaling of their own businesses. 
Demand remained strong for our institutional Aladdin business, especially in Europe, where many of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double-digit growth going forward. 
In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence in Palo Alto to advance how BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing, to improve outcomes and to drive progress for our investors, for our clients and for the overall firm. 
Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing or ESG-related strategies. More and more clients, not only in Europe but increasingly in the United States, are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance-related risk in their investments. From BlackRock's perspective, business-relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company's long-term financial performance. 
For this reason, we're increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for portfolio construction and the stewardship process that we do. In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies. And we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand, last month, we appointed 3 new directors with combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast-growing markets to join our Board of Directors. Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional and industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock. 
The value of BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholders is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It's our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve, even as the markets, our industry and even our firm experiences constant and sometimes dramatic changes. Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for our next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. 
We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on clients' needs. We continue to invest in and execute on a strategy for long-term growth, leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future. With that, let's open it up for questions."

But I would also say there is confusion, as you suggested, in the U.S. But in the U.S. -- but in Europe, it's moved. Europe has definitely moved, especially with MiFID II, much more towards advice through a portfolio solution. So I think this trend towards advice is global, is not slowing down. And I do believe, and I'll reconfirm it, the secular growth in ETFs will continue to be very strong. We have said, and we have not changed our opinion, over the next 3 to 5 years, ETFs will double in size."

We're one of the largest players in the fixed income space. And creating some more interest in higher rates is going to pull a significant amount of money out of cash into products that have been fairly stable for quite a long period of time. So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility, where we estimate there's over $50 trillion of cash that's sitting in bank accounts earning less than 1%, in some places, negative. So as rates go up, especially in the short end, that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets, of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products, which seem to be getting a lot of the new flows from rises in rates."

I think we tried to answer that question last quarter. We'll continue to try and answer it again. I think that we need to continually focus on looking at the entirety of our discretionary expense base. There's definitely an interplay between our G&A line and compensation. And as we continue to invest more across the platform, some of those items will hit the G&A line, like data, like technology, like occupancy. Obviously, MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we're also -- as we do that, we're able to change the composition of our employee base. So I think as we said before, as we would expect g&A expense to increase in stable markets, we're also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a function of historical investment and scale on our business. So the results, when you look at the two of them, again assuming that we've got a fairly stable market, is continued upward bias in our margin. And we intend to continue playing offense in this environment. We went into 2018 planning to basically invest as much in the business as we have in years. And I think for the moment, really nothing is changing our view there. That being said, I think we've tried to call out, and you'll see obviously on some of the disclosures there, I mean, most of that was basically in our Q. We're moving it up a little bit, but we have added a few lines. We have been calling out what we call some more episodic, let's call it, non-core G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot. And we think hopefully with the incremental disclosure, you'll have a better insight as to what the recurring investment through that category is."

And this was getting all of our portfolio teams together with some of the best econometrics and people to talk about how we can structure portfolios better. Once we had that together, and that's a pretty significant group of people that meet 4 times a year and produce weekly commentaries, and this is really for internal use, with the success of that, we wanted to take this further because we believe that utilizing artificial intelligence and people, so man and machine, is going to create a better result of man or machine. And so what we're doing is we're staffing up. And we hired a number of technology-oriented people. We've hired someone from NASA. We've hired someone from the technology area out West. And what we're doing is we're putting together a group to start to use the technology that we have already built to see how we can find some significance in that for our performance. So this is the beginning of what everyone has been writing about. It's more than just fintech. This is using data to try to pull it in first, which is not easy to do. You have to have the technology to pull in the data of which most data has only been around for the last 5 years. Getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there's any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolio's performance. So this is a real important effort that's going on. And we're investing quite a lot into this. And it will dovetail into our Investment Institute, the internal research that we do, the portfolio managers' capability and eventually all be able to be the throughput through Aladdin and our other technology."

As I've said in many quarterly updates, and I discussed that in my Chairman's letter that it is going to be released, I guess, Friday -- Monday, I hear Monday. I have it already. Technology continues to be one of our most important focuses as a firm. And this is a focus not just for the investment area, it's a focus across the entire firm. Clearly, using technology to give us better insights for investment performance is key. But we have historically have used technology to improve our operational scale. I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have improved over the last 5 years. We're using technology to enhance our connectivity with our clients in creating better distribution technology. And obviously, we historically have used technology to enhance our risk analytics. So our scale and our global reach is allowing us to continue to invest and invest significantly for the future on behalf of our shareholders and our clients. But there is -- I think our Palo Alto lab is just another step in this investment. The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is creating better operational efficiencies. So you've raised the question about how many people we're going to be hiring. I don't know if that is that significant, whether the number is, because it is our expectation that these investments, as they have in the past, is going to create more operational efficiencies over the long run. And I believe that's how we continue to drive our business, by driving -- by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we are investing more and more globally worldwide. So this is just a component. It's pretty special, as Rob suggested. And we believe we're going to get better, deeper insight on AI, specifically with this one investment. But it is part of a whole strategy of investing related to the technology."

And we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor-based products, including 108 of smart beta ETFs, which we're the #1 player. iShares now has a global lineup of 147 smart beta ETFs. So we've created that as we're seeing the demand. We did see factor-based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rate. So we believe the factor strategies are going to continue to grow. And we're investing in people and technology in the space. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages and factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership as we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979. We have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta, whether it be multifactor, single factor, min vol to enhance to long-only factors, which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities, I believe, that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor-aware model. The technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really help our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk analysis for clients. And lastly, our people, which we have included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies group. And they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now when it comes to ETFs and financial advisers, financial advisers are being asked to do more. It's not a stock-picking or a bond-picking environment. What they need to do is they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have. They need help in modeling portfolios. And a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial adviser, where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have and the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs. And not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient and they can handle many, many more clients. So by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course, when you're modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisers, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest-priced products that they could have. And that describes some of the movement between the alpha-seeking strategies and the passive and ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So it all dovetails in. You have to have the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in. And if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that. And that's been our mission. And I think that's what's driving more financial advisers to want to work with BlackRock because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve the desired results for their client."

First of all, when we talk about the so-called committed but uninvested capital, there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline to that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly is across the board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously, by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions-oriented firm, we actually have a fairly significant effort in tying together solutions of alternatives, which has got another couple billion of commitments that are outstanding. Secondly -- and that creates, as you know, for us because we call it committed capital and not net new business is because we don't earn fees on the committed capital. As that committed capital basically gets put into the ground, that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily, just because the performance fee line gets a lot of attention now -- and then remember, we also don't account for our performance fees in illiquids the same way as some of those pure plays do. We're basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned and no longer subject to clawback. And we are not marking to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings on that. So you have an idea of what to build in bank there is.

With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning, and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock's first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology, what we provide to our clients as they are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We have continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop. And today, we are better positioned, we're having deeper dialogues, we're having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments, this is when BlackRock, over our 30 years, have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over. We're back to a more volatile world, different inputs, different issues. And this is where BlackRock has historically have done quite well. And I believe we are well positioned for that. We're focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that. And I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. 
So have a good quarter, and we will talk to everybody sometime in July."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release disclose",1411,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In addition, as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB's new revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. 
For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross-up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding gross-up to expense and no material impact to as-adjusted operating income or as-adjusted operating margin. In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recast quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. 
After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock's first quarter results once again demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's leading global investment and technology platform. 
The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee Global Retail flows. 
First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70 was up 28% compared to the year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the debt refinancing.  
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. 
First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%, reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies, including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix, resulted in 19% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remains strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions, which contribute to gains in both technology revenue and base fees. Today's growth is a result of the investments we've made over time. And we continue to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million or 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation, primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants. 
G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories, including costs associated with MiFID II but was also impacted by higher acquisition-related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX remeasurement expense versus a year ago. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. 
Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail on both G&A and distribution and servicing costs, which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Direct fund expense was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continue to be margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies, including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. 
Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion, driven by strong flows into core ETFs. During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares' ETFs once again offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. 
Retail net inflows of $17 billion, representing 11% annualized organic growth, continued to trend positively and have now increased for 5 consecutive quarters. Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paced by $10 billion of flows into our top-performing active fixed income platform, where 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets have top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period.
Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities, while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients derisked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. 
Index flows of $10 billion, driven by continued demand for LDI solutions, more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation planning. Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by momentum and higher fee alternative products.  
Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion, reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter. Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock's cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continued to invest in our cash business and levered scale for clients. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients' needs by optimizing investments in talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organ",1856,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationships with a more diverse and global set of clients than at any time in our history. 
Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here in the United States, I believe our position with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock's technology in risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform position us to have a broader, a deeper, more robust conversations with our clients about their long-term needs. 
Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record-high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced a spike in equity market volatility in February and March. Rising concerns over a trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investment sentiment, causing many clients to pause or pull back as they become more uncertain about the future. 
In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as the spread between 10- and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points. While the prospects of rising rates tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk-return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw clients take advantage of in the first quarter. 
While global economic growth prospects and expectations for corporate earnings remained strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors. And we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. 
Even with these various crosscurrents, retail and institutional clients turned to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration, total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures. Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. 
Our long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment and technology platform, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk-aware holistic portfolios that help clients achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio construction technology to better operate on their own businesses. 
As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our annual report, this focus on client needs forms the foundation of our long-term strategy. And we'll continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple. We will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth and client demand. And we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients. 
In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we once again captured the #1 share year-to-date globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as the #1 share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. 
Demand is growing from clients who utilize ETFs for efficient liquid market exposures through the secondary market. February volatile global equity market drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. During the week from February 5 through February 9, when the U.S. stock market had suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S.-listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges with iShares trading a record $285 billion. 
Yet creates and redeem activity of iShares' funds over that same period of time was very low at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefits of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in stressed markets. Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continue to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost-efficient and high-performing active. 
Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. For example, this quarter, we worked with a client seeking in-term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While they completed due diligence for their long-term hedge fund allocation, we designed and optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge fund's index while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking error. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our clients' needs. 
BlackRock's top-performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter, capturing client demand in a rising rate environment. Inflows were driven by a diverse range of strategies, including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. We're also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform was revitalized a year ago, when we segmented our product offerings across the risk-return and value spectrum, even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66% of our fundamental active funds and 84% of our systematic active equity products were above benchmark or peer medians for the 1-year period. 
Illiquid alternatives also remained a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions -- diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter, for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform. And including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets. 
Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We have invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. Today, we manage nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion of net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry. And we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform. 
Last month, we crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environment that have impacted our clients' operations and increased their need for technology solutions to help manage risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have always focused on using technology to better understand risk in clients' portfolios. Aladdin Risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted adviser of our clients during the financial crisis. And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients' business. 
The movement towards fee-based advice in wealth management globally has continued to be strong, even with some greater uncertainty around the fiduciary rule in the U.S. We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio, not just products. They'll be more focused on risk management. And most importantly, they will be more focused on a repeatable, scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities, such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched Advisor Center in the U.S., FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which help advisers construct better portfolios and scaling of their own businesses. 
Demand remained strong for our institutional Aladdin business, especially in Europe, where many of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double-digit growth going forward. 
In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence in Palo Alto to advance how BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing, to improve outcomes and to drive progress for our investors, for our clients and for the overall firm. 
Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing, or ESG-related strategies. More and more clients, not only in Europe but increasingly in the United States, are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance-related risk in their investments. From BlackRock's perspective, business-relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company's long-term financial performance. 
For this reason, we're increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for portfolio construction and the stewardship process that we do. In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies. And we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand, last month we appointed 3 new directors with combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast-growing markets to join our Board of Directors. Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional and industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock. 
The value of BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholders is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It's our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve, even as the markets, our industry and even our firm experiences constant and sometimes dramatic changes. Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for our next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe, because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. 
We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on clients' needs. We continue to invest in and execute on a strategy for long-term growth, leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future. With that, let's open it up for questions."

So as we see cycles move towards active equities, when active equity managers can outperform the benchmark, including their fees, you will expect to see some flows out of the index product into the active equity product. And we should be the beneficiary of that. With the changes in the DOL rules, a lot of the financial advisers have been using index-like and ETF products to create model portfolios and build those model portfolios with the least expensive products. But as the cycles start to change, they will start to incorporate more active products in that both active fixed income and active equities.

So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility, where we estimate there's over $50 trillion of cash that's sitting in bank accounts earning less than 1%, in some places, negative. So as rates go up, especially in the short end, that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets, of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products, which seem to be getting a lot of the new flows from rises in rates."

I think we tried to answer that question last quarter. We'll continue to try and answer it again. I think that we need to continually focus on looking at the entirety of our discretionary expense base. There's definitely an interplay between our G&A line and compensation. And as we continue to invest more across the platform, some of those items will hit the G&A line, like data, like technology, like occupancy. Obviously, MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we're also -- as we do that, we're able to change the composition of our employee base. So I think as we said before, as we would expect g&A expense to increase in stable markets, we're also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a function of historical investment and scale on our business. So the results, when you look at the two of them, again assuming that we've got a fairly stable market, is continued upward bias in our margin.

We're moving it up a little bit, but we have added a few lines. We have been calling out what we call some more episodic, let's call it, non-core G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot. And we think hopefully with the incremental disclosure, you'll have a better insight as to what the recurring investment through that category is."

And it dovetails with the first area that we've built to assist portfolio managers, which is the BlackRock Investment Institute. And this was getting all of our portfolio teams together with some of the best econometrics and people to talk about how we can structure portfolios better. Once we had that together, and that's a pretty significant group of people that meet 4 times a year and produce weekly commentaries, and this is really for internal use, with the success of that, we wanted to take this further because we believe that utilizing artificial intelligence and people, so man and machine, is going to create a better result of man or machine. And so what we're doing is we're staffing up. And we hired a number of technology-oriented people. We've hired someone from NASA. We've hired someone from the technology area out West. And what we're doing is we're putting together a group to start to use the technology that we have already built to see how we can find some significance in that for our performance. So this is the beginning of what everyone has been writing about. It's more than just fintech. This is using data to try to pull it in first, which is not easy to do. You have to have the technology to pull in the data of which most data has only been around for the last 5 years. Getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there's any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolio's performance. So this is a real important effort that's going on. And we're investing quite a lot into this. And it will dovetail into our Investment Institute, the internal research that we do, the portfolio managers' capability and eventually all be able to be the throughput through Aladdin and our other technology."

As I've said in many quarterly updates, and I discussed that in my Chairman's letter that it is going to be released, I guess, Friday -- Monday, I hear Monday. I have it already. Technology continues to be one of our most important focuses as a firm. And this is a focus not just for the investment area, it's a focus across the entire firm. Clearly, using technology to give us better insights for investment performance is key. But we have historically have used technology to improve our operational scale. I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have improved over the last 5 years. We're using technology to enhance our connectivity with our clients in creating better distribution technology. And obviously, we historically have used technology to enhance our risk analytics. So our scale and our global reach is allowing us to continue to invest and invest significantly for the future on behalf of our shareholders and our clients. But there is -- I think our Palo Alto lab is just another step in this investment. The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is creating better operational efficiencies. So you've raised the question about how many people we're going to be hiring. I don't know if that is that significant, whether the number is, because it is our expectation that these investments, as they have in the past, is going to create more operational efficiencies over the long run. And I believe that's how we continue to drive our business, by driving -- by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we are investing more and more globally worldwide. So this is just a component. It's pretty special, as Rob suggested. And we believe we're going to get better, deeper insight on AI, specifically with this one investment. But it is part of a whole strategy of investing related to the technology."

And we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor-based products, including 108 of smart beta ETFs, which we're the #1 player. iShares now has a global lineup of 147 smart beta ETFs. So we've created that as we're seeing the demand. We did see factor-based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rate. So we believe the factor strategies are going to continue to grow. And we're investing in people and technology in this space. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages and factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership as we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979. We have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta, whether it be multifactor, single factor, min vol to enhance to long-only factors, which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities, I believe, that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor-aware model. The technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really help our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk analysis for clients. And lastly, our people, which we have included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies group. And they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now when it comes to ETFs and financial advisers, financial advisers are being asked to do more. It's not a stock-picking or a bond-picking environment. What they need to do is they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have. They need help in modeling portfolios. And a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial adviser, where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have and the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs. And not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient and they can handle many, many more clients. So by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course, when you're modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisers, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest-priced products that they could have. And that describes some of the movement between the alpha-seeking strategies and the passive and ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So it all dovetails in. You have to have the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in. And if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that. And that's been our mission. And I think that's what's driving more financial advisers to want to work with BlackRock because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve the desired results for their client."

First of all, when we talk about the so-called committed but uninvested capital, there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline to that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly is across the board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously, by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions-oriented firm, we actually have a fairly significant effort in tying together solutions of alternatives, which has got another couple billion of commitments that are outstanding. Secondly -- and that creates, as you know, for us because we call it committed capital and not net new business, it's because we don't earn fees on the committed capital. So as that committed capital basically gets put into the ground, that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily, just because the performance fee line gets a lot of attention now -- and then remember, we also don't account for our performance fees in illiquids the same way as some of those pure plays do. We're basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned and no longer subject to clawback. And we are not marking to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings on that. So you have an idea of what to build in bank there is. But I think as we think about it, we're very bullish on the future growth prospects of that sector."

With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning, and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock's first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology, what we provide to our clients as they are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We have continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop. And today, we are better positioned, we're having deeper dialogues, we're having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments, this is when BlackRock, over our 30 years, have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over. We're back to a more volatile world, different inputs, different issues. And this is where BlackRock has historically have done quite well. And I believe we are well positioned for that. We're focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that. And I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. 
So have a good quarter, and we will talk to everybody sometime in July."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release disclose",1411,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In addition, as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB's new revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. 
For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross-up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding gross-up to expense and no material impact to as-adjusted operating income or as-adjusted operating margin. In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recast quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. 
After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock's first quarter results once again demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's leading global investment and technology platform. 
The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee Global Retail flows. 
First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70 was up 28% compared to the year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the debt refinancing.  
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. 
First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%, reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies, including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix, resulted in 19% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remains strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions, which contribute to gains in both technology revenue and base fees. Today's growth is a result of the investments we've made over time. And we continue to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million or 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation, primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants. 
G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories, including costs associated with MiFID II but was also impacted by higher acquisition-related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX remeasurement expense versus a year ago. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. 
Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail on both G&A and distribution and servicing costs, which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Direct fund expense was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continue to be margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies, including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. 
Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion, driven by strong flows into core ETFs. During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares' ETFs once again offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. 
Retail net inflows of $17 billion, representing 11% annualized organic growth, continued to trend positively and have now increased for 5 consecutive quarters. Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paced by $10 billion of flows into our top-performing active fixed income platform, where 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets have top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period.
Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities, while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients derisked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. 
Index flows of $10 billion, driven by continued demand for LDI solutions, more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation planning. Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by momentum and higher fee alternative products.  
Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion, reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter. Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock's cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continued to invest in our cash business and levered scale for clients. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients' needs by optimizing investments in talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organ",1856,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationships with a more diverse and global set of clients than at any time in our history. 
Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here in the United States, I believe our position with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock's technology in risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform position us to have a broader, a deeper, more robust conversations with our clients about their long-term needs. 
Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record-high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced a spike in equity market volatility in February and March. Rising concerns over a trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investment sentiment, causing many clients to pause or pull back as they become more uncertain about the future. 
In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as the spread between 10- and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points. While the prospects of rising rates tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk-return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw clients take advantage of in the first quarter. 
While global economic growth prospects and expectations for corporate earnings remained strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors. And we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. 
Even with these various crosscurrents, retail and institutional clients turned to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration, total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures. Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. 
Our long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment and technology platform, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk-aware holistic portfolios that help clients achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio construction technology to better operate on their own businesses. 
As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our annual report, this focus on client needs forms the foundation of our long-term strategy. And we'll continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple. We will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth and client demand. And we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients. 
In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we once again captured the #1 share year-to-date globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as the #1 share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. 
Demand is growing from clients who utilize ETFs for efficient liquid market exposures through the secondary market. February volatile global equity market drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. During the week from February 5 through February 9, when the U.S. stock market had suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S.-listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges with iShares trading a record $285 billion. 
Yet creates and redeem activity of iShares' funds over that same period of time was very low at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefits of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in stressed markets. Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continue to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost-efficient and high-performing active. 
Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. For example, this quarter, we worked with a client seeking in-term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While they completed due diligence for their long-term hedge fund allocation, we designed and optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge fund's index while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking error. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our clients' needs. 
BlackRock's top-performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter, capturing client demand in a rising rate environment. Inflows were driven by a diverse range of strategies, including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. We're also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform was revitalized a year ago, when we segmented our product offerings across the risk-return and value spectrum, even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66% of our fundamental active funds and 84% of our systematic active equity products were above benchmark or peer medians for the 1-year period. 
Illiquid alternatives also remained a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions -- diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter, for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform. And including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets. 
Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We have invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. Today, we manage nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion of net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry. And we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform. 
Last month, we crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environment that have impacted our clients' operations and increased their need for technology solutions to help manage risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have always focused on using technology to better understand risk in clients' portfolios. Aladdin Risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted adviser of our clients during the financial crisis. And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients' business. 
The movement towards fee-based advice in wealth management globally has continued to be strong, even with some greater uncertainty around the fiduciary rule in the U.S. We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio, not just products. They'll be more focused on risk management. And most importantly, they will be more focused on a repeatable, scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities, such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched Advisor Center in the U.S., FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which help advisers construct better portfolios and scaling of their own businesses. 
Demand remained strong for our institutional Aladdin business, especially in Europe, where many of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double-digit growth going forward. 
In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence in Palo Alto to advance how BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing, to improve outcomes and to drive progress for our investors, for our clients and for the overall firm. 
Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing, or ESG-related strategies. More and more clients, not only in Europe but increasingly in the United States, are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance-related risk in their investments. From BlackRock's perspective, business-relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company's long-term financial performance. 
For this reason, we're increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for portfolio construction and the stewardship process that we do. In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies. And we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand, last month we appointed 3 new directors with combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast-growing markets to join our Board of Directors. Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional and industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock. 
The value of BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholders is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It's our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve, even as the markets, our industry and even our firm experiences constant and sometimes dramatic changes. Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for our next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe, because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. 
We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on clients' needs. We continue to invest in and execute on a strategy for long-term growth, leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future. With that, let's open it up for questions."

But today, we're in a much better position because we have performance and our products are priced properly to be the best value in their class. So as we see cycles move towards active equities, when active equity managers can outperform the benchmark, including their fees, you will expect to see some flows out of the index product into the active equity product. And we should be the beneficiary of that. With the changes in the DOL rules, a lot of the financial advisers have been using index-like and ETF products to create model portfolios and build those model portfolios with the least expensive products. But as the cycles start to change, they will start to incorporate more active products in that both active fixed income and active equities.

Europe has definitely moved, especially with MiFID II, much more towards advice through a portfolio solution. So I think this trend towards advice is global, is not slowing down.

We're one of the largest players in the fixed income space. And creating some more interest in higher rates is going to pull a significant amount of money out of cash into products that have been fairly stable for quite a long period of time. So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility, where we estimate there's over $50 trillion of cash that's sitting in bank accounts earning less than 1%, in some places, negative. So as rates go up, especially in the short end, that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets, of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products, which seem to be getting a lot of the new flows from rises in rates."

And as we continue to invest more across the platform, some of those items will hit the G&A line, like data, like technology, like occupancy. Obviously, MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we're also -- as we do that, we're able to change the composition of our employee base. So I think as we said before, as we would expect G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we're also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a function of historical investment and scale on our business. So the results, when you look at the two of them, again assuming that we've got a fairly stable market, is continued upward bias in our margin. And we intend to continue playing offense in this environment. We went into 2018 planning to basically invest as much in the business as we have in years. And I think for the moment, really nothing is changing our view there. That being said, I think we've tried to call out, and you'll see obviously on some of the disclosures there, I mean, most of that was basically in our Q. We're moving it up a little bit, but we have added a few lines. We have been calling out what we call some more episodic, let's call it, non-core G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot.

Getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there's any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolio's performance.

The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is creating better operational efficiencies.

I don't know if that is that significant, whether the number is, because it is our expectation that these investments, as they have in the past, is going to create more operational efficiencies over the long run. And I believe that's how we continue to drive our business, by driving -- by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we are investing more and more globally worldwide.

At the end of the first quarter, we man",638,"So working backwards, we're seeing a huge demand for smart beta product. And you know that in 2017, we saw about 15% organic growth in smart beta. And we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor-based products, including 108 of smart beta ETFs, which we're the #1 player. iShares now has a global lineup of 147 smart beta ETFs. So we've created that as we're seeing the demand. We did see factor-based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rate. So we believe the factor strategies are going to continue to grow. And we're investing in people and technology in this space. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages and factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership as we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979. We have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta, whether it be multifactor, single factor, min vol to enhance to long-only factors, which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities, I believe, that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor-aware model. The technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really help our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk analysis for clients. And lastly, our people, which we have included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies group. And they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now when it comes to ETFs and financial advisers, financial advisers are being asked to do more. It's not a stock-picking or a bond-picking environment. What they need to do is they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have. They need help in modeling portfolios. And a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial adviser, where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have and the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs. And not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient and they can handle many, many more clients. So by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course, when you're modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisers, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest-priced products that they could have. And that describes some of the movement between the alpha-seeking strategies and the passive and ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So it all dovetails in. You have to have the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in. And if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that. And that's been our mission. And I think that's what's driving more financial advisers to want to work with BlackRock because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve the desired results for their client."

I would also though suggest, I think we're in a very good position in our liquid alts area, too. So we look at this as an important growth area for the firm.

First of all, when we talk about the so-called committed but uninvested capital, there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline to that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly is across the board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously, by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions-oriented firm, we actually have a fairly significant effort in tying together solutions of alternatives, which has got another couple billion of commitments that are outstanding. Secondly -- and that creates, as you know, for us because we call it committed capital and not net new business, it's because we don't earn fees on the committed capital. So as that committed capital basically gets put into the ground, that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily, just because the performance fee line gets a lot of attention now -- and then remember, we also don't account for our performance fees in illiquids the same way as some of those pure plays do. We're basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned and no longer subject to clawback. And we are not marking to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings on that. So you have an idea of what to build in bank there is. But I think as we think about it, we're very bullish on the future growth prospects of that sector."

With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning, and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock's first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology, what we provide to our clients as they are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We have continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop. And today, we are better positioned, we're having deeper dialogues, we're having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments, this is when BlackRock, over our 30 years, have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over. We're back to a more volatile world, different inputs, different issues. And this is where BlackRock has historically have done quite well. And I believe we are well positioned for that. We're focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that. And I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. 
So have a good quarter, and we will talk to everybody sometime in July."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
After a strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future. 
Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach, position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before, and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history. Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to, and continually invest in, our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well positioned to serve clients in any market environment. 
BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash, evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha-seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth. 
Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter. Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance in loan only equity funds and our broad-based the direct and solutions-oriented hedge fund platform. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. Overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Adviser and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for Financial Markets Advisory services. 
Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount, and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. 
G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware especially in the current environment but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at Investor Day, we expect to see board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. 
Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher-fee noncore iShares have slowed during the year as market uncertainty has impacted investors' tactical risk allocation decisions. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources. 
Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products. 
Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant de-risking activity in passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion led by continued demand for our target data offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions. 
Illiquid alternative fund raising momentum continued, with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tannenbaum Capital Partners scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading global credit capital asset manager and advancing our goal with providing clients with a diverse range of alternative investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock's cash management business had net inflows of $6 billion as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance. 
We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remain intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth. Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest-growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter as clients recalibrated their risk. Pol",1762,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter as clients recalibrated their risk. Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing heads in Italy and Mexico and further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors' confidence. Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth unfortunately are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trade that have been, for years, supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking. Over time, the supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets, but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past. If you strip out a handful of outperforming tax docs, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short-term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years. These rising rates and the flattening curve have made cash not a safe place but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. While investors' caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. 
Revenues increased 11%. Operating income increased 16% and our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year. We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across actives, index and cash in the second quarter. We have seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they are reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues of the clients today have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. 
The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients. We remain focused on investing in BlackRock's future, to stay ahead of our clients' needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders. 
As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainty, activity has been elevated year-to-date with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work and net flows have been more muted as a result. 
Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S.-based clients sought liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource their investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally. We're also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions as a combination of rising rates and resilient equity market levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. 
Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation and the customized target data capabilities. LifePath, our target data service series, has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth. This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors' portfolio has drove $18 billion of net inflows into iShares and BlackRock once again captured the #1 share of global ETF flows year-to-date because buy and hold clients are positioning our portfolio for the long term, they tend to be less sensitive to inter-quarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs. 
We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs and we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 trillion and $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023. 
Growth will be driven by core and noncore products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps both in equities and fixed income exposures. And wealth clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems. Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses and the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisers is becoming more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients. 
Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and whole portfolio solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisers who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds. 
Inflows were driven by our strong demand in our top-performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion in net flows, each in our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well positioned for a rising rate environment. 
We achieved the #1 position, gathering active fixed income flow for the quarter in the United States wealth space, where we're delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets in our top-performing and lowest-priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics and scenario-testing tools across a diverse offering of products from short duration to unconstrained. 
Performance across fixed-income strategies remained strong. At the end of the quarter, 78% of our taxable fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for a 1-year period. Our Active Equity's 59% of our fundamental and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for a 1-year period. Strong performance is the foundation of delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows. 
In alternatives, we're seeing more momentum in fundraising than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform, supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and skill distribution. We're beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit, which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space. We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe. We also announced the first flows of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first flows reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. 
And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy where we're seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals. 
Cash management is another area where we are gaining share and we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. With cash strategies earning between approximately 2% and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade, clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset, but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows and cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock's diverse business model. Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. 
Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation and evolving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools like institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix. For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution to compliance to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who services those assets through Provider Aladdin, as well as for wealth managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad wealth management community. Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity. 
Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid-teens range going forward. We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer-term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate. 
I want to end by saying we've seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause, but we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them. With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so if anything, we are seeing greater demand for these types of products because it simplifies the process. It creates a better environment for investing, a better environment for compliance and compliance review. And importantly, it allows the advisers and the firm to better understand all of their clients' risk in comparing the risk associated with all the portfolios, in making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's clients' portfolios.

In addition, strong flows into MAI or multi-asset income fund and factor-based strategies of about $1 billion each. That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think as we've mentioned before, that is relevant, not that it relates necessarily to the flow itself. But we do note that, obviously, global all has a higher fee than LifePath does, and that, obviously, creates some drag on the fee rate and overall revenue growth.

So it's probably seeing more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform? Does it create more uncertainties? But if it doesn't, yes, we don't have an all outright tariff war that's increased from this point now. I would say, equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January. We've had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock repurchases. So the amount of underlying equity has shrunk. And PEs have reduced. Now PEs have reduced the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So if there is more positive clarification that doesn't lead to tariff wars, then the market would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there's a tariff war, some of it's priced into the market. Some of it's not. But I would say, Michael, that there's some asymmetry here. I think there's probably a little more upside right now than downside. But let's be clear. If the trade ware leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year. So the market is trying to digest all this as we speak. So I'm pretty calm about it. The one thing I will say this, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty. And the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We're having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on really looking at their risks on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios. And probably the most important thing I could say is more and more clients are coming to BlackRock."

We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We're, obviously, trying to be more thoughtful as to spending in the places we get the greatest impact in the current market. So there's obviously always reallocation and rethinking as to what we want to do with that spend. But I think there's no question that our heads are up, our eyes are forward, and we're continuing to play offense in the market and continuing to invest in all of the strategic initiatives that we've talked at length with you about and discussed again at Investor Day. So illiquids, factors, portfolio construction, technology across the board, as Larry said, in terms of alpha generation, digital distribution are on operating platform. Continuing to think smartly about investing in regions especially in the current environment were maybe even more important than ever to be local in key markets. And so I think that's exactly right. On the other hand, again, as I echoed, when we talked about our technology growth from a year-over-year perspective, quarterly margins are, obviously, we are -- even in positive markets, we would basically ask you to look at the trends overall. I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think looking at longer term trends is much more indicative of more operating leverage the necessarily on a  quarter-to-quarter basis."

So obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty and flows, when we look at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in organic base fee growth for the quarter. I would say that, that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift in sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income, though there was a shift to shorter-duration fixed income and that does come with a bit of a lower fee more broadly. If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares but less momentum in higher fee noncore exposures versus what we've seen historically and, in particular, outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities. On a base fee growth, we think about those growth plans, clearly are relatively higher fee than the quarter. I think we additionally, saw some slower Active Equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which, frankly, is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we've mentioned in the past in our discussions divergent data and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
After a strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future. 
Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach, position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before, and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history. Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to, and continually invest in, our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well positioned to serve clients in any market environment. 
BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash, evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities, including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha-seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth. 
Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.
Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat, despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter. 
Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance in long-only equity funds and our broad-based direct and solutions-oriented hedge fund platform. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. 
Overall demand remained strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Adviser and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for Financial Markets Advisory services. 
Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast, even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. 
Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at investor day, we expect to see board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. 
Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as on our cash management business. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher-fee noncore iShares have slowed during the year, as market uncertainty has impacted investors' tactical risk allocation decisions. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources. 
Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter, as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products. 
Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant de-risking activity in the passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion led by continued demand for our target data offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions. 
Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading global credit asset manager and advancing our goal of providing clients with a diverse range of alternative investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry, driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock's cash management business saw a net inflows of $6 billion, as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance. 
We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remained intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth. Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest-growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Po",1768,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing heads in Italy and Mexico. And further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors' confidence. 
Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested, as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth, unfortunately, are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trade that have been, for years, supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking. Over time, the supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets, but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past. If you strip out a handful of outperforming tax docs, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. 
We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty, and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short-term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years. These rising rates and a flattening curve have made cash not a safe place, but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. 
While investors' caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. Revenues increased 11%. Operating income increased 16%. And our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year. We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across active, index and cash in the second quarter. 
We had seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they are reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues of the clients today have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. 
The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients. 
We remain focused on investing in BlackRock's future to stay ahead of our clients' needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders. 
As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainty, activity has been elevated year-to-date, with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work, and net flows have been more muted as a result. 
Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S.-based clients sought liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource their investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally. 
We are also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions, as a combination of rising rates and resilient equity market levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. 
Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation and the customized target date capabilities. LifePath, our target date service -- series has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth. 
This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors' portfolio has drove $18 billion of net inflows into iShares. And BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows year-to-date. Because buy-and-hold clients are positioning their portfolio for the long term, they tend to be less sensitive to inter-quarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs. 
We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs. And we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 trillion and $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023. Growth will be driven by core and noncore products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps, both in equities and fixed income exposures. And wealth clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems. Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses. And the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisers is becoming more and more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients. 
Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and whole portfolio of solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisers who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds. 
Inflows were driven by our strong demand in our top-performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion in net flows, each in our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well positioned for a rising rate environment. 
We achieved the #1 position, gathering active fixed income flow for the quarter in the United States wealth space, where we are delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets are top performing and lowest-priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics and scenario-testing tools across a diverse offering of products from short duration to unconstrained. 
Performance across fixed income strategies remained strong. At the end of the quarter, 78% of our taxable fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for a 1-year period. Our Active Equity is 59% of our fundamental, and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for a 1-year period. 
Strong performance is the foundation of delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows. 
In alternatives, we're seeing more momentum in fundraising than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform, supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and skill distribution. We're beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit, which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space. We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe. 
We also announced the first flows of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first close reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. 
And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy. We are seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals. 
Cash management is another area where we are gaining share, and we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. With cash strategies earning between approximately 2% and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade, clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset, but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. 
BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows and cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock's diverse business model. 
Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation and evolving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix. 
For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution, to compliance, to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who services those assets through Provider Aladdin as well as for wealth managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad wealth management community. Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity.
Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid-teens range going forward. 
We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer-term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate. 
I want to end by saying we've seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause, but we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

They're looking for better tools to navigate their clients' money with better consistency. They're using, as Rob said, more models. And having Aladdin for Wealth allows them to navigate this.

It creates a better environment for investing, a better environment for compliance and compliance review. And importantly, it has -- it allows the advisers and the firm to better understand all of their clients' risk in comparing the risk associated with all the portfolios, in making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's clients' portfolios. This plays into our strength. This gives us a great opportunity to be more connected with our distribution partner.

But the multi-asset line item did see $8 billion of flows in the quarter, as you mentioned, continued demand for target date offerings, including one significant custom-targeted solution for a large client. In addition, strong flows into MAI, or multi-asset income, fund and factor-based strategies of about $1 billion each. That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think, as we've mentioned before, that is relevant, not as it relates necessarily to the flow itself. But we do note that, obviously, global has a higher fee than LifePath does. And that, obviously, creates some drag on the fee rate and overall revenue growth.

So it's probably seeing more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform? Does it create more uncertainties? But if it doesn't and we don't have an all outright tariff war that's increased from this point now, I would say, equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January. We've had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock repurchases. So the amount of underlying equity has shrunk. And PEs have reduced. Now PEs are reduced from the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So if there is more positive clarification that doesn't lead to tariff wars, then the markets would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there's a tariff war, some of it's priced into the market. Some of it's not. But I would say, Michael, that there's some asymmetry here. I think there's probably a little more upside right now than downside that -- but let's be clear. If the trade war leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year, so the market is trying to digest all this, as we speak. So I'm pretty calm about it. The one thing I will say this, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty. And the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We're having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on really looking at their risks, on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios. And probably, the most important thing I could say is more and more clients are coming to BlackRock."

One is, I agree with Larry. We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We're, obviously, trying to be more thoughtful as to spending",280,"So thanks, Larry. So I would just echo a couple of things. One is, I agree with Larry. We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We're, obviously, trying to be more thoughtful as to spending in the places we get the greatest impact in the current market. So there's obviously always reallocation and rethinking as to what we want to do with that spend. But I think there's no question that our heads are up, our eyes are forward. And we're continuing to play offense in the market and continuing to invest in all of the strategic initiatives that we've talked at length with you about and discussed again at investor day. So illiquids, factors, portfolio construction, technology, across the board, as Larry said, in terms of alpha generation, digital distribution are on operating platform. Continuing to think smartly about investing in regions, especially in the current environment, were maybe even more important than ever to be local in key markets. And so I think that's exactly right. On the other hand, again, as I echoed, when we talked about our technology growth from a year-over-year perspective, quarterly margins are, obviously -- we are -- even in positive markets, we would basically ask you to look at the trends overall. I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think, looking at longer-term trends is much more indicative of our operating leverage than necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

So obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty in flows, when we looked at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in organic base fee growth for the quarter. I would say that, that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift in sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income, though there was a shift to shorter-duration fixed income, and that does come with a bit of a lower fee more broadly. If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares, but less momentum in higher-fee noncore exposures versus what we've seen historically and, in particular, outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities. On a base fee growth, if we think about those funds, clearly, are relatively higher fee than the core. I think we additionally saw some slower Active Equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which, frankly, is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we've mentioned in the past, on our discussions, divergent data and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and more -- and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
After a strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future. 
Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach, position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before, and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history. Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to, and continually invest in, our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well positioned to serve clients in any market environment. 
BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash, evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities, including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha-seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth. 
Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.
Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat, despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter. 
Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance in long-only equity funds and our broad-based direct and solutions-oriented hedge fund platform. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. 
Overall demand remained strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Advisory and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for Financial Markets Advisory services. 
Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast, even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. 
Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at investor day, we expect to see board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. 
Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher-fee noncore iShares have slowed during the year, as market uncertainty has impacted investors' tactical risk allocation decisions. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources. 
Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter, as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products. 
Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant de-risking activity in the passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion led by continued demand for our target date offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions. 
Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading global credit asset manager and advancing our goal of providing clients with a diverse range of alternative investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry, driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock's cash management business saw a net inflows of $6 billion, as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance. 
We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remained intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth. Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest-growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,571883922,1501097,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2018",2018-07-16,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Po",1768,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing hands in Italy and Mexico. And further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors' confidence. 
Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested, as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth, unfortunately, are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trade that have been, for years, supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking. Over time, this supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets, but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past. If you strip out a handful of outperforming tech stocks, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. 
We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty, and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short-term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years. These rising rates and a flattening curve have made cash not a safe place, but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. 
While investors' caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. Revenues increased 11%. Operating income increased 16%. And our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year. We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across active, index and cash in the second quarter. 
We have seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they are reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues with our clients today have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. 
The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients. 
We remain focused on investing in BlackRock's future to stay ahead of our clients' needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders. 
As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainty, activity has been elevated year-to-date, with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work, and net flows have been more muted as a result. 
Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S.-based clients sought liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource their investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally. 
We are also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions, as the combination of rising rates and resilient equity market levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. 
Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation into customized target date capabilities. LifePath, our target date service -- series has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth. 
This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors' portfolios drove $18 billion of net inflows into iShares. And BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows year-to-date. Because buy-and-hold clients are positioning their portfolio for the long term, they tend to be less sensitive to inter-quarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs. 
We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs. And we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 trillion and $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023. Growth will be driven by core and noncore products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps, both in equities and fixed income exposures. And wealth clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems. Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses. And the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisers is becoming more and more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients. 
Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and a whole portfolio of solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisers who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds. 
Inflows were driven by our strong demand in our top-performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion in net flows, each in our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well positioned for a rising rate environment. 
We achieved the #1 position, gathering active fixed income flow for the quarter in the United States wealth space, where we are delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets are top performing and lowest-priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics and scenario-testing tools across a diverse offering of products from short duration to unconstrained. 
Performance across fixed income strategies remained strong. At the end of the quarter, 78% of our taxable fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for a 1-year period. Our Active Equity is 59% of our fundamental, and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for a 1-year period. 
Strong performance is the foundation of delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows. 
In alternatives, we're seeing more momentum in fundraising than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform, supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and scale distribution. We're beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit, which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space. We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe. 
We also announced the first flows of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first flows reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. 
And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy. We are seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals. 
Cash management is another area where we are gaining share, and we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. With cash strategies earning between approximately 2% and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade, clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset, but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. 
BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows in cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock's diverse business model. 
Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation and evolving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix. 
For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution, to compliance, to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who services those assets through Provider Aladdin as well as for wealth managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad wealth management community. Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity.
Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid-teens range going forward. 
We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer-term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate. 
I want to end by saying we've seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause, but we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So this is going to be something that, I think, will help, in that they will be utilizing their models. Some people will be utilizing our models. We will be comparing the products they have in their clients' portfolios to better products that they might have in their portfolios, suggesting that they might not only use our products, but other people's products to better the portfolios.

They're looking for better tools to navigate their clients' money with better consistency. They're using, as Rob said, more models. And having Aladdin for Wealth allows them to navigate this. And so if anything, we are seeing greater demand for these types of products because it simplifies the process. It creates a better environment for investing, a better environment for compliance and compliance review. And importantly, it has -- it allows the advisers and the firm to better understand all of their clients' risk in comparing the risk associated with all the portfolios, and making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's clients' portfolios. This plays into our strength. This gives us a great opportunity to be more connected with our distribution partner.

It's important not to conflate the multi-asset line item that you see on our financial reconciliation tables to the broader theme of outcome-oriented investing and solutions. But the multi-asset line item did see $8 billion of flows in the quarter, as you mentioned, continued demand for target date offerings, including one significant custom target-date solution for a large client. In addition, strong flows into MAI, or multi-asset income fund and factor-based strategies of about $1 billion each. That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think, as we've mentioned before, that is relevant, not as it relates necessarily to the flow itself. But we do note that, obviously, global allo has a higher fee than LifePath does. And that, obviously, creates some drag on the fee rate and overall revenue growth. But otherwise, we're continuing to invest and believe very strongly in the multi-asset category in and of itself and broader portfolio construction that pulls together lots of different parts of the BlackRock organization into client models and solutions."

So it's -- we'd probably see more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform? Does it create more uncertainties? But if it doesn't and we don't have an all outright tariff war that's increased from this point now, I would say, equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January. We've had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock repurchases. So the amount of underlying equity has shrunk. And PEs have reduced. Now PEs are reduced from the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So if there is more positive clarification that doesn't lead to tariff wars, then the markets would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there's a tariff war, some of it's priced into the market. Some of it's not. But I would say, Michael, that there's some asymmetry here. I think there's probably a little more upside right now than downside, that's -- but let's be clear. If the trade war leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year, so the market is trying to digest all this, as we speak. So I'm pretty calm about it. The one thing I will say this, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty. And the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We're having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on relooking at their risks, on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios.

We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We're, obviously, trying to be more thoughtful as to spending into places we get the greatest impact in the current market. So there's obviously always reallocation and rethinking as to what we want to do with that spend. But I think there's no question that our heads are up, our eyes are forward. And we're continuing to play offense in the market and continuing to invest in all of the strategic initiatives that we've talked at length with you about and discussed again at investor day. So illiquids, factors, portfolio construction, technology, across the board, as Larry said, in terms of alpha generation, digital distribution, our own operating platform. Continuing to think smartly about investing in regions, especially in the current environment, where it may be even more important than ever to be local in key markets. And so I think that's exactly right. On the other hand, again, as I echoed, when we talked about our technology growth from a year-over-year perspective, quarterly margins are, obviously -- we are -- even in positive markets, we would basically ask you to look at the trends overall. I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think, looking at longer-term trends is much more indicative of our operating leverage than necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

So obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty in flows, and when we looked at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in organic base fee growth for the quarter. I would say that, that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift in sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income, though there was a shift to shorter-duration fixed income, and that does come with a bit of a lower fee more broadly. If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares, but less momentum in higher-fee noncore exposures versus what we've seen historically and, in particular, outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering, as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities. On a base fee growth, if we think about it those funds, clearly, are relatively higher fee than the core. I think we additionally saw some slower Active Equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which, frankly, is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we've mentioned in the past in our discussions, divergent beta and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and more -- and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
After a strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future. 
Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach, position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before, and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history. Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to, and continually invest in, our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well positioned to serve clients in any market environment. 
BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash, evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities, including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha-seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth. 
Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.
Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat, despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter. 
Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance in long-only equity funds and our broad-based direct and solutions-oriented hedge fund platform. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. 
Overall demand remained strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Advisory and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for Financial Markets Advisory services. 
Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast, even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. 
Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at investor day, we expect to see board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. 
Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher-fee noncore iShares have slowed during the year, as market uncertainty has impacted investors' tactical risk allocation decisions. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources. 
Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter, as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products. 
Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant de-risking activity in the passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion led by continued demand for our target date offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions. 
Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading global credit asset manager and advancing our goal of providing clients with a diverse range of alternative investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry, driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock's cash management business saw a net inflows of $6 billion, as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance. 
We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remained intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth. Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest-growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Po",1768,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter, as clients recalibrated their risk. Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing hands in Italy and Mexico. And further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors' confidence. 
Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested, as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth, unfortunately, are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trade that have been, for years, supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking. Over time, this supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets, but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past. If you strip out a handful of outperforming tech stocks, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. 
We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty, and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short-term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years. These rising rates and a flattening curve have made cash not a safe place, but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. 
While investors' caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. Revenues increased 11%. Operating income increased 16%. And our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year. We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across active, index and cash in the second quarter. 
We have seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they are reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues with our clients today have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. 
The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients. 
We remain focused on investing in BlackRock's future to stay ahead of our clients' needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders. 
As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainty, activity has been elevated year-to-date, with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work, and net flows have been more muted as a result. 
Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S.-based clients sought liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource their investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally. 
We are also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions, as the combination of rising rates and resilient equity market levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. 
Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation into customized target date capabilities. LifePath, our target date service -- series has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth. 
This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors' portfolios drove $18 billion of net inflows into iShares. And BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows year-to-date. Because buy-and-hold clients are positioning their portfolio for the long term, they tend to be less sensitive to inter-quarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs. 
We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs. And we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 trillion and $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023. Growth will be driven by core and noncore products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps, both in equities and fixed income exposures. And wealth clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems. Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses. And the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisers is becoming more and more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients. 
Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and a whole portfolio of solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisers who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds. 
Inflows were driven by our strong demand in our top-performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion in net flows, each in our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well positioned for a rising rate environment. 
We achieved the #1 position, gathering active fixed income flow for the quarter in the United States wealth space, where we are delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets are top performing and lowest-priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics and scenario-testing tools across a diverse offering of products from short duration to unconstrained. 
Performance across fixed income strategies remained strong. At the end of the quarter, 78% of our taxable fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for a 1-year period. Our Active Equity is 59% of our fundamental, and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for a 1-year period. 
Strong performance is the foundation of delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows. 
In alternatives, we're seeing more momentum in fundraising than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform, supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and scale distribution. We're beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit, which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space. We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe. 
We also announced the first flows of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first flows reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. 
And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy. We are seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals. 
Cash management is another area where we are gaining share, and we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. With cash strategies earning between approximately 2% and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade, clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset, but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. 
BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows in cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock's diverse business model. 
Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation and evolving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix. 
For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution, to compliance, to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who services those assets through Provider Aladdin as well as for wealth managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad wealth management community. Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity.
Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid-teens range going forward. 
We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer-term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate. 
I want to end by saying we've seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause, but we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe.

They're looking for better tools to navigate their clients' money with better consistency. They're using, as Rob said, more models. And having Aladdin for Wealth allows them to navigate this. And so if anything, we are seeing greater demand for these types of products because it simplifies the process. It creates a better environment for investing, a better environment for compliance and compliance review. And importantly, it has -- it allows the advisers and the firm to better understand all of their clients' risk in comparing the risk associated with all the portfolios, and making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's clients' portfolios. This plays into our strength. This gives us a great opportunity to be more connected with our distribution partner.

But the multi-asset line item did see $8 billion of flows in the quarter, as you mentioned, continued demand for target date offerings, including one significant custom target-date solution for a large client. In addition, strong flows into MAI, or multi-asset income fund and factor-based strategies of about $1 billion each. That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think, as we've mentioned before, that is relevant, not as it relates necessarily to the flow itself. But we do note that, obviously, global allo has a higher fee than LifePath does. And that, obviously, creates some drag on the fee rate and overall revenue growth.

So it's -- we'd probably see more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform? Does it create more uncertainties? But if it doesn't and we don't have an all outright tariff war that's increased from this point now, I would say, equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January. We've had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock repurchases. So the amount of underlying equity has shrunk. And PEs have reduced. Now PEs are reduced from the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So if there is more positive clarification that doesn't lead to tariff wars, then the markets would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there's a tariff war, some of it's priced into the market. Some of it's not. But I would say, Michael, that there's some asymmetry here. I think there's probably a little more upside right now than downside, that's -- but let's be clear. If the trade war leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year, so the market is trying to digest all this, as we speak. So I'm pretty calm about it. The one thing I will say this, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty. And the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We're having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on relooking at their risks, on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios.

I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think, looking at longer-term trends is much more indicative of our operating leverage than necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

So obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty in flows, and when we looked at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in organic base fee growth for the quarter. I would say that, that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift in sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income, though there was a shift to shorter-duration fixed income, and that does come with a bit of a lower fee more broadly. If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares, but less momentum in higher-fee noncore exposures versus what we've seen historically and, in particular, outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering, as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities. On a base fee growth, if we think about it those funds, clearly, are relatively higher fee than the core. I think we additionally saw some slower Active Equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which, frankly, is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we've mentioned in the past in our discussions, divergent beta and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and more -- and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in."

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we noted the clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pick up in industry flows during the third quarter primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continuing trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets and the steepening yield curve. 
Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses, such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. 
BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP group and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by higher day count in the third quarter. Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis points sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continue to underperform developed markets. 
While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging market exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of data divergence intensifying towards the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that once again delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has thus far been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new client sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low to mid-teens growth for our technology business over the long term. 
Total expense increased 3% year-over-year driven primarily by higher G&A and volume-related expense. Quarterly, G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct front expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. In alignment of that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that gathered a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. 
We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider of Mexico and Tennenbaum Capital Partners enhancing our private credit capabilities. In addition, we completed the transfer of our U.K.-defined contribution administration business to, and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies and illiquid alternatives offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. iShares' flows beyond the quarter rebound after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. 
Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission for the iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission-free than ever before. Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income led by municipals, unconstrained in high yield strategies and event-driven liquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S. equities. 
In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continue to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI fixed income and illiquid alternatives. 
Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of global energy and power infrastructure fund 3. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platforms saw a $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and Cachematrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market manager globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. 
BlackRock's scale, global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We have shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client, and we remain focused on playing offense by striking the appropriate balance between organic and investing for future growth and practical, discretionary expense management. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we once again delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. An",1916,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we once again delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we've been through these tough markets, top market environments before, and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth though asset management flow -- through asset management flows and technology revenues while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. 
We built our platform around a holistic, client-centric approach. And today, we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies and technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter and have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. 
After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing for it around the world. Concerns over trade tensions and particularly are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. economy is adding to investor concerns about overeating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated Federal Reserve rate hikes. Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019, driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil, the presidential election is intensifying political polarization. 
These developments are all heightening worldwide investors’ concerns. As a result, financial market performance continues to diverge in 2018 while U.S. equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by a strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year ago and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. 
Short term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment, even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant, significant partnerships with a large -- with large long term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. 
BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. One of the most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows and BlackRock once again captured the #1 share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.
iShares' core products generated $20 billion of net inflows in the quarter, long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core broad market exposures often through model portfolios. In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed income ETFs. Fixed income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category has seen an excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last 4 years, and we expect strong secular growth to continue. 
Fixed income ETFs provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity, and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. This quarter, BlackRock in partnership with the CBOE launched the first iShares high yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. 
In addition to ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index of fixed income strategies as they look for solutions across risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed income platform where 84% of our fundamental and fixed income assets are above benchmarks or fair mediums for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed income mutual funds in the quarter led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed income inflows led by liability-driven investment strategies in the U.S. 
With rising interest rates U.S. equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S. pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong, and we have more closely integrated LDI with a global fixed income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed income and cash flow solution. Our Active Equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our fundamental Active Equity's up 11% from last year and 92% of our systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark for pair medium for the 5-year period. 
In alternatives, the investments we have made to position BlackRock as an industry-leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through our combination of organic and inorganic growth, our growth alternative platform is now $109 billion including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset raising and sourcing. 
Our illiquid platform, we have raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months and our market share of illiquid alternatives industry fundraising has more than doubled in the last 2 years. We expect continued growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and clients' future needs. Our strategy is focused first and foremost, on our clients and their evolving needs, from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives and our long term aspiration include being the first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately, a leader in the Chinese asset management business. 
As the assets and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. In U.S. as well, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisers now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August, they added 170 commission-free iShares ETFs shares to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner, Scottish and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. 
More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform, including our most comprehensive range of market cap-weighted, factor-based, Alpha-seeking and illiquid alternative strategies, with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. 
Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increasing demand from clients globally, coupled with BlackRock's investment in technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with West Cap on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wescap and offer it to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing and financial objectives. Potentially, the greatest client need of our time, however, is a global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive this solution and this prices and has made this challenge a strategic priority. 
Last month, we announced the establishment of a new retirement solutions group, which will explore BlackRock's access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients' most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. Today, insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic, flexible technology-driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments. At times with these types of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. 
These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools. Like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year, and we expect these trends to continue to drive low to mid-teens growth on an annual basis going forward. The impact of technologies extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we are transforming our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering trading technology powered by Cachematrix to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management of BlackRock is now a technology business. 
Whether it be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We are leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients around the globe. Indeed, we believe that especially in markets like these, while clients may be slow in putting money to work, they are putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

So what happens especially during that type of volatility period is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple of weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we have seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board, most of them already down 2% to 4%. So getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they've just risked -- de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is even in that de-risking to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they're going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically, they'll do that in the noncore iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they are more buy and hold. So we see that more in the active products. And I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter."

We're not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain and political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We've seen this in the past generally in the fourth quarter, we see client adding risk that is typically what happens especially November, December. And so I'm not here to tell you I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see large interest from our clients than in our technology businesses. We're continuing to see large interest from clients in our alternative space, and let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset and alts. The only area where we have outflows that were significant was in low fee index product, and that's, I think Rob Kapito has talked about this for years. That's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say, unlike most organizations in the industry, we have positive flows in [ U.S. ] as well in our retail side. don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I can say is we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients.

I think it's -- we remain committed to obviously first investing in our business and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders. That will continue.

But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and then paying the incremental back. As we have said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all various opportunities for investment in the business, whether through our P&L, through our C capital, through our tax inorganic opportunities. We've been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million, and we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously, as you know, we've never been capital constrained, either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We're levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities."

And I don't know if that story really got out that well because especially at Fidelity, what was not -- what was hidden I think in that communication was the actually added over 170 new ETFs in their platform commission-free. So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform, and it attracts many more investors because trading costs. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers, and that's been positive to us so our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission-free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the #1 market share globally of ETFs, so we really have more people on it, will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there'll be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of big ESG ETFs coming on the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there, and I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully, they'll express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, and they've been great partners who have the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market.

And so we actually believe commission-free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement, it's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement. And I believe this is a really important trend in all the ETF industry and I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of closing money for retirement.

They actually work, so the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So, in essence, I would say brand is still very important, liquidity, and that's due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they're using this to really focus on one of the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward; and the second thing will be the ESG, whereas large plans have the responsibility now to be asked by their boards to express that in their portfolios, I think they're going to want to express it in ETFs that have that brand that also have the liquidity in it."

And I don't believe those 2 components lead to each other. So we're not seeing any indication, any issues related to a worsening of prices related to the noncore, but core -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals, and that continue to be a major component. And those core products just don't have the liquidity that some of the noncore strategies have. They don't have -- in some of the noncore strategies now have options against it, and they have a much more derivative based market around that, too. And so almost 2 different ecosystems both serving their clients, and this is what's great about it in their specific needs.

The other area where you're seeing especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business and one of the reasons why we believe over the next 5 years, ETFs will double in size, is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consult of relationship or advice, they're using more models.

Now that the markets resetting itself, I think the rebalancing on equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure only moved, I don't know of the [indiscernible] 30 basis points so it's not a significant move. But net-net, you're going to see more and more pension funds using as you raise LDI, we're seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDI's, one of our growth areas in the last quarter, it continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be, we'll see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year. But we do believe the trend will be over the long term for pension funds to reduce the exposures in their defined benefit plans as more and more high contribution so it is we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyd's, we don't describe what the client is doing. The client came out with the press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them.

I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component, that is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years has been our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter. And you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment. Look, I think for us, we have purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product, but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client-centric solution to our clients. And we've seen typical markets before, but we think that our unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately in our display, whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we've done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost down to invest for growth, and that's really the hard part. But we think we've got a model advantage, and so our intent is to continue to invest through the cycle on behalf of our clients and our shareholders."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we noted the clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pick up in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continuing trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets and the steepening yield curve. 
Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses, such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. 
BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income, driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits, primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by higher day count in the third quarter. 
Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis points sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continued to underperform developed markets. 
While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates, was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging market exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. 
Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that, once again, delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has, thus far, been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new client sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low- to mid-teens growth for our technology business over the long term. 
Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume-related expense. Quarterly, G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher-growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. 
In alignment of that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that gathered a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider of Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. 
In addition, we completed the transfer of our U.K.-defined contribution administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies and illiquid alternatives, offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. 
iShares' flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long-duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. 
Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission-free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission-free than ever before. 
Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income, led by municipals, unconstrained in high yield strategies, and event-driven illiquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S. equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. 
Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continue to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI fixed income and illiquid alternatives. 
Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever, as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform, highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund III. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platform saw a $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and Cachematrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market manager globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. 
BlackRock's scale, global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We have shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client, and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical, discretionary expense management. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds.",1910,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we've been through these tough markets, tough market environments before, and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth though asset management flow -- through asset management flows and technology revenues while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. 
We built our platform around a holistic, client-centric approach. And today, we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies and technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter and have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence in monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. 
After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions in particular are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated Federal Reserve rate hikes. 
Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019, driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil, the presidential election is intensifying political polarization. 
These developments are all heightening worldwide investors’ concerns. As a result, financial market performance continues to diverge in 2018. While U.S. equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year ago, and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture, highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. 
Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment, even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. 
Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant, significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. 
BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. 
One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows, and BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.
iShares' core products generated $20 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core, broad market exposures, often through model portfolios. 
In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed income ETFs. Fixed income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category has seen an excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last 4 years, and we expect strong secular growth to continue. 
Fixed income ETFs provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. 
This quarter, BlackRock, in partnership with the CBOE, launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. 
In addition to the ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed income platform where 84% of our fundamental fixed income assets are above benchmarks or peer median for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed income mutual funds in the quarter, led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed income inflows, led by liability-driven investment strategies in the U.S. 
With rising interest rates, U.S. equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S. pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong, and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed income and cash flow solution. 
Our Active Equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our fundamental Active Equity's up 11% from last year, and 92% of our systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. 
In alternatives, the investments we have made to position BlackRock as an industry-leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion, including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset-raising and sourcing. 
Our illiquid platform, we have raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months, and our market share of illiquid alternatives industry fundraising has more than doubled in the last 2 years. We expect continued growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. 
BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and clients' future needs. Our strategy is focused, first and foremost, on our clients and their evolving needs, from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives, and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately, a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. 
In US Wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisers now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. 
Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added 170 commission-free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. 
BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. 
More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform, including our most comprehensive range of market cap-weighted, factor-based, alpha-seeking and illiquid alternatives strategies, with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. 
Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increasing demand from clients globally, coupled with BlackRock's investment in technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low-carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer it to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing and financial objectives. 
Potentially, the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. 
Last month, we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients' most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. 
Today, insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic, flexible technology-driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. 
These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year, and we expect these trends to continue to drive low- to mid-teens growth on an annual basis going forward. 
The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we are transforming our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering trading technology, powered by Cachematrix, to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management of BlackRock is now a technology business. 
Whether it be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We are leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. 
This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that, especially in markets like these, while clients may be slow in putting money to work, they are putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period, is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple of weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we have seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board, most of them are already down 2% to 4%. So getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they've de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is, even in that de-risking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they're going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically, they'll do that in the noncore iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they are more buy and hold. So we see that more in the active products. And I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter."

We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of those was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We're not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We've seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk. That is typically what happens especially November, December. And so I'm not here to tell you I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see a large interest from our clients in our technology businesses. We're continuing to see large interest from clients in our alternatives space. And let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset and alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in low fee index products. And that's -- I think Rob Kapito has talked about this for years. That's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say, unlike most organizations in the industry, we have positive flows in US Wealth in our retail side. I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I can say is we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients. And we'll see how that plays out."

I think it's -- we remain committed to, obviously, first investing in our business and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders. That will continue.

But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and then paying the incremental back. As we have said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business, whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We've been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million. And we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously, as you know, we've never been capital-constrained, either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We're levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities."

And I don't know if that story really got out that well. Because especially at Fidelity, what was not -- what was hidden, I think, in the communication was they actually added over 170 new ETFs to their platform commission-free. So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform. And it attracts many more investors because there's no trading cost. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers. And that's been positive to us so our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission-free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the #1 market share globally of ETFs. So we really have more people on it. It will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there'll be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of big ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there. And I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully, they'll express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, and they've been great partners. We've had the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market.

So when you're trying to save for retirement and you're only investing, let's say, $1,000 at a time, the commissions were eating up quite a bit of return. And so we actually believe commission-free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement, it's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement. And I believe this is a really important trend in all the ETF industry, and I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of pools of money for retirement.

So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity, and that's due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they're using this to really focus on one of the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward.

But core is -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals, and that continue to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have the liquidity that some of the noncore strategies have. They don't have -- and some of the noncore strategies now have options against it, and they have a much more derivative-based market around that, too. And so they're almost 2 different ecosystems both serving their clients, and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have a long-term need to invest for retirement, and that's a buy-and-hold. And that's why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy.

The other area where you're seeing, especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons why we believe over the next 5 years, ETFs will double in size, is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consult of relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products.

Now that the market's resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure is only moved, I don't know, off a year, 30 basis points, so it's not a significant move. But net-net, you're going to see more and more pension funds using, as you raised, LDI. We're seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDIs. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter, and it continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We'll see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year. But we do believe the trend will be over the long term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans as more and more money is now moving into high contribution, so it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don't describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a GBP 30 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives where we believe we're going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform.

We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is, when it goes up, it creates a noise in our G&A line. The good news is, when it goes up, it means the deals we have done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the First Reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in coming quarters has gone up, which is why we are at fair value in that.

I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment, look, I think for us, we have purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client-centric solution to our clients. And we've seen typical markets before, but we think that our unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately in our display, whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we've done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that's really the hard part. But we think we've got a model advantage.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we noted the clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pick up in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continuing trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets and the steepening yield curve. 
Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses, such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. 
BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income, driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits, primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by higher day count in the third quarter. 
Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis points sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continued to underperform developed markets. 
While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates, was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging market exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. 
Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that, once again, delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has, thus far, been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new clients sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low- to mid-teens growth for our technology business over the long term. 
Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume-related expense. Quarterly, G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher-growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. 
In alignment of that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that added a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider of Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. 
In addition, we completed the transfer of our U.K.-defined contribution administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies and illiquid alternatives, offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. 
iShares' flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long-duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. 
Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission-free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission-free than ever before. 
Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income, led by municipals, unconstrained in high yield strategies, and event-driven illiquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S. equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. 
Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continue to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI fixed income and illiquid alternatives. 
Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever, as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform, highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund III. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platform saw  $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and Cachematrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market manager globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. 
BlackRock's scale, global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We have shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client, and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical, discretionary expense management. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds.",1911,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we've been through these tough markets, tough market environments before, and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth though asset management flow -- through asset management flows and technology revenues while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. 
We built our platform around a holistic, client-centric approach. And today, we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies and technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter and have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence in monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. 
After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions in particular are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated Federal Reserve rate hikes. 
Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019, driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil, the presidential election is intensifying political polarization. 
These developments are all heightening worldwide investors’ concerns. As a result, financial market performance continues to diverge in 2018. While U.S. equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year ago, and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture, highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. 
Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment, even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. 
Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant, significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. 
BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. 
One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows, and BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.
iShares' core products generated $20 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core, broad market exposures, often through model portfolios. 
In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed income ETFs. Fixed income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category has seen an excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last 4 years, and we expect strong secular growth to continue. 
Fixed income ETFs provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. 
This quarter, BlackRock, in partnership with the CBOE, launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. 
In addition to the ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed income platform where 84% of our fundamental fixed income assets are above benchmarks or peer median for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed income mutual funds in the quarter, led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed income inflows, led by liability-driven investment strategies in the U.S. 
With rising interest rates, U.S. equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S. pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong, and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed income and cash flow solution. 
Our Active Equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our fundamental Active Equity's up 11% from last year, and 92% of our systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. 
In alternatives, the investments we have made to position BlackRock as an industry-leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion, including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset-raising and sourcing. 
Across our illiquid platform, we have raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months, and our market share of illiquid alternatives industry fundraising has more than doubled in the last 2 years. We expect continued growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. 
BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and clients' future needs. Our strategy is focused, first and foremost, on our clients and their evolving needs, from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives, and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately, a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. 
In US Wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisers now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. 
Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added 170 commission-free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. 
BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. 
More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform, including our most comprehensive range of market cap-weighted, factor-based, alpha-seeking and illiquid alternatives strategies, with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. 
Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increasing demand from clients globally, coupled with BlackRock's investment in technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low-carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer it to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing and financial objectives. 
Potentially, the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. 
Last month, we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients' most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. 
Today, insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic, flexible technology-driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. 
These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year, and we expect these trends to continue to drive low- to mid-teens growth on an annual basis going forward. 
The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we are transforming our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering trading technology, powered by Cachematrix, to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management of BlackRock is now a technology business. 
Whether it be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We are leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. 
This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that, especially in markets like these, while clients may be slow in putting money to work, they are putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period, is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple of weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we have seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board, most of them are already down 2% to 4%. So getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they've de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is, even in that de-risking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they're going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically, they'll do that in the noncore iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they are more buy and hold. So we see that more in the active products. And I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter."

We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of those was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We're not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We've seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk. That is typically what happens especially November, December. And so I'm not here to tell you I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see a large interest from our clients in our technology businesses. We're continuing to see large interest from clients in our alternatives space. And let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset and alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in low fee index products. And that's -- I think Rob Kapito has talked about this for years. That's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say, unlike most organizations in the industry, we have positive flows in US Wealth in our retail side. I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I can say is we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients. And we'll see how that plays out."

I think it's -- we remain committed to, obviously, first investing in our business and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders. That will continue. Obviously, it's not necessarily tied to any 12-month period of time. We look at cash over a broader period of time than that because we try not to be that specific. But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and then paying the incremental back. As we have said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business, whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We've been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million. And we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously, as you know, we've never been capital-constrained, either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We're levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities."

And I don't know if that story really got out that well. Because especially at Fidelity, what was not -- what was hidden, I think, in the communication was they actually added over 170 new ETFs to their platform commission-free. So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform. And it attracts many more investors because there's no trading cost. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers. And that's been positive to us so our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission-free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the #1 market share globally of ETFs. So if we really have more people on it, it will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there'll be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of big ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there. And I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully, they'll express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, and they've been great partners. We've had the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market. So very optimistic as new buyers can enter the market commission-free."

So when you're trying to save for retirement and you're only investing, let's say, $1,000 at a time, the commissions were eating up quite a bit of return. And so we actually believe commission-free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement, it's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement. And I believe this is a really important trend in all the ETF industry, and I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of pools of money for retirement. So we look at this as it's not just important for the ETF industry, we believe it's an important contributor to the strategies of the wealth management platforms as they try to help clients navigate the whole cumbersome component of retirement.

So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity, and that's due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they're using this to really focus on what are the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward.

But core is -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals, and that continues to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have the liquidity that some of the noncore strategies have. They don't have -- and some of the noncore strategies now have options against it, and they have a much more derivative-based market around that, too. And so they're almost 2 different ecosystems both serving their clients, and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have a long-term need to invest for retirement, and that's a buy-and-hold. And that's why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy.

And so it is through technology that is advancing our positioning with our wires. It is trying to work with them on ETF strategies. But I actually believe the relationships that we have with the wires now are more comprehensive, more holistic than anytime ever. And we believe, like we just said -- as I said, this -- last week was when we went live with Morgan Stanley, we believe through those processes, we're going to start seeing in maybe the fourth quarter in 2019, increased flows through our holistic relationships with our wires of all our strategic partners. The other area where you're seeing, especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons why we believe over the next 5 years, ETFs will double in size, is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consultive relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products. And so we believe over time, we're getting ourselves better positioned to have deeper, more holistic relationships, and we continue to believe that is what's going to be driving our future growth."

Now that the market's resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure has only moved, I don't know, on the year, 30 basis points, so it's not a significant move. But net-net, you're going to see more and more pension funds using, as you raised, LDI. We're seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDIs. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter, and it continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We'll see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year. But we do believe the trend will be over the long term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans as more and more money is now moving into high contribution, so it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don't describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a GBP 30 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives where we believe we're going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform. We are looking at -- they're looking at utilization of our Aladdin platform and other forms of technology. So it's a comprehensive relationship. It is deep and related to the other pool of assets.

And again, we've tried to give you a little bit more visibility through some better disclosure, both in the press release and the Q. But there's a portion of that, that is more professional fee-related, as I mentioned, about $13 million tied to closing a number of transactions that clearly will come out. The contingent purchase price adjustments is going to be a part of our P&L for some period of time. We have about 250-plus million dollars of contingent purchase price liability on our balance sheet. We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is, when it goes up, it creates some noise in our G&A line. The good news is, when it goes up, it means the deals we have done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the First Reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in coming quarters has gone up, which is why we are at fair value in that. So we will do as best we can to call that out for you so that you can see some of that volatility in what we would consider kind of more nonrecurring core G&A expense. In terms of expectations for the fourth quarter, I think you've got it right on. I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component, that kind of is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years is that our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter. And you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment, look, I think for us, we have purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client-centric solution to our clients. And we've seen typical markets before, but we think that our unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately in our display, whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we've done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that's really the hard part. But we think we've got a model advantage.

As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we noted the clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pickup in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continuing trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets and the steepening yield curve. 
Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses, such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. 
BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income, driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits, primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by higher day count in the third quarter. 
Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis points sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continued to underperform developed markets. 
While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates, was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging market exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. 
Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that, once again, delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has, thus far, been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new clients sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low- to mid-teens growth for our technology business over the long term. 
Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume-related expense. Quarterly, G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher-growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. 
In alignment of that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that added a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider of Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. 
In addition, we completed the transfer of our U.K.-defined contribution administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies and illiquid alternatives, offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. 
iShares' flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long-duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. 
Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission-free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission-free than ever before. 
Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income, led by municipals, unconstrained in high yield strategies, and event-driven illiquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S. equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. 
Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continue to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI fixed income and illiquid alternatives. 
Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever, as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform, highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund III. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platform saw $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and Cachematrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market manager globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. 
BlackRock's scale, global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We have shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client, and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical, discretionary expense management. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds.",1911,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we've been through these tough markets, tough market environments before, and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth though asset management flow -- through asset management flows and technology revenues while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. 
We built our platform around a holistic, client-centric approach. And today, we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies and technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter and have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence in monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. 
After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions in particular are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated Federal Reserve rate hikes. 
Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019, driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil, the presidential election is intensifying political polarization. 
These developments are all heightening worldwide investors’ concerns. As a result, financial market performance continues to diverge in 2018. While U.S. equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year ago, and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture, highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. 
Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment, even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. 
Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant, significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. 
BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. 
One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows, and BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.
iShares' core products generated $20 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core, broad market exposures, often through model portfolios. 
In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed income ETFs. Fixed income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category has seen an excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last 4 years, and we expect strong secular growth to continue. 
Fixed income ETFs provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. 
This quarter, BlackRock, in partnership with the CBOE, launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. 
In addition to the ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed income platform where 84% of our fundamental fixed income assets are above benchmarks or peer median for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed income mutual funds in the quarter, led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed income inflows, led by liability-driven investment strategies in the U.S. 
With rising interest rates, U.S. equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S. pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong, and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed income and cash flow solution. 
Our Active Equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our fundamental Active Equity's up 11% from last year, and 92% of our systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. 
In alternatives, the investments we have made to position BlackRock as an industry-leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion, including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset-raising and sourcing. 
Across our illiquid platform, we have raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months, and our market share of illiquid alternatives industry fundraising has more than doubled in the last 2 years. We expect continued growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. 
BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and clients' future needs. Our strategy is focused, first and foremost, on our clients and their evolving needs, from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives, and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately, a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. 
In US Wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisers now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. 
Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added 170 commission-free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. 
BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. 
More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform, including our most comprehensive range of market cap-weighted, factor-based, alpha-seeking and illiquid alternatives strategies, with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. 
Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increasing demand from clients globally, coupled with BlackRock's investment in technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low-carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer it to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing and financial objectives. 
Potentially, the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. 
Last month, we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients' most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. 
Today, insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic, flexible technology-driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. 
These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year, and we expect these trends to continue to drive low- to mid-teens growth on an annual basis going forward. 
The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we are transforming our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering trading technology, powered by Cachematrix, to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management of BlackRock is now a technology business. 
Whether it be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We are leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. 
This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that, especially in markets like these, while clients may be slow in putting money to work, they are putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period, is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple of weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we have seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board, most of them are already down 2% to 4%. So getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they've de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is, even in that de-risking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they're going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically, they'll do that in the noncore iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they are more buy and hold. So we see that more in the active products. And I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter."

We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of those was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We're not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We've seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk. That is typically what happens especially November, December. And so I'm not here to tell you I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see a large interest from our clients in our technology businesses. We're continuing to see large interest from clients in our alternatives space. And let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset and alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in low fee index products. And that's -- I think Rob Kapito has talked about this for years. That's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say, unlike most organizations in the industry, we have positive flows in US Wealth in our retail side. I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I can say is we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients. And we'll see how that plays out."

But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and then paying the incremental back. As we have said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business, whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We've been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million. And we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously, as you know, we've never been capital-constrained, either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We're levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities."

So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform. And it attracts many more investors because there's no trading cost. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers. And that's been positive to us so our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission-free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the #1 market share globally of ETFs. So if we really have more people on it, it will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there'll be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of big ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there. And I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully, they'll express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, and they've been great partners. We've had the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market. So very optimistic as new buyers can enter the market commission-free."

I believe more and more of the market for ETFs will be commission-free. I think it's incredibly important. So for the retail investor, commissions, the trading commissions can be larger than the commissions or the fees of the asset manager. So when you're trying to save for retirement and you're only investing, let's say, $1,000 at a time, the commissions were eating up quite a bit of return. And so we actually believe commission-free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement, it's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement. And I believe this is a really important trend in all the ETF industry, and I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of pools of money for retirement. So we look at this as it's not just important for the ETF industry, we believe it's an important contributor to the strategies of the wealth management platforms as they try to help clients navigate the whole cumbersome component of retirement. And we believe a commission-free environment for ETFs is going to lead to far better outcomes of investing for retirement."

So price has been a key differentiator in core ETFs, the majority of your ETFs are noncore. What are the longer-term success factors in noncore? So you have mentioned liquidity as a factor, maybe a key factor in the past. Does liquidity remain a key driver for the noncore ETF sales? Or does that become less differentiated as the ETF market grows? To Michael's question, you mentioned commission-free trading and distribution relationships are important. You alluded to product development in ESG. But what is most important for noncore ETF growth over time? And what does that say about the pricing that you think you could get for noncore?

So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity, and that's due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they're using this to really focus on what are the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward.

And I don't believe those 2 components lead to each other. So we're not seeing any indication, any issues related to a worsening of prices related to the noncore. But core is -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals, and that continues to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have the liquidity that some of the noncore strategies have. They don't have -- and some of the noncore strategies now have options against it, and they have a much more derivative-based market around that, too. And so they're almost 2 different ecosystems both serving their clients, and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have a long-term need to invest for retirement, and that's a buy-and-hold. And that's why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy. And we have a large component of our institutional clients worldwide are using it for asset allocation. They're using it for its closures. And branded liquidity is very important and remains to be important."

So we did begin to see that, and we continue to believe that will continue to yield more flows. In terms of the wires, I mean, one of the great success stories so far that's just been implemented and one just was launched in its existence is Aladdin for Wealth. So UBS and Morgan Stanley both use Aladdin for Wealth. We have other organizations that we're working on. We have actually other organizations worldwide that are adopting Aladdin for Wealth. And so it is through technology that is advancing our positioning with our wires. It is trying to work with them on ETF strategies. But I actually believe the relationships that we have with the wires now are more comprehensive, more holistic than any time ever. And we believe, like we just said -- as I said, this -- last week was when we went live with Morgan Stanley, we believe through those processes, we're going to start seeing in maybe the fourth quarter in 2019, increased flows through our holistic relationships with our wires of all our strategic partners. The other area where you're seeing, especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons why we believe over the next 5 years, ETFs will double in size, is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consultive relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products. And so we believe over time, we're getting ourselves better positioned to have deeper, more holistic relationships, and we continue to believe that is what's going to be driving our future growth."

Now that the market's resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure has only moved, I don't know, on the year, 30 basis points, so it's not a significant move. But net-net, you're going to see more and more pension funds using, as you raised, LDI. We're seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDIs. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter, and it continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We'll see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year. But we do believe the trend will be over the long term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans as more and more money is now moving into high contribution, so it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don't describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a GBP 30 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives where we believe we're going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform. We are looking at -- they're looking at utilization of our Aladdin platform and other forms of technology. So it's a comprehensive relationship. It is deep and related to the other pool of assets.

And again, we've tried to give you a little bit more visibility through some better disclosure, both in the press release and the Q. But there's a portion of that, that is more professional fee-related, as I mentioned, about $13 million tied to closing a number of transactions that clearly will come out. The contingent purchase price adjustments is going to be a part of our P&L for some period of time. We have about 250-plus million dollars of contingent purchase price liability on our balance sheet. We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is, when it goes up, it creates some noise in our G&A line. The good news is, when it goes up, it means the deals we have done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the First Reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in coming quarters has gone up, which is why we are at fair value in that. So we will do as best we can to call that out for you so that you can see some of that volatility in what we would consider kind of more nonrecurring core G&A expense. In terms of expectations for the fourth quarter, I think you've got it right on. I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component, that kind of is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years is that our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter. And you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment, look, I think for us, we have purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client-centric solution to our clients. And we've seen typical markets before, but we think that our unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately in our display, whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we've done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that's really the hard part. But we think we've got a model advantage. And so our intent is to continue to invest through the cycle on behalf of our clients and our shareholders."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we noted the clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pickup in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated derisking by many clients in an environment marked by continuing trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets and the steepening yield curve. 
Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses, such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. 
BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income, driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits, primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by higher day count in the third quarter. 
Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis points sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continued to underperform developed markets. 
While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates, was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging market exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. 
Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that, once again, delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has, thus far, been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new clients sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low- to mid-teens growth for our technology business over the long term. 
Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume-related expense. Quarterly, G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher-growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. 
In alignment of that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that added a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex asset management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider of Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. 
In addition, we completed the transfer of our U.K.-defined contribution administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies and illiquid alternatives, offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. 
iShares' flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long-duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. 
Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission-free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission-free than ever before. 
Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income, led by municipals, unconstrained in high yield strategies, and event-driven illiquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S. equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. 
Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continue to derisk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI fixed income and illiquid alternatives. 
Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever, as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform, highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund III. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platform saw $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and Cachematrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market manager globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. 
BlackRock's scale, global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We have shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client, and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical, discretionary expense management. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,584824172,1571677,"BlackRock, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds.",1911,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. And thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates the resilience of our differentiated platform as we, once again, delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we've been through these tough markets, tough market environments before, and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth though asset management flow -- through asset management flows and technology revenues while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. 
We built our platform around a holistic, client-centric approach. And today, we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies and technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter and have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence in monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. 
After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions in particular are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated Federal Reserve rate hikes. 
Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019, driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil, the presidential election is intensifying political polarization. 
These developments are all heightening worldwide investors’ concerns. As a result, financial market performance continues to diverge in 2018. While U.S. equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year ago, and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture, highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. 
Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment, even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. 
Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant, significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are derisking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. 
BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. 
One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows, and BlackRock, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.
iShares' core products generated $20 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core, broad market exposures, often through model portfolios. 
In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed income ETFs. Fixed income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category has seen an excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last 4 years, and we expect strong secular growth to continue. 
Fixed income ETFs provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. 
This quarter, BlackRock, in partnership with the CBOE, launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. 
In addition to the ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed income platform where 84% of our fundamental fixed income assets are above benchmarks or peer median for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed income mutual funds in the quarter, led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed income inflows, led by liability-driven investment strategies in the U.S. 
With rising interest rates, U.S. equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S. pension funding ratios improving, client demand to derisk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong, and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed income and cash flow solution. 
Our Active Equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our fundamental Active Equity's up 11% from last year, and 92% of our systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. 
In alternatives, the investments we have made to position BlackRock as an industry-leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion, including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset-raising and sourcing. 
Across our illiquid platform, we have raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months, and our market share of illiquid alternatives industry fundraising has more than doubled in the last 2 years. We expect continued growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. 
BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and clients' future needs. Our strategy is focused, first and foremost, on our clients and their evolving needs, from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives, and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately, a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. 
In US Wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisers now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. 
Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added 170 commission-free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. 
BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. 
More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform, including our most comprehensive range of market cap-weighted, factor-based, alpha-seeking and illiquid alternatives strategies, with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. 
Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increasing demand from clients globally, coupled with BlackRock's investment in technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low-carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer it to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing and financial objectives. 
Potentially, the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. 
Last month, we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients' most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. 
Today, insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic, flexible technology-driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. 
These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year, and we expect these trends to continue to drive low- to mid-teens growth on an annual basis going forward. 
The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we are transforming our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering trading technology, powered by Cachematrix, to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management of BlackRock is now a technology business. 
Whether it be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We are leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. 
This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we're having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that, especially in markets like these, while clients may be slow in putting money to work, they are putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period, is clients derisk. So depending upon the next couple of weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to derisk. Certainly, we have seen the hedge funds derisk from a period of time where I think across the board, most of them are already down 2% to 4%. So getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they've derisked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either derisking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is, even in that derisking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they're going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can derisk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically, they'll do that in the noncore iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they are more buy and hold. So we see that more in the active products. And I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter."

We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of those was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We're not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We've seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk. That is typically what happens especially November, December. And so I'm not here to tell you I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see a large interest from our clients in our technology businesses. We're continuing to see large interest from clients in our alternatives space. And let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset and alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in low fee index products. And that's -- I think Rob Kapito has talked about this for years. That's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say, unlike most organizations in the industry, we have positive flows in US Wealth in our retail side. I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I can say is we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients. And we'll see how that plays out."

I think it's -- we remain committed to, obviously, first investing in our business and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders. That will continue.

But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and then paying the incremental back. As we have said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business, whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We've been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million. And we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously, as you know, we've never been capital-constrained, either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We're levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities."

So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform. And it attracts many more investors because there's no trading cost. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers. And that's been positive to us so our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission-free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the #1 market share globally of ETFs. So if we really have more people on it, it will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there'll be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of big ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there. And I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully, they'll express that through our iShares.

So you have mentioned liquidity as a factor, maybe a key factor in the past. Does liquidity remain a key driver for the noncore ETF sales? Or does that become less differentiated as the ETF market grows? To Michael's question, you mentioned commission-free trading and distribution relationships are important. You alluded to product development in ESG. But what is most important for noncore ETF growth over time? And what does that say about the pricing that you think you could get for noncore? Will it hold up? Or does it sort of eventually mirror the core side?"

So this is what those people that are more active and they participate in their noncore want in purchasing their ETFs. And I think that what hasn't been talked about is this last move in volatility. We haven't seen any stories of any issues in the liquidity of ETFs. All of a sudden, that is off the front page. They actually work. So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity, and that's due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they're using this to really focus on what are the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward. And the second thing will be the ESG, where as large plans have the responsibility now to be asked by their boards to express that in their portfolios, I think they're going to want to express it in ETFs that have that brand that also have the liquidity in it."

I think retail continues to be focused on more core-oriented strategies for their, I would say, their large component of their investment strategies. But as ETFs expand, whether it is ESG that Rob was talking about or factor-based or emerging markets in other areas, we still believe that, as Rob said, brand and liquidity are major components. And I don't believe those 2 components lead to each other. So we're not seeing any indication, any issues related to a worsening of prices related to the noncore. But core is -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals, and that continues to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have the liquidity that some of the noncore strategies have. They don't have -- and some of the noncore strategies now have options against it, and they have a much more derivative-based market around that, too. And so they're almost 2 different ecosystems both serving their clients, and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have a long-term need to invest for retirement, and that's a buy-and-hold. And that's why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy. And we have a large component of our institutional clients worldwide are using it for asset allocation. They're using it for its closures. And branded liquidity is very important and remains to be important."

So we did begin to see that, and we continue to believe that will continue to yield more flows. In terms of the wires, I mean, one of the great success stories so far that's just been implemented and one just was launched in its existence is Aladdin for Wealth. So UBS and Morgan Stanley both use Aladdin for Wealth. We have other organizations that we're working on. We have actually other organizations worldwide that are adopting Aladdin for Wealth. And so it is through technology that is advancing our positioning with our wires. It is trying to work with them on ETF strategies. But I actually believe the relationships that we have with the wires now are more comprehensive, more holistic than any time ever. And we believe, like we just said -- as I said, this -- last week was when we went live with Morgan Stanley, we believe through those processes, we're going to start seeing in maybe the fourth quarter in 2019, increased flows through our holistic relationships with our wires of all our strategic partners. The other area where you're seeing, especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons why we believe over the next 5 years, ETFs will double in size, is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consultive relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products. And so we believe over time, we're getting ourselves better positioned to have deeper, more holistic relationships, and we continue to believe that is what's going to be driving our future growth."

Or do you think your active fixed income products can take a large share of that? And then maybe just a little bit more color on the Lloyds arrangement with the $40 billion. Is that just a part that's coming more quickly? And I think you're in a strategic partnership with them for a potential of a few -- GBP 100 million."

Now that the market's resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure has only moved, I don't know, on the year, 30 basis points, so it's not a significant move. But net-net, you're going to see more and more pension funds using, as you raised, LDI. We're seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDIs. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter, and it continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We'll see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year. But we do believe the trend will be over the long term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans as more and more money is now moving into high contribution, so it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don't describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a GBP 30 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives where we believe we're going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform. We are looking at -- they're looking at utilization of our Aladdin platform and other forms of technology. So it's a comprehensive relationship. It is deep and related to the other pool of assets. We'll see -- I mean, we'll see about that outcome."

And again, we've tried to give you a little bit more visibility through some better disclosure, both in the press release and the Q. But there's a portion of that, that is more professional fee-related, as I mentioned, about $13 million tied to closing a number of transactions that clearly will come out. The contingent purchase price adjustments is going to be a part of our P&L for some period of time. We have about 250-plus million dollars of contingent purchase price liability on our balance sheet. We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is, when it goes up, it creates some noise in our G&A line. The good news is, when it goes up, it means the deals we have done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the First Reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in coming quarters has gone up, which is why we are at fair value in that. So we will do as best we can to call that out for you so that you can see some of that volatility in what we would consider kind of more nonrecurring core G&A expense. In terms of expectations for the fourth quarter, I think you've got it right on. I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component, that kind of is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years is that our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter. And you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment, look, I think for us, we have purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client-centric solution to our clients. And we've seen typical markets before, but we think that our unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately in our display, whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we've done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that's really the hard part. But we think we've got a model advantage. And so our intent is to continue to invest through the cycle on behalf of our clients and our shareholders."
