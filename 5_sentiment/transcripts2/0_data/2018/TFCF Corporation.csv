It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our new plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan. We firmly believe these transactions will unlock the full value of our iconic brands and better position all of our businesses to compete in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape. But until the Disney deal closes sometime next year, we remain wholly focused on executing against the same growth strategies that made these transactions possible in the first place. Which brings us to the second fiscal quarter, where we deliver top line growth of 5% despite difficult comps, driven largely by double-digit growth at both our domestic and international cable network businesses. Importantly, this was underpinned by continued acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue. We drove a 12% year-over-year increase sequentially surpassing the 11% gain of the prior quarter. Our strategy has made a power growth through careful but steady investment in our core brands where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sports and entertainment businesses. 
Integral to the strategy is live sport. In fact, live sport has never been more important than it is today. This is why we are energized and excited about our recent agreement with the NFL to make FOX Sports the official home of Thursday Night Football for the next 5 years. NFL programming is hands-down the most powerful in all of media. And if you look at our decades long relationship with the league, I think you'll agree, having the most important sports rights over a longer term has always served us well. This new agreement joins our Sunday afternoon package with Thursday nights to concentrate America's football on Fox. This concentration affords us great monetization opportunities, including through our new expanded digital rights and creates a clear runway to further grow the value of our broadcast business, all key goals as we think about setting up a New Fox for the future. 
Broadly, this past fall, FOX Sports dominated viewership was 34% more live sports viewing than its next closest competitor. It achieved the goal it set at last year's upfront to be the #1 network in total football viewing and own the fall. For calendar year 2017, FOX Sports delivered a 21% gain over calendar 2016. Fox Sports entered 2018 as the leader in the most valuable type of programming, the leader in America's most popular sport and the dominant brand during the most valuable time of the year. Over news, Fox News closed calendar 2017 with its highest rated year ever, its second consecutive year as the most watched network on basic cable. Primetime changes drove growth in audience share across all key demographics. Likewise, FOXBusiness achieved its highest rated year ever in both total day and business day, beating CNBC in business day viewership. Turning to entertainment, where we continue to strengthen our output, we are creating new hits to drive even deeper audience engagement Fox Broadcasting has 4 of the top 5 new dramas of the season as well as 2 of the top 3 new comedies. In addition, our midseason is off to a promising start with the brilliant 911, a clear stand out. Cut to entertainment program has always been a critical part of SBC's lineup and that will not change with the New Fox. At our Film studio, the great work of our colleagues and creative partners was recognized with industry-leading 27 Academy award nominations. This is on top of more Golden Globe wins than any of our peers, showing the breadth and reach of our creative prowess, fueled by The Shape of Water, 3 billboards and The Greatest Showman. And we have a great sleight this calendar year with Deadpool 2 set for release in May, Battle Angel at Aleta in the summer and the next installment of the X-Men franchises, Dark Phoenix, set for later in the year. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our near-term growth plans while successfully completing our value-enhancing transactions. 
And with that, I'll hand over to John."

Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong do",775,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong double-digit affiliate fee increases at the cable networks, partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Television segment. Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.44 billion was down 28% from last year. On an individual segment basis, increased cable segment contributions were more than offset by the expected impact of difficult comparisons at the Television segment and lower film entertainment results. From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.84 billion or $0.99 per share increased from the $0.46 per share reported in the prior year, and this is primarily due to a $1.3 billion or $0.72 per share benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Job acts. Our adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.42 versus a comparable $0.53 in the prior year. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, the cable network segment reported EBITDA of $1.37 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Revenue growth of 11% was partially offset by a 15% increase in expenses from the higher volume of sporting events led by the earlier start of the NBA season at the RSNs, the timing of Cricket matches at STAR, the new Big Ten collegiate events as FS1 and new sublicensed sports product. This quarter's sublicensing had a 2 percentage point impact on revenue growth and a 3 percentage point impact on expense growth with no significant effect on earnings. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 10%, led by 12% affiliate fee growth, reflecting higher average rates across all of our domestic brands, led by national sports and news channels. Domestic advertising declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of lower general entertainment ratings from fewer hours of originals at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 1% over the prior year with a higher affiliate revenue mostly offset by the increased sports costs from the timing and volume of gains at the RSNs and the national sports channels. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 15%, with a 13% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 14% increase in reported advertising revenue. International content and other revenues increased 30% due to the sublicensing of Latin American Soccer rights, which is fully offset in expenses. Reported international EBITDA contributions were up 8% from the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues being partially offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from the earlier timing of BCCI Cricket matches at STAR in India. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $56 million, 85% below last year. Revenues declined 6% as continued retransmission consent revenue growth was more than offset by expected advertising revenue declines, reflecting challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included local political revenues from the general election and the highest viewership for a World Series in over 2 decades as well as last year's incremental spectrum use revenue in one of our local TV markets. Also contributing to the revenue decline were the effects of lower NFL ratings, which were more than offset by the addition of college football on the network. Television segment expenses increased over the prior year, reflecting an increased volume of college and NFL football and MLB baseball games combined with normal contractual increases. 
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $131 million was $258 million below last year. This quarter included significant re-leasing costs for our holiday movie slate, including The Greatest Showman and Ferdinand as well as prerelease costs for Maze Runner. In all, we released 8 films in the quarter, 5 of which are Academy Award nominees compared to a much lighter released slate last year. 
Now from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and $98 billion -- $19.8 billion in debt. And our capital allocation priority remains focused on the Sky acquisition. And finally, just a comment on tax. Because we have a June fiscal year, the impact of the U.S. tax act will blend in over 2 fiscal years. In this current fiscal year, our U.S. statutory rate will decline to a full year average of 28%. And then, beginning at the -- at next fiscal year, it will decline to the new 21% rate. At this point, we're expecting our normalized effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the mid 20% range. 
With that, let me turn it over to James."

In the first half of fiscal 2018, as you've seen, we've made of considerable progress. Our programming from scripted to nonfiction, sports and news continues to differentiate and fortify these brands. And our customers experience continues to improve as well. Our strategy of making our content more available, not less, is paying dividends, and we're driving more flexibility, more access both in and outside the home and a better advertising experience across the board. IP delivery of entertainment is driving a better environment for the business, and we are making strides. I want to highlight just a few advances. As of today, we are approaching 4 million Digital MVPD subscribers even as we're still in the early innings. Many of these services have yet to roll out distribution and marketing to important cities throughout the U.S. The growing subscriber contributions from these new entrants, which reflects 50% sequential growth from the September to December quarters, offset declines in the traditional distribution marketplace, maintaining our domestic subscriber levels. Our affiliate, Hulu, recently announced strong growth as well, crossing 17 million subscribers and notably adding more United States subscribers than Netflix in both of the last 2 quarters. Along with strong first half results as well, Sky recently announced streaming plans for key markets in Europe, developing cost-efficient platforms to extend the Sky Q and streaming businesses without the need of satellite DISH, driving growth opportunities in both existing and new markets. Let me update you on our proposed transactions, starting with Sky, which has moved forward to the next phase of the regulatory review progress. With the recent publication and provisional findings by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, we continue to engage constructively with the CMA to address their concerns ahead of their May 1 final report. We anticipate regulatory approval for our proposed Sky transaction by the end of June, as we've said earlier. And finally, on the New Fox and Disney, we are currently engaged in the planning process for the separation of the businesses with a view toward the integration of our assets at Disney and the establishment of the New Fox. We are convinced that the creation of these 2 dynamic media companies will set a path forward for our business us to thrive and realize their full potential and for our shareholders to benefit from compelling growth opportunities. 
In summary, we're continuing to make operational advances that bolster our competitive footing and position us for long-term growth. So with that, I think we'll go to your questions, Reed."

The -- on the NFL, I think we've been -- I think Lachlan put it well in his opening comments we're really concentrating the NFL audience and NFL products on the FOX Network. I think it is very attractive. I think when you look at the licensing that the NFL has undertaken, with expanding the Thursday night, and we've talked in the past about what fragmentation can do to the overall -- audience of each individual day, we the right answer there is really to concentrate that audience and to have Fox really be the clear leader in NFL broadcasting with the product as powerful as it is. So we think that's pretty attractive to have the extra night of football and it's a powerful platform for the network, both in terms of other promotions and promoting other nights and other programs. But in general, it's a scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise. We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product. 
And then with respect to the digital rights, I think just in summary, the new agreement gives us much more flexibility in terms of exploiting those rights, some of which on a nonexistent basis. Others definitely gives us more flexibility to explore the rights and bring the product to our customers in new ways, both on a direct-to-consumer basis and over-the-top and on new devices."

And we've already seen sort of good momentum behind the network. I think we finished January as the #1 network on Television. We're the only network with growth of about 15% growth in January. We liked our fall launches and our midseason. Our shows, obviously, I mentioned, are 911 and also the 4 has been a good reality show for us.

So I think around the world, we look at sports rights as something pretty straightforward, we just have to make judgment calls in each option, in each situation and with each package of rights that come up. And that can be from the IPL in India, which we are commencing broadcasting for the first time this year, to Soccer and European football rights to the NFL or baseball here. So each time you have to look at it and think about the overall balance of investment and how you go forward. I think with respect to the overall fragmentation of viewing kind of generally, I think the value of a concentrated audience is very high, even if the absolute number of viewers may be a little bit lower as the fragmentation impacts, the scarcity value of those events is tremendous. And advertisers are -- remain very attracted to that. So we think it's an important part of the portfolio, but you would never make a blanket assumption about prices, about which events and what you're doing going forward because you have to look at it on a case by case basis. As you've seen in the past where we've walked away from things, waited until the structure of a package was just right.

So we're focused on those things very much. But until we get there, we're very much operating this business at a very -- at a high velocity. And in a mode around building each business and each brand as best we can as we would have anyway. So I think ahead of closing, you have to operate on a business as usual, basis, and you have to try to make the right decisions for each business and each man there. So for example, we continue to build our capabilities and direct to consumer. We've revamped all of our major over-the-top apps in the United States and, in some cases, outside with Fox Plus in Latin America and, for example, NatGeo 1 which launched in Australia recently. So we continue to push the pace on that. And I think as we get closer to closing, right and the separation, then you have to establish the kind of right path for each different chunk. But in the meantime, I think we just continue to go. We're seeing really good progress, great customer numbers there, really great customer engagement. As I mentioned, my comments the customer experience just gets better and better as we've invested in this capability in rolling out new features and new upgrades to all of those things. So we continue to do that. And with respect to other sorts of opportunities, you mentioned stations, et cetera, we have to be open-minded and do the right thing for the long-term value in the business. And none of the pending transactions change that. We think we are on a pretty good course and we'll continue to be."

They don't really compete with the rest, so it's as a standalone business driving audience and driving engagement there, we continue to think it's a very attractive business, and that's why it was a very attractive opportunity to include those in the merger with Disney.

And I don't -- doesn't really matter who's bidding. People have to make economic choices around the value of these rights, the value of these products. So we like our ability to compete across the board with these brands with a variety and the diversity of rights that I think we've proven ourselves in terms of being able to put together really compelling packages there, but it's never a question of all or nothing.

But we actually feel reasonably good about it and I think actually the promise of streaming environment is 1 there -- or even in linear broadcasting on sports, for example, having a nonlinear, very data-driven advertising platform seeing it underneath that and being able to monetize that audience is hugely attractive. And we see that starting to bear fruit, but it's still not an enormous part of the audience that's consuming nonlinear product on digital streaming prop Florence. So that something that as that grows, we think that the yields from a minute by minute, customer by customer basis will continue to improve. We certainly see that, for example, in the Hulu streams, where we just have dramatically better monetization Hulu owned and operated apps than we do, for example, on the traditional MVPD distribution, which is some -- is encouraging in terms of leveling off and equalizing over the next number of years, which we think is very possible."

It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan.",695,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan. We firmly believe these transactions will unlock the full value of our iconic brands and better position all of our businesses to compete in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape. But until the Disney deal closes sometime next year, we remain wholly focused on executing against the same growth strategies that made these transactions possible in the first place. Which brings us to the second fiscal quarter where we deliver top line growth of 5% despite difficult comps, driven largely by double-digit growth at both our domestic and international cable network businesses. Importantly, this was underpinned by continued acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue. We drove a 12% year-over-year increase, sequentially surpassing the 11% gain of the prior quarter. Our strategy has made a power [indiscernible] growth through careful but steady investment in our core brands where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sport and entertainment businesses.
Integral to the strategy is live sport. In fact, live sport has never been more important than it is today. This is why we are energized and excited about our recent agreement with the NFL to make FOX Sports the official home of Thursday Night Football for the next 5 years. NFL programming is hands-down the most powerful in all of media. And if you look at our decades-long relationship with the league, I think you'll agree, having the most important sports rights over a longer term has always served us well.
This new agreement joins our Sunday afternoon package with Thursday nights to concentrate America's football on Fox. This concentration affords us great monetization opportunities, including through our new expanded digital rights, and creates a clear runway to further grow the value of our broadcast business, all key goals as we think about setting up the New Fox for the future.
Broadly, this past fall, FOX Sports dominated viewership with 34% more live sports viewing than its next closest competitor. It achieved the goal it set at last year's upfront to be the #1 network in total football viewing and owned the fall. For calendar year 2017, FOX Sports delivered a 21% gain over calendar 2016. Fox Sports enters 2018 as the leader in the most valuable type of programming, the leader in America's most popular sport and the dominant brand during the most valuable time of the year.
Over on news. Fox News closed calendar 2017 with its highest rated year ever, its second consecutive year as the most watched network on basic cable. Primetime changes drove growth in audience share across all key demographics. Likewise, FOX Business achieved its highest rated year ever in both total day and business day, beating CNBC in business day viewership.
Turning to entertainment, where we continue to strengthen our output, we are creating new hits to drive even deeper audience engagement. Fox Broadcasting has 4 of the top 5 new dramas of the season as well as 2 of the top 3 new comedies. In addition, our mid-season is off to a promising start with the brilliant 911, a clear standout.  Cut-through entertainment programming has always been a critical part of FBC's lineup, and that will not change with the New Fox.
At our film studio, the great work of our colleagues and creative partners was recognized with industry-leading 27 Academy Award nominations. This is on top of more Golden Globe wins than any of our peers, showing the breadth and reach of our creative prowess, fueled by The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and The Greatest Showman. And we have a great slate this calendar year, with Deadpool 2 set for release in May, Battle Angel Alita in the summer and the next installment of the X-Men franchises, Dark Phoenix, set for later in the year. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our near-term growth plans while successfully completing our value-enhancing transactions.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."
91031,550955607,1382934,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-07,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong d",768,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong double-digit affiliate fee increases at the cable networks, partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Television segment.
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.44 billion was down 28% from last year. On an individual segment basis, increased Cable segment contributions were more than offset by the expected impact of difficult comparisons at the Television segment and lower Filmed Entertainment results.
From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.84 billion or $0.99 per share increased from the $0.46 per share reported in the prior year, and this is primarily due to a $1.3 billion or $0.72 per share benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts. Our adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.42 versus a comparable $0.53 in the prior year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.37 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Revenue growth of 11% was partially offset by a 15% increase in expenses from a higher volume of sporting events, led by the earlier start of the NBA season at the RSNs, the timing of cricket matches at STAR, the new Big Ten collegiate events at FS1 and new sublicensed sports product. This quarter's sublicensing had a 2 percentage point impact on revenue growth and a 3 percentage point impact on expense growth with no significant effect on earnings.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10%, led by 12% affiliate fee growth, reflecting higher average rates across all of our domestic brands, led by national sports and news channels. Domestic advertising declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of lower general entertainment ratings from fewer hours of originals at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 1% over the prior year, with the higher affiliate revenue mostly offset by the increased sports costs from the timing and volume of gains at the RSNs and the national sports channels.
Reported international cable revenues grew 15% with a 13% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 14% increase in reported advertising revenue. International content and other revenues increased 30% due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights, which is fully offset in expenses. Reported international EBITDA contributions were up 8% from the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, being partially offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from the earlier timing of BCCI cricket matches at STAR in India.
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $56 million, 85% below last year. Revenues declined 6% as continued retransmission consent revenue growth was more than offset by expected advertising revenue declines, reflecting challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included local political revenues from the general election and the highest viewership for a World Series in over 2 decades as well as last year's incremental spectrum use revenue in one of our local TV markets.
Also contributing to the revenue decline were the effects of lower NFL ratings, which were more than offset by the addition of college football on the network. Television segment expenses increased over the prior year, reflecting an increased volume of college and NFL football and MLB baseball games combined with normal contractual increases.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $131 million was $258 million below last year. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our holiday movie slate, including The Greatest Showman and Ferdinand as well as prerelease costs for Maze Runner. In all, we released 8 films in the quarter, 5 of which are Academy Award nominees, compared to a much lighter release slate last year.
Now from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. And our capital allocation priority remains focused on the Sky acquisition.
And finally, just a comment on tax. Because we have a June fiscal year, the impact of the U.S. tax act will blend in over 2 fiscal years. In this current fiscal year, our U.S. statutory rate will decline to a full year average of 28%. And then beginning at next fiscal year, it will decline to the new 21% rate. At this point, we're expecting our normalized effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the mid-20% range.
With that, let me turn it over to James."

In the first half of fiscal 2018, as you've seen, we made really considerable progress. Our programming, I think, from scripted to nonfiction, sports and news continues to differentiate and fortify these brands. And our customers' experience continues to improve as well. Our strategy of making our content more available, not less, is paying dividends, and we're driving more flexibility, more access both in and outside the home and a better advertising experience across the board. IP delivery of entertainment is driving a better environment for the business, and we are making strides. I want to highlight just a few advances.
As of today, we are approaching 4 million Digital MVPD subscribers even if we're still in the very early innings. Many of these services have yet to roll out distribution and marketing to important cities throughout the U.S. The growing subscriber contributions from these new entrants, which reflects 50% sequential growth from the September to December quarters, offset declines in the traditional distribution marketplace, maintaining our domestic subscriber levels. Our affiliate, Hulu, recently announced strong growth as well, crossing 17 million subscribers and, notably, adding more United States subscribers than Netflix in both of the last 2 quarters. Along with strong first half results as well, Sky recently announced streaming plans for key markets in Europe, developing cost-efficient platforms to extend the Sky Q and streaming businesses without the need of a satellite dish, driving growth opportunities in both existing and new markets.
Let me update you on our proposed transactions, starting with Sky, which has moved forward to the next phase of the regulatory review progress. With the recent publication of provisional findings by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, we'll continue to engage constructively with the CMA to address their concerns ahead of their May 1 final report. We anticipate regulatory approval for our proposed Sky transaction by the end of June, as we've said earlier.
And finally, on the New Fox and Disney, we're currently engaged in the planning process for the separation of the businesses with a view toward the integration of our assets at Disney and the establishment of the New Fox. We're convinced that the creation of these 2 dynamic media companies will set a path forward for our businesses to thrive and realize their full potential and for our shareholders to benefit from compelling growth opportunities.
In summary, we're continuing to make operational advances that bolster our competitive footing and position us for long-term growth.
So with that, I think we'll go to your questions, Reed."

The -- look, on the NFL, I think we've been -- I think Lachlan put it well in his opening comments, we're really concentrating the NFL audience and NFL products on the Fox Network because, I mean, we think it's very attractive. I think when you look at the licensing that the NFL has undertaken with expanding the Thursday night, and we've talked in the past about what fragmentation can do to the overall -- the audience of each individual day, we think the right answer there is actually to concentrate that audience and to have Fox really be the clear leader in NFL broadcasting with a product as powerful as it is. So we think that's pretty attractive to have the extra night of football, and it's a powerful platform for the network, both in terms of other promotions and promoting other nights and other programs. But in general, the scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise. We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product. And then with respect to the digital rights, I think just in summary, the new agreement gives us much more flexibility in terms of exploiting those rights, some of which on a nonexistent basis, others differently, but it gives us more flexibility to exploit the rights and really bring the product to our customers in new ways, both on a direct-to-consumer basis and over-the-top and on new devices."

And we've already seen sort of good momentum behind the network. I think we finished January as the #1 network in television. We're the only network with growth of about 15% growth in January. We liked our fall launches and our mid-season. Our shows, obviously, I mentioned, are 911 and also The Four has been a good reality show for us.

So I think around the world, we look at sports rights as something pretty straightforward. We just have to make judgment calls in each auction, in each situation and with each package of rights that come up. And that can be from the IPL in India, which we're commencing broadcasting for the first time this year, to soccer and European football rights, to the NFL or baseball here. So each time, you have to look at it and think about the overall balance of investment and how you go forward. I think with respect to the overall fragmentation of viewing kind of generally, I think the value of a concentrated audience is very high. Even if the absolute number of viewers may be a little bit lower as the fragmentation impacts, the scarcity value of those events is tremendous. And advertisers are -- remain very attracted to that. So we think it's an important part of the portfolio, but you would never make a blanket assumption about prices, about which events and what you're doing going forward because you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. As you've seen in the past where we've walked away from things or waited until the structure of a package was just right and then been more confident investing in it, and that's the way we're looking at it."

So we're focused on those things very much. But until we get there, we're very much operating this business at a very -- at a high velocity and in a mode around building each business and each brand as best we can as we would have anyway. So I think ahead of closing, you have to operate on a business as usual basis and you have to try to make the right decisions for each business and each brand there. So for example, we continue to build our capabilities in direct-to-consumer. We've revamped all of our major over-the-top apps in the United States and, in some cases, outside with Fox Plus in Latin America and, for example, Nat Geo 1, which launched in Australia recently. So we continue to push the pace on that. And I think as we get closer to closing, right, and the separation, then you have to establish the kind of glide path for each different chunk. But in the meantime, I think we just continue to go. We're seeing really good progress, great customer numbers there, really great customer engagement. As I mentioned in my comments, the customer experience just gets better and better as we've invested in this capability in rolling out new features and new upgrades to all of those things. So we continue to do that. And with respect to other sorts of opportunities, you mentioned stations, et cetera, we have to be open-minded and do the right thing for the long-term value in the business.

I think the economic performance of the RSNs has been tremendous. But also remember that they have their own set of rights, local rights. It's a very different market. They don't really compete with the rest. So it's -- as a stand-alone business driving audience and driving engagement there, we continue to think it's a very attractive business, and that's why we think it was a very attractive opportunity to include those in the merger with Disney. That said, the national sports market, which is pretty distinct in terms of rights, in terms of how you do it, et cetera, is one that we also believe in. As you can see, with the rapid growth of FOX Sports 1 and 2, the Big Ten Network, and we're excited about that, that's why we started FOX Sports 1 only a few years ago."

But in all of these places, it's a question really of making choices, and that's why you don't have to say -- you don't have to be all in on every set of rights and pay whatever it takes. And I don't -- it doesn't really matter who's bidding. I mean, people have to make economic choices around the value of these rights, the value of these products. So we like our ability to compete across the board with these brands with a variety and the diversity of rights that I think we've proven ourselves in terms of being able to put together really compelling packages there, but it's never a question of all or nothing. You have to make choices, and sometimes, you don't think something is worth as much as somebody else does, and you push the business in a -- or steer the business in a different direction."

The number of impressions we can deliver to advertisers is always going to be something that we have to do well or -- what we do with it. We have some pretty difficult comparisons, as John mentioned, in this year-on-year period, but we actually feel reasonably good about it. And I think, actually, the promise of streaming environment is one there -- where even in -- sort of in linear broadcasting on sports, for example, having nonlinear, really data-driven advertising platform sitting underneath that and being able to monetize that audience is hugely attractive. And we see that starting to bear fruit, but it's still not an enormous part of the audience that's consuming on linear product on digital streaming platforms. So that's something that as that grows, we think that the yields from a minute-by-minute, customer-by-customer basis will continue to improve. We certainly see that, for example, in the Hulu streams where we just have dramatically better monetization on Hulu-owned and operated apps than we do, for example, on the traditional MVPD distribution, which is something that is encouraging in terms of leveling off and equalizing those over the next number of years, which we think is very possible."

It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan.",700,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan. We firmly believe these transactions will unlock the full value of our iconic brands and better position all of our businesses to compete in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape. But until the Disney deal closes sometime next year, we remain wholly focused on executing against the same growth strategies that made these transactions possible in the first place. Which brings us to the second fiscal quarter, where we delivered top line growth of 5% despite difficult comps, driven largely by double-digit growth at both our domestic and international cable network businesses. Importantly, this was underpinned by continued acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue. We drove a 12% year-over-year increase, sequentially surpassing the 11% gain of the prior quarter. Our strategy [ has meaned to ] power affiliate fee growth through careful but steady investment in our core brands, where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sport and entertainment businesses.
Integral to the strategy is live sport. In fact, live sport has never been more important than it is today. This is why we are energized and excited about our recent agreement with the NFL to make FOX Sports the official home of Thursday Night Football for the next 5 years. NFL programming is hands-down the most powerful in all of media. And if you look at our decades-long relationship with the league, I think you'll agree, having the most important sports rights over a longer term has always served us well.
This new agreement joins our Sunday afternoon package with Thursday nights to concentrate America's football on Fox. This concentration affords us great monetization opportunities, including through our new expanded digital rights, and creates a clear runway to further grow the value of our broadcast business, all key goals as we think about setting up the New Fox for the future.
Broadly, this past fall, FOX Sports dominated viewership with 34% more live sports viewing than its next closest competitor. It achieved the goal it set at last year's upfront to be the #1 network in total football viewing and owned the fall. For calendar year 2017, FOX Sports delivered a 21% gain over calendar 2016. Fox Sports enters 2018 as the leader in the most valuable type of programming, the leader in America's most popular sport and the dominant brand during the most valuable time of the year.
Over on news. Fox News closed calendar 2017 with its highest rated year ever, its second consecutive year as the most watched network on basic cable. Primetime changes drove growth in audience share across all key demographics. Likewise, FOX Business achieved its highest rated year ever in both total day and business day, beating CNBC in business day viewership.
Turning to entertainment, where we continue to strengthen our output, we are creating new hits to drive even deeper audience engagement. Fox Broadcasting has 4 of the top 5 new dramas of the season as well as 2 of the top 3 new comedies. In addition, our mid-season is off to a promising start with the brilliant 911, a clear standout.  [ Cut-through ] entertainment programming has always been a critical part of FBC's lineup, and that will not change with the New Fox.
At our film studio, the great work of our colleagues and creative partners was recognized with industry-leading 27 Academy Award nominations. This is on top of more Golden Globe wins than any of our peers, showing the breadth and reach of our creative prowess, fueled by The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and The Greatest Showman. And we have a great slate this calendar year, with Deadpool 2 set for release in May, Battle Angel Alita in the summer and the next installment of the X-Men franchise's, Dark Phoenix, set for later in the year. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our near-term growth plans while successfully completing our value-enhancing transactions.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."

Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong d",768,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong double-digit affiliate fee increases at the cable networks, partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Television segment.
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.44 billion was down 28% from last year. On an individual segment basis, increased Cable segment contributions were more than offset by the expected impact of difficult comparisons at the Television segment and lower Filmed Entertainment results.
From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.84 billion or $0.99 per share increased from the $0.46 per share reported in the prior year, and this is primarily due to a $1.3 billion or $0.72 per share benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.42 versus a comparable $0.53 in the prior year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.37 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Revenue growth of 11% was partially offset by a 15% increase in expenses from a higher volume of sporting events, led by the earlier start of the NBA season at the RSNs, the timing of cricket matches at STAR, the new Big Ten collegiate events at FS1 and new sublicensed sports product. This quarter's sublicensing had a 2 percentage point impact on revenue growth and a 3 percentage point impact on expense growth with no significant effect on earnings.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10%, led by 12% affiliate fee growth, reflecting higher average rates across all of our domestic brands, led by national sports and news channels. Domestic advertising declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of lower general entertainment ratings from fewer hours of originals at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 1% over the prior year, with the higher affiliate revenue mostly offset by the increased sports costs from the timing and volume of gains at the RSNs and the national sports channels.
Reported international cable revenues grew 15% with a 13% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 14% increase in reported advertising revenue. International content and other revenues increased 30% due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights, which is fully offset in expenses. Reported international EBITDA contributions were up 8% from the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, being partially offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from the earlier timing of BCCI cricket matches at STAR in India.
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $56 million, 85% below last year. Revenues declined 6% as continued retransmission consent revenue growth was more than offset by expected advertising revenue declines, reflecting challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included local political revenues from the general election and the highest viewership for a World Series in over 2 decades as well as last year's incremental spectrum use revenue in one of our local TV markets.
Also contributing to the revenue decline were the effects of lower NFL ratings, which were more than offset by the addition of college football on the network. Television segment expenses increased over the prior year, reflecting an increased volume of college and NFL football and MLB baseball games combined with normal contractual increases.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $131 million was $258 million below last year. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our holiday movie slate, including The Greatest Showman and Ferdinand as well as prerelease costs for Maze Runner. In all, we released 8 films in the quarter, 5 of which are Academy Award nominees, compared to a much lighter release slate last year.
Now from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. And our capital allocation priority remains focused on the Sky acquisition.
And finally, just a comment on tax. Because we have a June fiscal year, the impact of the U.S. tax act will blend in over 2 fiscal years. In this current fiscal year, our U.S. statutory rate will decline to a full year average of 28%. And then beginning at next fiscal year, it will decline to the new 21% rate. At this point, we're expecting our normalized effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the mid-20% range.
With that, let me turn it over to James."

In the first half of fiscal 2018, as you've seen, we made really considerable progress. Our programming, I think, from scripted to nonfiction, sports and news continues to differentiate and fortify these brands. And our customers' experience continues to improve as well. Our strategy of making our content more available, not less, is paying dividends, and we're driving more flexibility, more access both in and outside the home and a better advertising experience across the board. IP delivery of entertainment is driving a better environment for the business, and we are making strides. I want to highlight just a few advances.
As of today, we are approaching 4 million Digital MVPD subscribers even if we're still in the very early innings. Many of these services have yet to roll out distribution and marketing to important cities throughout the U.S. The growing subscriber contributions from these new entrants, which reflects 50% sequential growth from the September to December quarters, offset declines in the traditional distribution marketplace, maintaining our domestic subscriber levels. Our affiliate, Hulu, recently announced strong growth as well, crossing 17 million subscribers and, notably, adding more United States subscribers than Netflix in both of the last 2 quarters. Along with strong first half results as well, Sky recently announced streaming plans for key markets in Europe, developing cost-efficient platforms to extend the Sky Q and streaming businesses without the need of a satellite dish, driving growth opportunities in both existing and new markets.
Let me update you on our proposed transactions, starting with Sky, which has moved forward to the next phase of the regulatory review progress. With the recent publication of provisional findings by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, we'll continue to engage constructively with the CMA to address their concerns ahead of their May 1 final report. We anticipate regulatory approval for our proposed Sky transaction by the end of June, as we've said earlier.
And finally, on the New Fox and Disney, we're currently engaged in the planning process for the separation of the businesses with a view toward the integration of our assets at Disney and the establishment of the New Fox. We're convinced that the creation of these 2 dynamic media companies will set a path forward for our businesses to thrive and realize their full potential and for our shareholders to benefit from compelling growth opportunities.
In summary, we're continuing to make operational advances that bolster our competitive footing and position us for long-term growth.
So with that, I think we'll go to your questions, Reed."

I think when you look at the licensing that the NFL has undertaken with expanding to Thursday night, and we've talked in the past about what fragmentation can do to the overall -- the audience of each individual day, we think the right answer there is actually to concentrate that audience and to have Fox really be the clear leader in NFL broadcasting with a product as powerful as it is. So we think that's pretty attractive to have the extra night of football, and it's a powerful platform for the network, both in terms of other promotions and promoting other nights and other programs. But in general, the scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise. We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product. And then with respect to the digital rights, I think just in summary, the new agreement gives us much more flexibility in terms of exploiting those rights, some of which on a [ non-assisted ] basis, others differently, but it gives us more flexibility to exploit the rights and really bring the product to our customers in new ways, both on a direct-to-consumer basis and over-the-top and on new devices."

With the NFL, well, I think I said -- I might have said in my prepared comments that we have 3 of the 5 top sort of shows on United States television with the addition of the Thursday Night Football. We think that consolidating Thursday Night Football under one network as opposed to 2 gives us a great opportunity to actually grow the ratings of Thursday Night Football. And we've already seen sort of good momentum behind the network. I think we finished January as the #1 network in television. We're the only network with growth of about 15% growth in January. We liked our fall launches and our mid-season. Our shows, obviously, I mentioned, are 911 and also The Four has been a good reality show for us. So we actually feel we've got momentum, and the addition of Thursday Night Football will strengthen that as well."

So I think around the world, we look at sports rights as something pretty straightforward. We just have to make judgment calls in each auction, in each situation and with each package of rights that come up. And that can be from the IPL in India, which we're commencing broadcasting for the first time this year, to soccer and European football rights, to the NFL or baseball here. So each time, you have to look at it and think about the overall balance of investment and how you go forward. I think with respect to the overall fragmentation of viewing kind of generally, I think the value of a concentrated audience is very high. Even if the absolute number of viewers may be a little bit lower as the fragmentation impacts, the scarcity value of those events is tremendous. And advertisers are -- remain very attracted to that. So we think it's an important part of the portfolio, but you would never make a blanket assumption about prices, about which events and what you're doing going forward because you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. As you've seen in the past where we've walked away from things or waited until the structure of a package was just right and then been more confident investing in it, and that's the way we're looking at it."

But until we get there, we're very much operating this business at a very -- at a high velocity and in a mode around building each business and each brand as best we can, as we would have anyway. So I think ahead of closing, you have to operate on a business-as-usual basis and you have to try to make the right decisions for each business and each brand there. So for example, we continue to build our capabilities in direct-to-consumer. We've revamped all of our major over-the-top apps in the United States and, in some cases, outside with Fox Plus in Latin America and, for example, Nat Geo 1, which launched in Australia recently. So we continue to push the pace on that. And I think as we get closer to closing, right, and the separation, then you have to establish the kind of glide path for each different chunk. But in the meantime, I think we just continue to build. We're seeing really good progress, great customer numbers there, really great customer engagement. As I mentioned in my comments, the customer experience just gets better and better as we've invested in this capability and rolling out new features and new upgrades to all of those things. So we continue to do that. And with respect to other sorts of opportunities, you mentioned stations, et cetera, we have to be open-minded and do the right thing for the long-term value in the business.

Look, it depends on how you value New Fox to answer this question. But in my own mind, the tax liability that will result from the spin of New Fox is somewhere in the plus or minus zone now, with tax reform in, of $6 billion. And remember, there is always, as part of the deal, a minimum debt level at New Fox of $6.5 billion. So as a result, I think you should assume we will be making a minimum distribution, and the spread between the tax and the debt is accomplished -- or compensated for by an adjustment to the exchange ratio. So -- and every -- look, you pick a point on what you think the equity trading value is. For every dollar that, that market value moves one way or another, it's about $425 million of cash tax."

There's always going to be something that we have to -- we'll either do well or [indiscernible] with it. We have some pretty difficult comparisons, as John mentioned, in this year-on-year period, but we actually feel reasonably good about it. And I think, actually, the promise of a streaming environment is one there -- where even in -- sort of in linear broadcasting on sports, for example, having nonlinear, really data-driven advertising platforms sitting underneath that and being able to monetize that audience is hugely attractive. And we see that starting to bear fruit, but it's still not an enormous part of the audience that's consuming on -- linear product on digital streaming platforms. So that's something that as that grows, we think that the yields from a minute-by-minute, customer-by-customer basis will continue to improve. We certainly see that, for example, in the Hulu streams where we just have dramatically better monetization on Hulu-owned and operated apps than we do, for example, on the traditional MVPD distribution, which is something that is encouraging in terms of leveling up and equalizing those over the next number of years, which we think is very possible."

It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan.",700,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan. We firmly believe these transactions will unlock the full value of our iconic brands and better position all of our businesses to compete in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape. But until the Disney deal closes sometime next year, we remain wholly focused on executing against the same growth strategies that made these transactions possible in the first place. Which brings us to the second fiscal quarter, where we delivered top line growth of 5% despite difficult comps, driven largely by double-digit growth at both our domestic and international cable network businesses. Importantly, this was underpinned by continued acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue. We drove a 12% year-over-year increase, sequentially surpassing the 11% gain of the prior quarter. Our strategy [ has meaned to ] power affiliate fee growth through careful but steady investment in our core brands, where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sport and entertainment businesses.
Integral to the strategy is live sport. In fact, live sport has never been more important than it is today. This is why we are energized and excited about our recent agreement with the NFL to make FOX Sports the official home of Thursday Night Football for the next 5 years. NFL programming is hands-down the most powerful in all of media. And if you look at our decades-long relationship with the league, I think you'll agree, having the most important sports rights over a longer term has always served us well.
This new agreement joins our Sunday afternoon package with Thursday nights to concentrate America's football on Fox. This concentration affords us great monetization opportunities, including through our new expanded digital rights, and creates a clear runway to further grow the value of our broadcast business, all key goals as we think about setting up the New Fox for the future.
Broadly, this past fall, FOX Sports dominated viewership with 34% more live sports viewing than its next closest competitor. It achieved the goal it set at last year's upfront to be the #1 network in total football viewing and owned the fall. For calendar year 2017, FOX Sports delivered a 21% gain over calendar 2016. Fox Sports enters 2018 as the leader in the most valuable type of programming, the leader in America's most popular sport and the dominant brand during the most valuable time of the year.
Over on news. Fox News closed calendar 2017 with its highest rated year ever, its second consecutive year as the most watched network on basic cable. Primetime changes drove growth in audience share across all key demographics. Likewise, FOX Business achieved its highest rated year ever in both total day and business day, beating CNBC in business day viewership.
Turning to entertainment, where we continue to strengthen our output, we are creating new hits to drive even deeper audience engagement. Fox Broadcasting has 4 of the top 5 new dramas of the season as well as 2 of the top 3 new comedies. In addition, our mid-season is off to a promising start with the brilliant 911, a clear standout.  [ Cut-through ] entertainment programming has always been a critical part of FBC's lineup, and that will not change with the New Fox.
At our film studio, the great work of our colleagues and creative partners was recognized with industry-leading 27 Academy Award nominations. This is on top of more Golden Globe wins than any of our peers, showing the breadth and reach of our creative prowess, fueled by The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and The Greatest Showman. And we have a great slate this calendar year, with Deadpool 2 set for release in May, Battle Angel Alita in the summer and the next installment of the X-Men franchise's, Dark Phoenix, set for later in the year. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our near-term growth plans while successfully completing our value-enhancing transactions.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."
91031,550955607,1383019,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-07,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong d",768,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong double-digit affiliate fee increases at the cable networks, partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Television segment.
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.44 billion was down 28% from last year. On an individual segment basis, increased Cable segment contributions were more than offset by the expected impact of difficult comparisons at the Television segment and lower Filmed Entertainment results.
From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.84 billion or $0.99 per share increased from the $0.46 per share reported in the prior year, and this is primarily due to a $1.3 billion or $0.72 per share benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.42 versus a comparable $0.53 in the prior year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.37 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Revenue growth of 11% was partially offset by a 15% increase in expenses from a higher volume of sporting events, led by the earlier start of the NBA season at the RSNs, the timing of cricket matches at STAR, the new Big Ten collegiate events at FS1 and new sublicensed sports product. This quarter's sublicensing had a 2 percentage point impact on revenue growth and a 3 percentage point impact on expense growth with no significant effect on earnings.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10%, led by 12% affiliate fee growth, reflecting higher average rates across all of our domestic brands, led by national sports and news channels. Domestic advertising declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of lower general entertainment ratings from fewer hours of originals at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 1% over the prior year, with the higher affiliate revenue mostly offset by the increased sports costs from the timing and volume of gains at the RSNs and the national sports channels.
Reported international cable revenues grew 15% with a 13% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 14% increase in reported advertising revenue. International content and other revenues increased 30% due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights, which is fully offset in expenses. Reported international EBITDA contributions were up 8% from the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, being partially offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from the earlier timing of BCCI cricket matches at STAR in India.
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $56 million, 85% below last year. Revenues declined 6% as continued retransmission consent revenue growth was more than offset by expected advertising revenue declines, reflecting challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included local political revenues from the general election and the highest viewership for a World Series in over 2 decades as well as last year's incremental spectrum use revenue in one of our local TV markets.
Also contributing to the revenue decline were the effects of lower NFL ratings, which were more than offset by the addition of college football on the network. Television segment expenses increased over the prior year, reflecting an increased volume of college and NFL football and MLB baseball games combined with normal contractual increases.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $131 million was $258 million below last year. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our holiday movie slate, including The Greatest Showman and Ferdinand as well as prerelease costs for Maze Runner. In all, we released 8 films in the quarter, 5 of which are Academy Award nominees, compared to a much lighter release slate last year.
Now from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. And our capital allocation priority remains focused on the Sky acquisition.
And finally, just a comment on tax. Because we have a June fiscal year, the impact of the U.S. tax act will blend in over 2 fiscal years. In this current fiscal year, our U.S. statutory rate will decline to a full year average of 28%. And then beginning at next fiscal year, it will decline to the new 21% rate. At this point, we're expecting our normalized effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the mid-20% range.
With that, let me turn it over to James."

In the first half of fiscal 2018, as you've seen, we made really considerable progress. Our programming, I think, from scripted to nonfiction, sports and news continues to differentiate and fortify these brands. And our customers' experience continues to improve as well. Our strategy of making our content more available, not less, is paying dividends, and we're driving more flexibility, more access both in and outside the home and a better advertising experience across the board. IP delivery of entertainment is driving a better environment for the business, and we are making strides. I want to highlight just a few advances.
As of today, we are approaching 4 million Digital MVPD subscribers even if we're still in the very early innings. Many of these services have yet to roll out distribution and marketing to important cities throughout the U.S. The growing subscriber contributions from these new entrants, which reflects 50% sequential growth from the September to December quarters, offset declines in the traditional distribution marketplace, maintaining our domestic subscriber levels. Our affiliate, Hulu, recently announced strong growth as well, crossing 17 million subscribers and, notably, adding more United States subscribers than Netflix in both of the last 2 quarters. Along with strong first half results as well, Sky recently announced streaming plans for key markets in Europe, developing cost-efficient platforms to extend the Sky Q and streaming businesses without the need of a satellite dish, driving growth opportunities in both existing and new markets.
Let me update you on our proposed transactions, starting with Sky, which has moved forward to the next phase of the regulatory review progress. With the recent publication of provisional findings by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, we'll continue to engage constructively with the CMA to address their concerns ahead of their May 1 final report. We anticipate regulatory approval for our proposed Sky transaction by the end of June, as we've said earlier.
And finally, on the New Fox and Disney, we're currently engaged in the planning process for the separation of the businesses with a view toward the integration of our assets at Disney and the establishment of the New Fox. We're convinced that the creation of these 2 dynamic media companies will set a path forward for our businesses to thrive and realize their full potential and for our shareholders to benefit from compelling growth opportunities.
In summary, we're continuing to make operational advances that bolster our competitive footing and position us for long-term growth.
So with that, I think we'll go to your questions, Reed."

I think when you look at the licensing that the NFL has undertaken with expanding to Thursday night, and we've talked in the past about what fragmentation can do to the overall -- the audience of each individual day, we think the right answer there is actually to concentrate that audience and to have Fox really be the clear leader in NFL broadcasting with a product as powerful as it is. So we think that's pretty attractive to have the extra night of football, and it's a powerful platform for the network, both in terms of other promotions and promoting other nights and other programs. But in general, the scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise. We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product. And then with respect to the digital rights, I think just in summary, the new agreement gives us much more flexibility in terms of exploiting those rights, some of which on a [ non-assisted ] basis, others differently, but it gives us more flexibility to exploit the rights and really bring the product to our customers in new ways, both on a direct-to-consumer basis and over-the-top and on new devices."

We just have to make judgment calls in each auction, in each situation and with each package of rights that come up. And that can be from the IPL in India, which we're commencing broadcasting for the first time this year, to soccer and European football rights, to the NFL or baseball here. So each time, you have to look at it and think about the overall balance of investment and how you go forward. I think with respect to the overall fragmentation of viewing kind of generally, I think the value of a concentrated audience is very high. Even if the absolute number of viewers may be a little bit lower as the fragmentation impacts, the scarcity value of those events is tremendous. And advertisers are -- remain very attracted to that. So we think it's an important part of the portfolio, but you would never make a blanket assumption about prices, about which events and what you're doing going forward because you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. As you've seen in the past where we've walked away from things or waited until the structure of a package was just right and then been more confident investing in it, and that's the way we're looking at it."

We're very focused on closing all the transactions that we have up in the air, be it Sky in the near term and a little bit further out, the Disney transaction and the standup and separation of the New Fox. So we're focused on those things very much. But until we get there, we're very much operating this business at a very -- at a high velocity and in a mode around building each business and each brand as best we can, as we would have anyway. So I think ahead of closing, you have to operate on a business-as-usual basis and you have to try to make the right decisions for each business and each brand there. So for example, we continue to build our capabilities in direct-to-consumer. We've revamped all of our major over-the-top apps in the United States and, in some cases, outside with Fox Plus in Latin America and, for example, Nat Geo 1, which launched in Australia recently. So we continue to push the pace on that. And I think as we get closer to closing, right, and the separation, then you have to establish the kind of glide path for each different chunk. But in the meantime, I think we just continue to build. We're seeing really good progress, great customer numbers there, really great customer engagement. As I mentioned in my comments, the customer experience just gets better and better as we've invested in this capability and rolling out new features and new upgrades to all of those things. So we continue to do that. And with respect to other sorts of opportunities, you mentioned stations, et cetera, we have to be open-minded and do the right thing for the long-term value in the business. And none of the pending transactions change that. We think we're on a pretty good course, and we'll continue to be."

And I think, actually, the promise of a streaming environment is one there -- where even in -- sort of in linear broadcasting on sports, for example, having nonlinear, really data-driven advertising platforms sitting underneath that and being able to monetize that audience is hugely attractive. And we see that starting to bear fruit, but it's still not an enormous part of the audience that's consuming on -- linear product on digital streaming platforms. So that's something that as that grows, we think that the yields from a minute-by-minute, customer-by-customer basis will continue to improve. We certainly see that, for example, in the Hulu streams where we just have dramatically better monetization on Hulu-owned and operated apps than we do, for example, on the traditional MVPD distribution, which is something that is encouraging in terms of leveling up and equalizing those over the next number of years, which we think is very possible."

It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan.",700,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been nearly 2 months since we announced our plans to create a dynamic new Fox and to merge the remainder of our business with Disney. Over these past weeks, it's clear that investors are embracing our plan. We firmly believe these transactions will unlock the full value of our iconic brands and better position all of our businesses to compete in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape. But until the Disney deal closes sometime next year, we remain wholly focused on executing against the same growth strategies that made these transactions possible in the first place. Which brings us to the second fiscal quarter, where we delivered top line growth of 5% despite difficult comps, driven largely by double-digit growth at both our domestic and international cable network businesses. Importantly, this was underpinned by continued acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue. We drove a 12% year-over-year increase, sequentially surpassing the 11% gain of the prior quarter. Our strategy [ has meaned to ] power affiliate fee growth through careful but steady investment in our core brands, where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sport and entertainment businesses.
Integral to the strategy is live sport. In fact, live sport has never been more important than it is today. This is why we are energized and excited about our recent agreement with the NFL to make FOX Sports the official home of Thursday Night Football for the next 5 years. NFL programming is hands-down the most powerful in all of media. And if you look at our decades-long relationship with the league, I think you'll agree, having the most important sports rights over a longer term has always served us well.
This new agreement joins our Sunday afternoon package with Thursday nights to concentrate America's football on Fox. This concentration affords us great monetization opportunities, including through our new expanded digital rights, and creates a clear runway to further grow the value of our broadcast business, all key goals as we think about setting up the New Fox for the future.
Broadly, this past fall, FOX Sports dominated viewership with 34% more live sports viewing than its next closest competitor. It achieved the goal it set at last year's upfront to be the #1 network in total football viewing and owned the fall. For calendar year 2017, FOX Sports delivered a 21% gain over calendar 2016. Fox Sports enters 2018 as the leader in the most valuable type of programming, the leader in America's most popular sport and the dominant brand during the most valuable time of the year.
Over on news. Fox News closed calendar 2017 with its highest rated year ever, its second consecutive year as the most watched network on basic cable. Primetime changes drove growth in audience share across all key demographics. Likewise, FOX Business achieved its highest rated year ever in both total day and business day, beating CNBC in business day viewership.
Turning to entertainment, where we continue to strengthen our output, we are creating new hits to drive even deeper audience engagement. Fox Broadcasting has 4 of the top 5 new dramas of the season as well as 2 of the top 3 new comedies. In addition, our mid-season is off to a promising start with the brilliant 911, a clear standout.  [ Cut-through ] entertainment programming has always been a critical part of FBC's lineup, and that will not change with the New Fox.
At our film studio, the great work of our colleagues and creative partners was recognized with industry-leading 27 Academy Award nominations. This is on top of more Golden Globe wins than any of our peers, showing the breadth and reach of our creative prowess, fueled by The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and The Greatest Showman. And we have a great slate this calendar year, with Deadpool 2 set for release in May, Battle Angel Alita in the summer and the next installment of the X-Men franchise's, Dark Phoenix, set for later in the year. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our near-term growth plans while successfully completing our value-enhancing transactions.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."
91031,550955607,1383279,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-07,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong d",768,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported our second quarter financial results, highlighted by 5% revenue growth, resulting in over $8 billion in total revenues, a quarterly record for our current segments. This growth was driven by strong double-digit affiliate fee increases at the cable networks, partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Television segment.
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.44 billion was down 28% from last year. On an individual segment basis, increased Cable segment contributions were more than offset by the expected impact of difficult comparisons at the Television segment and lower Filmed Entertainment results.
From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.84 billion or $0.99 per share increased from the $0.46 per share reported in the prior year, and this is primarily due to a $1.3 billion or $0.72 per share benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.42 versus a comparable $0.53 in the prior year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.37 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Revenue growth of 11% was partially offset by a 15% increase in expenses from a higher volume of sporting events, led by the earlier start of the NBA season at the RSNs, the timing of cricket matches at STAR, the new Big Ten collegiate events at FS1 and new sublicensed sports product. This quarter's sublicensing had a 2 percentage point impact on revenue growth and a 3 percentage point impact on expense growth with no significant effect on earnings.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10%, led by 12% affiliate fee growth, reflecting higher average rates across all of our domestic brands, led by national sports and news channels. Domestic advertising declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of lower general entertainment ratings from fewer hours of originals at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 1% over the prior year, with the higher affiliate revenue mostly offset by the increased sports costs from the timing and volume of gains at the RSNs and the national sports channels.
Reported international cable revenues grew 15% with a 13% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 14% increase in reported advertising revenue. International content and other revenues increased 30% due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights, which is fully offset in expenses. Reported international EBITDA contributions were up 8% from the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, being partially offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from the earlier timing of BCCI cricket matches at STAR in India.
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $56 million, 85% below last year. Revenues declined 6% as continued retransmission consent revenue growth was more than offset by expected advertising revenue declines, reflecting challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included local political revenues from the general election and the highest viewership for a World Series in over 2 decades as well as last year's incremental spectrum use revenue in one of our local TV markets.
Also contributing to the revenue decline were the effects of lower NFL ratings, which were more than offset by the addition of college football on the network. Television segment expenses increased over the prior year, reflecting an increased volume of college and NFL football and MLB baseball games combined with normal contractual increases.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $131 million was $258 million below last year. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our holiday movie slate, including The Greatest Showman and Ferdinand as well as prerelease costs for Maze Runner. In all, we released 8 films in the quarter, 5 of which are Academy Award nominees, compared to a much lighter release slate last year.
Now from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. And our capital allocation priority remains focused on the Sky acquisition.
And finally, just a comment on tax. Because we have a June fiscal year, the impact of the U.S. tax act will blend in over 2 fiscal years. In this current fiscal year, our U.S. statutory rate will decline to a full year average of 28%. And then beginning at next fiscal year, it will decline to the new 21% rate. At this point, we're expecting our normalized effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the mid-20% range.
With that, let me turn it over to James."

In the first half of fiscal 2018, as you've seen, we made really considerable progress. Our programming, I think, from scripted to nonfiction, sports and news continues to differentiate and fortify these brands. And our customers' experience continues to improve as well. Our strategy of making our content more available, not less, is paying dividends, and we're driving more flexibility, more access both in and outside the home and a better advertising experience across the board. IP delivery of entertainment is driving a better environment for the business, and we are making strides. I want to highlight just a few advances.
As of today, we are approaching 4 million Digital MVPD subscribers even if we're still in the very early innings. Many of these services have yet to roll out distribution and marketing to important cities throughout the U.S. The growing subscriber contributions from these new entrants, which reflects 50% sequential growth from the September to December quarters, offset declines in the traditional distribution marketplace, maintaining our domestic subscriber levels. Our affiliate, Hulu, recently announced strong growth as well, crossing 17 million subscribers and, notably, adding more United States subscribers than Netflix in both of the last 2 quarters. Along with strong first half results as well, Sky recently announced streaming plans for key markets in Europe, developing cost-efficient platforms to extend the Sky Q and streaming businesses without the need of a satellite dish, driving growth opportunities in both existing and new markets.
Let me update you on our proposed transactions, starting with Sky, which has moved forward to the next phase of the regulatory review progress. With the recent publication of provisional findings by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, we'll continue to engage constructively with the CMA to address their concerns ahead of their May 1 final report. We anticipate regulatory approval for our proposed Sky transaction by the end of June, as we've said earlier.
And finally, on the New Fox and Disney, we're currently engaged in the planning process for the separation of the businesses with a view toward the integration of our assets at Disney and the establishment of the New Fox. We're convinced that the creation of these 2 dynamic media companies will set a path forward for our businesses to thrive and realize their full potential and for our shareholders to benefit from compelling growth opportunities.
In summary, we're continuing to make operational advances that bolster our competitive footing and position us for long-term growth.
So with that, I think we'll go to your questions, Reed."

The -- look, on the NFL, I think we've been -- I think Lachlan put it well in his opening comments, we're really concentrating the NFL audience and NFL products on the Fox Network because, I mean, we think it's very attractive. I think when you look at the licensing that the NFL has undertaken with expanding to Thursday night, and we've talked in the past about what fragmentation can do to the overall -- the audience of each individual day, we think the right answer there is actually to concentrate that audience and to have Fox really be the clear leader in NFL broadcasting with a product as powerful as it is. So we think that's pretty attractive to have the extra night of football, and it's a powerful platform for the network, both in terms of other promotions and promoting other nights and other programs. But in general, the scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise. We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product. And then with respect to the digital rights, I think just in summary, the new agreement gives us much more flexibility in terms of exploiting those rights, some of which on a [ non-assisted ] basis, others differently, but it gives us more flexibility to exploit the rights and really bring the product to our customers in new ways, both on a direct-to-consumer basis and over-the-top and on new devices."

And we've already seen sort of good momentum behind the network. I think we finished January as the #1 network in television. We're the only network with growth of about 15% growth in January. We liked our fall launches and our mid-season. Our shows, obviously, I mentioned, are 911 and also The Four has been a good reality show for us. So we actually feel we've got momentum, and the addition of Thursday Night Football will strengthen that as well."

So I think around the world, we look at sports rights as something pretty straightforward. We just have to make judgment calls in each auction, in each situation and with each package of rights that come up. And that can be from the IPL in India, which we're commencing broadcasting for the first time this year, to soccer and European football rights, to the NFL or baseball here. So each time, you have to look at it and think about the overall balance of investment and how you go forward. I think with respect to the overall fragmentation of viewing kind of generally, I think the value of a concentrated audience is very high. Even if the absolute number of viewers may be a little bit lower as the fragmentation impacts, the scarcity value of those events is tremendous. And advertisers are -- remain very attracted to that. So we think it's an important part of the portfolio, but you would never make a blanket assumption about prices, about which events and what you're doing going forward because you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. As you've seen in the past where we've walked away from things or waited until the structure of a package was just right and then been more confident investing in it, and that's the way we're looking at it."

We've got regulatory approval to be obtained, and we're very focused on that. We're very focused on closing all the transactions that we have up in the air, be it Sky in the near term and a little bit further out, the Disney transaction and the standup and separation of the New Fox. So we're focused on those things very much. But until we get there, we're very much operating this business at a very -- at a high velocity and in a mode around building each business and each brand as best we can, as we would have anyway. So I think ahead of closing, you have to operate on a business-as-usual basis and you have to try to make the right decisions for each business and each brand there. So for example, we continue to build our capabilities in direct-to-consumer. We've revamped all of our major over-the-top apps in the United States and, in some cases, outside with Fox Plus in Latin America and, for example, Nat Geo 1, which launched in Australia recently. So we continue to push the pace on that. And I think as we get closer to closing, right, and the separation, then you have to establish the kind of glide path for each different chunk. But in the meantime, I think we just continue to build. We're seeing really good progress, great customer numbers there, really great customer engagement. As I mentioned in my comments, the customer experience just gets better and better as we've invested in this capability and rolling out new features and new upgrades to all of those things. So we continue to do that. And with respect to other sorts of opportunities, you mentioned stations, et cetera, we have to be open-minded and do the right thing for the long-term value in the business. And none of the pending transactions change that. We think we're on a pretty good course, and we'll continue to be."

They don't really compete with the rest. So it's -- as a stand-alone business driving audience and driving engagement there, we continue to think it's a very attractive business, and that's why we think it was a very attractive opportunity to include those in the merger with Disney.

And I think, actually, the promise of a streaming environment is one there -- where even in -- sort of in linear broadcasting on sports, for example, having nonlinear, really data-driven advertising platforms sitting underneath that and being able to monetize that audience is hugely attractive. And we see that starting to bear fruit, but it's still not an enormous part of the audience that's consuming on -- linear product on digital streaming platforms. So that's something that as that grows, we think that the yields from a minute-by-minute, customer-by-customer basis will continue to improve. We certainly see that, for example, in the Hulu streams where we just have dramatically better monetization on Hulu-owned and operated apps than we do, for example, on the traditional MVPD distribution, which is something that is encouraging in terms of leveling up and equalizing those over the next number of years, which we think is very possible."

Before giving comments on the quarter's results, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the 2 transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note, recent press reports about the potential of our further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation. And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed preliminary [indiscernible] 3 weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to refresh shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of the New Fox. 
Planning for New Fox is well underway, and we'll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company's leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments, such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of our 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL [indiscernible] football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available. 
Now let me provide some highlights on the company's performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out. First and foremost, the earnings power of our cable networks. The segment delivered 16% growth and it's highest EBITDA quarter ever. While Dom will provide more detail from the financials, much of the strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channel business. This growth reflects the strength of our video brand to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gain at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions. 
We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition and viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSNs saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well. 
We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our broadcast network, new hit 911 and the resident and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season today total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce net season schedule at our upwards presentation and we could not more excited by the lineup. 
At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, the Assassination of Jonathan Sachi and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well. Our Film CD had a great set of for the quarter with holiday releases that continue to deliver the box office, supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman, 3 Billboards and the Oscar Best Picture Winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along at the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film for fiscal quarter. 
Ultimately it is our consistent long-term investment and creative content that has propelled this company and made it unique. This quarter's results demonstrate the success of that strategy and its ability to continue to create growth and value accretion for shareholders. John?"

At that start I'll remind you that this quarter were comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA at our Television segment. That said, the current underlying trends across our businesses reflect good progress toward our financial goals as reflected in this quarter's results. 
So for this third quarter, total company revenues were $7.4 billion, down $144 million compared to a year ago. x the Super Bowl impact, revenues grew up 4% over the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our cable network segment being partially offset by lower Television segment revenues. Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.89 billion, a 2% reduction from a year ago. Included in this quarter's results is an approximate $60 million charge, which is reflected in the other segment, which reflects the modification of stock compensation expense related to the proposed Disney transaction. So absent last year's Super Bowl contribution and the stock compensation charge this year, quarterly EBITDA grew 6%, based by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results of Film segment. 
From a bottom line perspective, reported income from continuing operations attributable to the stockholders of $876 million or $0.47 per share increased from the $0.44 per share reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.49 versus a comparable $0.54 in the prior year. However, this year's adjusted results of $0.49 includes a $0.02 per share charge from that transaction-related stock comp expense I just referred to. Additionally, our share of increased Hulu losses negatively impacted this year's earnings by $0.04 per share. 
So now turning to the performance at our operating segments. The Cable Network segment's EBITDA was $1.68 billion, up 16% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 6%. Domestic cable revenues increased 10% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 10%, which was supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued subscriber growth at our expanding networks. Ad revenue increased 3%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News, partially offset by fewer episodes of original series at FX. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% over the prior year from the strong growth across our entire portfolio of brands. You should note that sub licensing of Big Ten rights this quarter increased domestic cable revenue growth by 3 percentage points and expense growth by 5 percentage points with no effect on earnings. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 9%, led by a 14% increase in affiliate revenue. International advertising revenues were about level with last year, as continued growth at STAR entertainment and the international channels were offset by the impact of substantially reduced cricket matches on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 23%, led by a more than doubling of contributions at STAR TV. 
At Television segment, EBITDA was $78 million, 59% below last year and principally reflects the absence of contributions from last year's Super Bowl. Separately, lower NFL results this year from the ad revenue impact of reduced postseason ratings and 3 fewer games than last year, were offset by higher contributions from double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth and improved entertainment results. 
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $286 million was $87 million below last year, primarily reflecting lower TV production contributions owing to a substantial increase in the number of new first year drama series delivered and their related deficits, as well as the absence of the prior year SVOD licensing of American Crime Story. Additionally, the current quarter includes a loss of approximately $20 million, supporting the release of Marvel Strike Force, the first game produced by our new mobile game studio, FoxNext. We are encouraged by this inaugural release and as we continue to build out this business, we expect the aggregated investment in support of its future growth to approximate $100 million in this fiscal year. 
At the Film studio, results were in line with last year and included the successful performance of our holiday movie Film slate carrying into the third quarter led by The Greatest Showman, 3 Billboards and The Shape of Water. And lastly, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and $20 billion in debt with our capital allocation priority remaining focused on the Sky acquisition. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress and a lot of different fronts, and we feel that the business is in very good he",567,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress and a lot of different fronts, and we feel that the business is in very good health. As Lachlan and John said, we're focused on moving all of our businesses forward, driving improvements in the viewer experience, making our content more available, not less, both inside and outside the home and pushing ourselves creatively to build long-term value with our IT while driving up the value of our overarching video brands and more importantly, creating a more engaged advertising experience. For example, over the last several months, we renewed a number of important RSN partnerships. We're readying the direct-to-consumer Fox News products and have developed a strong number of pilots and scheduling for the next broadcast season. In addition, we are making great progress internationally. In the Indian TV business, our entertainment channels achieved significant regional market share growth over the past year in 2 of the largest regions, while launching the #1 national free-to-air channel in the country, STAR [indiscernible]. Our Sports channels are growing at a fast clip, including driving massive scale of our mobile platform Hotstar, which saw its reach succeed $140 million in the month of April is currently showing more than 2.5x growth in IPO watch time over last year. Overall, Hotstar continues to thrive as the go-to-digital video platform and is now seeing 1 billion minutes of daily watch time regularly. 
To put Hotstar scale into perspective, we had 7 million concurrent live streams during a single IPO match this season which is likely the highest ever for a sporting event on a streaming service in the world. We're very comfortable that we'll hit our $500 million EBITDA target at STAR TV. We had decided, however, from the strong quarter in the year, to continue to increase our investment in Hotstar, which for the year, will be about $50 million. As we proved with the [ IPO ], leveraging standout sport strategy we demonstrated time and again that can drive strong returns for the business. And we expect no less from recent investments and other sports rights, such as the NFL Thursday Night Football or the recently acquired extension of the BCCI rights in India. 
Turning out to Sky which recently reported strong results. The group continues to see strong demand for its products and services with a continued development and rollout of Sky Q and millions of homes across the U.K., Ireland, Italy and as of this week, Germany. Now the founding shareholder of Sky, we remain committed to our bid to buy the remaining Sky shares we do not own and expect to receive U.K. regulatory approval in a month or 2. Comcast has just begun its regulatory process and we think it's very reasonable for Comcast to undergo a robust regulatory review, which could take months. The Comcast review would be appropriate given the important role of Sky and Sky News play in the U.K. media market. 
Given Comcast fit for Sky, we're considering our options with the further announcements to be made in due course. While we're obviously focused on a number of important transactions ahead of us, we are no less focused on driving all of our businesses forward. And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I think you'll know how that we always thought that the increase in downstream competition would actually expand the market and the growth in subscribers from new entrants would actually be able to drive volume and the business, while our -- increasing our ability to monetize our rates due to the strength of our brands in our investment in the content would also kind of compound and that's why you see another quarter of double-digit growth in terms of our affiliate revenue. At this point, so this is a little bit after the close of the quarter, we are over -- we were seeing over 4 million, a good bit over 4 million digital MVPD customers in that universe. And I would say from what we can tell, the cable deterioration is not as fast as the DBS in telco. Deterioration is a subscriber base and how much of that is shifting to digital MVPD and how much is new customers in the market, I think it's split. We are also seeing a lot of the so-called cord nevers acquiring really attractive bundles from the new entrants, particularly YouTube TV and Hulu Live, which continue to grow really well. So we couldn't be more excited about the affiliate universe, and I think it just goes to show the your new competition and lower barriers to entry will drive real innovation for customers and that competition can expand the overall marketplace.

In terms of the Fox News comp, I think one of the importance things to mention, as you said, the comp is difficult with when you compared to a year ago. So the first 100 days of this presidency and what were incredibly record breaking ratings. I should say, though, however, that if you look April to April, to actually just outside of this quarter we're reporting, last April was the last month where Bill O'Reilly was leading our primetime before he left the channel. And if you look April to April, we've held our ratings incredibly well. We're basically flat with last year, and I think that's a real test amount to the strength of the brand and obviously the strength of the talent on air. So we feel very strongly about that.

Before giving comments on the quarter's results, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the 2 transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note, recent press reports about the potential of a further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation.
And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed a preliminary proxy 3 weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to request shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of New Fox.
Planning for New Fox is well underway and we'll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company's leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available.
Now, let me provide some highlights on the company's performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out.
First and foremost, the earnings power of our Cable Networks. The segment delivered 16% growth and its highest EBITDA quarter ever. While John will provide more detail from the financials, much of this strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channels businesses. This growth reflects the strength of our video brands to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gains at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions.
We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News Channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition in viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSN saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well.
We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our Broadcast Network, new hits, 911 and The Resident; and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season-to-date total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce next season's schedule at our upfront presentation and we could be not more excited by the lineup.
At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, The Assassination Of Gianni Versace, and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well.
Our film studio had a great setup for the quarter with holiday releases that continued to deliver at the box office supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman; Three Billboards; and the Oscar Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along with the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film fourth fiscal quarter.
Ultimately, it is our consistent long-term investment in creative content that has propelled this company and made it unique. This quarter's results demonstrate the success of that strategy and its ability to continue to create growth and value accretion for shareholders. John?"
91031,560954407,1457435,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-09,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our T",746,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.
At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our Television segment. That said, the current underlying trends across our businesses reflect good progress toward our financial goals as reflected in this quarter's results.
So for this third quarter, total company revenues were $7.4 billion, down $144 million compared to a year ago. Ex the Super Bowl impact, revenues grew 4% over the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Network segment, being partially offset by lower Television segment revenues.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.89 billion, a 2% reduction from a year ago. Included in this quarter's results is an approximate $60 million charge, which is reflected in the Other segment, which reflects the modification of stock compensation expense related to the proposed Disney transaction. So absent last year's Super Bowl contribution and the stock compensation charge this year, quarterly EBITDA grew 6%, paced by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results of the Film segment.
From a bottom line perspective, reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $876 million or $0.47 per share increased from the $0.44 per share reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.49 versus a comparable $0.54 in the prior year. However, this year's adjusted results of $0.49 includes a $0.02 per share charge from that transaction-related stock comp expense that I just referred to. Additionally, our share of increased Hulu losses negatively impacted this year's earnings by $0.04 per share.
So now, turning to the performance at our operating segments. Cable Network segment's EBITDA was $1.68 billion, up 16%, on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 6%. Domestic cable revenues increased 10% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 10%, which was supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued subscriber growth at our expanding networks. Ad revenue increased 3%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News, partially offset by fewer episodes of original series at FX.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% over the prior year from the strong growth across our entire portfolio of brands. You should note that sublicensing of Big Ten rights this quarter increased domestic cable revenue growth by 3 percentage points and expense growth by 5 percentage points with no effect on earnings.
Reported international cable revenues grew 9%, led by a 14% increase in affiliate revenue. International advertising revenues were about level with last year as continued growth at STAR entertainment and the international channels were offset by the impact of substantially reduced cricket matches on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 23%, led by a more than doubling of contributions at STAR TV.
In our Television segment, EBITDA was $78 million, 59% below last year and principally reflects the absence of contributions from last year's Super Bowl. Separately, lower NFL results this year from the ad revenue impact of reduced postseason ratings and 3 fewer games than last year were offset by higher contributions from double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth and improved entertainment results.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $286 million was $87 million below last year, primarily reflecting lower TV production contributions owing to a substantial increase in the number of new first year drama series delivered and their related deficits as well as the absence of the prior year SVOD licensing of American Crime Story.
Additionally, the current quarter includes a loss of approximately $20 million supporting the release of Marvel Strike Force, the first game produced by our new mobile game studio, FoxNext. We are encouraged by this inaugural release. And as we continue to build out this business, we expect the aggregate investment in support of its future growth to approximate $100 million in this fiscal year.
At the film studio, results were in line with last year and included the successful performance of our holiday movie film slate carrying into the third quarter, led by The Greatest Showman, Three Billboards and The Shape of Water.
And lastly, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and $20 billion in debt, with our capital allocation priority remaining focused on the Sky acquisition.
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good heal",567,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good health. As Lachlan and John said, we're focused on moving all of our businesses forward; driving improvements in the viewer experience; making our content more available, not less, both inside and outside the home; and pushing ourselves creatively to build long-term value with our IP while driving up the value of our overarching video brands; and, more importantly, creating a more engaged advertising experience.
For example, over the last several months, we renewed a number of important RSN partnerships. We're readying the direct-to-consumer Fox News products and have developed a strong number of pilots and scheduling for the next broadcast season. In addition, we're making great progress internationally. In the Indian TV business, our entertainment channels achieved significant regional market share growth over the past year in 2 of the largest regions while launching the #1 national free-to-air channel in the country, Star Bharat.
Our sports channels are growing at a fast clip, including driving massive scale of our mobile platform, Hotstar, which saw its reach exceed 140 million in the month of April and is currently showing more than 2.5x growth in IPL watch time over last year. Overall, Hotstar continues to thrive as the go-to digital video platform and is now seeing 1 billion minutes of daily watch time regularly. To put Hotstar's scale into perspective, we had 7 million concurrent live streams during a single IPL match this season, which is likely the highest ever for a sporting event on a streaming service in the world.
We're very comfortable that we'll hit our $500 million EBITDA target at STAR TV. We had decided, however, from the strong quarter in the year, to continue to increase our investment in Hotstar, which, for the year, will be about $50 million. As we proved with the IPL, leveraging standout sports strategy, we've demonstrated time and again that it can drive strong returns for the business. And we expect no less from recent investments in other sports rights such as the NFL's Thursday Night Football or the recently acquired extension of the BCCI rights in India.
Turning now to Sky, which recently reported strong results. The group continues to see strong demand for its products and services with the continued development and rollout of Sky Q in millions of homes across the U.K., Ireland, Italy and, as of this week, Germany.
Now, as the founding shareholder of Sky, we remain committed to our bid to buy the remaining Sky shares we do not own and expect to receive U.K. regulatory approval in a month or 2. Comcast has just begun its regulatory process and we think it's very reasonable for Comcast to undergo a robust regulatory review, which could take months. The Comcast review would be appropriate given the important role of Sky and Sky News play in the U.K. media market. Given Comcast's fit for Sky, we're considering our options, with a further announcement to be made in due course. While we're obviously focused on a number of important transactions ahead of us, we're no less focused on driving all of our businesses forward.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

That's why you see another quarter of double-digit growth in terms of our affiliate revenue.
At this point, so this is a little bit after the close of the quarter, we're over -- we were seeing over 4 million, a good bit over 4 million digital MVPD customers in that kind of universe. And I would say, from what we can tell, the cable deterioration is not as fast as the DBS in telco. Deterioration of a subscriber base and how much of that is shifting to digital MVPD and how much is new customers in the market, I think it's split.

So there's time to work on that, but we're not making any announcements of any affiliation changes today.
In terms of the Fox News comp, I think one of the importance things to mention is, as you said, the comp is difficult with -- when you compare them to a year ago, so the first 100 days of this presidency and what were incredibly record-breaking ratings. I should say though, however, that if you look April to April, so actually just outside of this quarter we're reporting, last April was the last month where Bill O'Reilly was leading our primetime before he left the channel. And if you look April to April, we've held our ratings incredibly well. We're basically flat with last year. And I think that's a real testament to the strength of the brand and, obviously, the strength of the talent on air. So we feel very strongly about that.
In terms of D2C, obviously, the advertising on the D2C platform when we launched it, we expect to be able to drive significantly higher CPMs."

Before giving comments on the quarter's results, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the 2 transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note recent press reports about the potential of a further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation.
And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed a preliminary proxy 3 weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to request shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of New Fox.
Planning for New Fox is well underway and we'll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company's leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available.
Now let me provide some highlights on the company's performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out.
First and foremost, the earnings power of our Cable Networks. This segment delivered 16% growth and its highest EBITDA quarter ever. While John will provide more detail from the financials, much of this strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channels businesses. This growth reflects the strength of our video brands to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gains at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions.
We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News Channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition in viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSN saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well.
We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our Broadcast Network, new hits, 911 and The Resident; and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season-to-date total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce next season's schedule at our upfront presentation and we could be not more excited by the lineup.
At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, The Assassination Of Gianni Versace, and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well.
Our film studio had a great setup for the quarter with holiday releases that continued to deliver at the box office supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman; Three Billboards; and the Oscar Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along with the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film fourth fiscal quarter.
Ultimately, it is our consistent long-term investment in creative content that has propelled this company and made it unique. This quarter's results demonstrate the success of that strategy and its ability to continue to create growth and value accretion for shareholders. John?"
91031,560954407,1458607,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-09,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our T",747,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.
At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our Television segment. That said, the current underlying trends across our businesses reflect good progress toward our financial goals as reflected in this quarter's results.
So for this third quarter, total company revenues were $7.4 billion, down $144 million compared to a year ago. Ex the Super Bowl impact, revenues grew 4% over the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Network segment, being partially offset by lower Television segment revenues.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.89 billion, a 2% reduction from a year ago. Included in this quarter's results is an approximate $60 million charge, which is reflected in the Other segment, which reflects the modification of stock compensation expense related to the proposed Disney transaction. So absent last year's Super Bowl contribution and the stock compensation charge this year, quarterly EBITDA grew 6%, paced by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results of the Film segment.
From a bottom line perspective, reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $876 million or $0.47 per share increased from the $0.44 per share reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.49 versus a comparable $0.54 in the prior year. However, this year's adjusted results of $0.49 includes a $0.02 per share charge from that transaction-related stock comp expense that I just referred to. Additionally, our share of increased Hulu losses negatively impacted this year's earnings by $0.04 per share.
So now turning to the performance at our operating segments. The Cable Network segment's EBITDA was $1.68 billion, up 16% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 6%. Domestic cable revenues increased 10% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 10%, which was supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued subscriber growth at our expanding networks. Ad revenue increased 3%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News, partially offset by fewer episodes of original series at FX.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% over the prior year from the strong growth across our entire portfolio of brands. You should note that sublicensing of Big Ten rights this quarter increased domestic cable revenue growth by 3 percentage points and expense growth by 5 percentage points with no effect on earnings.
Reported international cable revenues grew 9%, led by a 14% increase in affiliate revenue. International advertising revenues were about level with last year as continued growth at STAR entertainment and the international channels were offset by the impact of substantially reduced cricket matches on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 23%, led by a more than doubling of contributions at STAR TV.
In our Television segment, EBITDA was $78 million, 59% below last year and principally reflects the absence of contributions from last year's Super Bowl. Separately, lower NFL results this year from the ad revenue impact of reduced postseason ratings and 3 fewer games than last year were offset by higher contributions from double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth and improved entertainment results.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $286 million was $87 million below last year, primarily reflecting lower TV production contributions owing to a substantial increase in the number of new first year drama series delivered and their related deficits as well as the absence of the prior year SVOD licensing of American Crime Story.
Additionally, the current quarter includes a loss of approximately $20 million supporting the release of Marvel Strike Force, the first game produced by our new mobile game studio, FoxNext. We are encouraged by this inaugural release. And as we continue to build out this business, we expect the aggregate investment in support of its future growth to approximate $100 million in this fiscal year.
At the film studio, results were in line with last year and included the successful performance of our holiday movie film slate carrying into the third quarter, led by The Greatest Showman, Three Billboards and The Shape of Water.
And lastly, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and $20 billion in debt, with our capital allocation priority remaining focused on the Sky acquisition.
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good heal",567,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good health. As Lachlan and John said, we're focused on moving all of our businesses forward: driving improvements in the viewer experience; making our content more available, not less, both inside and outside the home; and pushing ourselves creatively to build long-term value with our IP while driving up the value of our overarching video brands; and, more importantly, creating a more engaged advertising experience.
For example, over the last several months, we renewed a number of important RSN partnerships. We're readying the direct-to-consumer Fox News products and have developed a strong number of pilots and scheduling for the next broadcast season. In addition, we're making great progress internationally. In the Indian TV business, our entertainment channels achieved significant regional market share growth over the past year in 2 of the largest regions while launching the #1 national free-to-air channel in the country, Star Bharat.
Our sports channels are growing at a fast clip, including driving massive scale of our mobile platform, Hotstar, which saw its reach exceed 140 million in the month of April and is currently showing more than 2.5x growth in IPL watch time over last year. Overall, Hotstar continues to thrive as the go-to digital video platform and is now seeing 1 billion minutes of daily watch time regularly. To put Hotstar's scale into perspective, we had 7 million concurrent live streams during a single IPL match this season, which is likely the highest ever for a sporting event on a streaming service in the world.
We're very comfortable that we'll hit our $500 million EBITDA target at STAR TV. We had decided, however, from the strong quarter in the year, to continue to increase our investment in Hotstar, which for the year, will be about $50 million. As we proved with the IPL, leveraging standout sports with strategy, we've demonstrated time and again that it can drive strong returns for the business. And we expect no less from recent investments in other sports rights such as the NFL's Thursday Night Football or the recently acquired extension of the BCCI rights in India.
Turning now to Sky, which recently reported strong results. The group continues to see strong demand for its products and services with the continued development and rollout of Sky Q in millions of homes across the U.K., Ireland, Italy and, as of this week, Germany.
Now as the founding shareholder of Sky, we remain committed to our bid to buy the remaining Sky shares we do not own and expect to receive U.K. regulatory approval in a month or 2. Comcast has just begun its regulatory process and we think it's very reasonable for Comcast to undergo a robust regulatory review, which could take months. The Comcast review would be appropriate given the important role Sky and Sky News play in the U.K. media market. Given Comcast's fit for Sky, we're considering our options, with a further announcement to be made in due course. While we're obviously focused on a number of important transactions ahead of us, we're no less focused on driving all of our businesses forward.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I think you will know that we always thought that the increase in downstream competition would actually expand the market and the growth in subscribers from new entrants would actually be able to drive volume in the business while our -- increasing our ability to monetize our rates due to the strength of our brands and our investment in the content would also kind of compound. That's why you see another quarter of double-digit growth in terms of our affiliate revenue.
At this point, so this is a little bit after the close of the quarter, we're over -- we were seeing over 4 million, a good bit over 4 million digital MVPD customers in that kind of universe. And I would say, from what we can tell, the cable deterioration is not as fast as the DBS in telco. Deterioration of a subscriber base and how much of that is shifting to digital MVPD and how much is new customers in the market, I think it's split. We are also seeing a lot of the so-called cord nevers, acquiring really attractive bundles from the new entrants, particularly YouTube TV and Hulu Live, which continue to grow really well. So we couldn't be more excited about the affiliate universe. And I think it just goes to show that new competition and lower barriers to entry is what drives real innovation for customers and that competition can expand the overall marketplace. We would expect it to continue."

In terms of the Fox News comp, I think one of the importance things to mention is, as you said, the comp is difficult with -- when you compare them to a year ago, so the first 100 days of this presidency and what were incredibly record-breaking ratings. I should say though, however, that if you look April to April, so actually just outside of this quarter we're reporting, last April was the last month where Bill O'Reilly was leading our primetime before he left the channel. And if you look April to April, we've held our ratings incredibly well. We're basically flat with last year. And I think that's a real testament to the strength of the brand and, obviously, the strength of the talent on air. So we feel very strongly about that.
In terms of D2C, obviously, the advertising on the D2C platform when we launched it, we expect to be able to drive significantly higher CPMs."

Before giving comments on the quarter's results, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the 2 transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note recent press reports about the potential of a further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation.
And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed a preliminary proxy 3 weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to request shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of New Fox.
Planning for New Fox is well underway and we'll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company's leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available.
Now let me provide some highlights on the company's performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out.
First and foremost, the earnings power of our Cable Networks. This segment delivered 16% growth and its highest EBITDA quarter ever. While John will provide more detail from the financials, much of this strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channels businesses. This growth reflects the strength of our video brands to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gains at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions.
We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News Channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition in viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSN saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well.
We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our Broadcast Network, new hits, 911 and The Resident; and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season-to-date total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce next season's schedule at our upfront presentation and we could be not more excited by the lineup.
At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, The Assassination Of Gianni Versace, and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well.
Our film studio had a great setup for the quarter with holiday releases that continued to deliver at the box office supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman; Three Billboards; and the Oscar Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along with the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film fourth fiscal quarter.
Ultimately, it is our consistent long-term investment in creative content that has propelled this company and made it unique. This quarter's results demonstrate the success of that strategy and its ability to continue to create growth and value accretion for shareholders. John?"
91031,560954407,1461597,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-09,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our T",747,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.
At the start, I'll remind you that this quarter, we're comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our Television segment. That said, the current underlying trends across our businesses reflect good progress toward our financial goals as reflected in this quarter's results.
So for this third quarter, total company revenues were $7.4 billion, down $144 million compared to a year ago. Ex the Super Bowl impact, revenues grew 4% over the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Network segment, being partially offset by lower Television segment revenues.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.89 billion, a 2% reduction from a year ago. Included in this quarter's results is an approximate $60 million charge, which is reflected in the Other segment, which reflects the modification of stock compensation expense related to the proposed Disney transaction. So absent last year's Super Bowl contribution and the stock compensation charge this year, quarterly EBITDA grew 6%, paced by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results of the Film segment.
From a bottom line perspective, reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $876 million or $0.47 per share increased from the $0.44 per share reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.49 versus a comparable $0.54 in the prior year. However, this year's adjusted results of $0.49 includes a $0.02 per share charge from that transaction-related stock comp expense that I just referred to. Additionally, our share of increased Hulu losses negatively impacted this year's earnings by $0.04 per share.
So now turning to the performance at our operating segments. The Cable Network segment's EBITDA was $1.68 billion, up 16% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 6%. Domestic cable revenues increased 10% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 10%, which was supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued subscriber growth at our expanding networks. Ad revenue increased 3%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News, partially offset by fewer episodes of original series at FX.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% over the prior year from the strong growth across our entire portfolio of brands. You should note that sublicensing of Big Ten rights this quarter increased domestic cable revenue growth by 3 percentage points and expense growth by 5 percentage points with no effect on earnings.
Reported international cable revenues grew 9%, led by a 14% increase in affiliate revenue. International advertising revenues were about level with last year as continued growth at STAR entertainment and the international channels were offset by the impact of substantially reduced cricket matches on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 23%, led by a more than doubling of contributions at STAR TV.
In our Television segment, EBITDA was $78 million, 59% below last year and principally reflects the absence of contributions from last year's Super Bowl. Separately, lower NFL results this year from the ad revenue impact of reduced postseason ratings and 3 fewer games than last year were offset by higher contributions from double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth and improved entertainment results.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $286 million was $87 million below last year, primarily reflecting lower TV production contributions owing to a substantial increase in the number of new first year drama series delivered and their related deficits as well as the absence of the prior year SVOD licensing of American Crime Story.
Additionally, the current quarter includes a loss of approximately $20 million supporting the release of Marvel Strike Force, the first game produced by our new mobile game studio, FoxNext. We are encouraged by this inaugural release. And as we continue to build out this business, we expect the aggregate investment in support of its future growth to approximate $100 million in this fiscal year.
At the film studio, results were in line with last year and included the successful performance of our holiday movie film slate carrying into the third quarter, led by The Greatest Showman, Three Billboards and The Shape of Water.
And lastly, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and $20 billion in debt, with our capital allocation priority remaining focused on the Sky acquisition.
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good heal",567,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
With 3 quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we've made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good health. As Lachlan and John said, we're focused on moving all of our businesses forward: driving improvements in the viewer experience; making our content more available, not less, both inside and outside the home; and pushing ourselves creatively to build long-term value with our IP while driving up the value of our overarching video brands; and, more importantly, creating a more engaged advertising experience.
For example, over the last several months, we renewed a number of important RSN partnerships. We're readying the direct-to-consumer Fox News products and have developed a strong number of pilots and scheduling for the next broadcast season. In addition, we're making great progress internationally. In the Indian TV business, our entertainment channels achieved significant regional market share growth over the past year in 2 of the largest regions while launching the #1 national free-to-air channel in the country, Star Bharat.
Our sports channels are growing at a fast clip, including driving massive scale of our mobile platform, Hotstar, which saw its reach exceed 140 million in the month of April and is currently showing more than 2.5x growth in IPL watch time over last year. Overall, Hotstar continues to thrive as the go-to digital video platform and is now seeing 1 billion minutes of daily watch time regularly. To put Hotstar's scale into perspective, we had 7 million concurrent live streams during a single IPL match this season, which is likely the highest ever for a sporting event on a streaming service in the world.
We're very comfortable that we'll hit our $500 million EBITDA target at STAR TV. We had decided, however, from the strong quarter in the year, to continue to increase our investment in Hotstar, which for the year, will be about $50 million. As we proved with the IPL, leveraging standout sports with strategy, we've demonstrated time and again that it can drive strong returns for the business. And we expect no less from recent investments in other sports rights such as the NFL's Thursday Night Football or the recently acquired extension of the BCCI rights in India.
Turning now to Sky, which recently reported strong results. The group continues to see strong demand for its products and services with the continued development and rollout of Sky Q in millions of homes across the U.K., Ireland, Italy and, as of this week, Germany.
Now as the founding shareholder of Sky, we remain committed to our bid to buy the remaining Sky shares we do not own and expect to receive U.K. regulatory approval in a month or 2. Comcast has just begun its regulatory process and we think it's very reasonable for Comcast to undergo a robust regulatory review, which could take months. The Comcast review would be appropriate given the important role Sky and Sky News play in the U.K. media market. Given Comcast's fit for Sky, we're considering our options, with a further announcement to be made in due course. While we're obviously focused on a number of important transactions ahead of us, we're no less focused on driving all of our businesses forward.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

That's why you see another quarter of double-digit growth in terms of our affiliate revenue.
At this point, so this is a little bit after the close of the quarter, we're over -- we were seeing over 4 million, a good bit over 4 million digital MVPD customers in that kind of universe. And I would say, from what we can tell, the cable deterioration is not as fast as the DBS in telco. Deterioration of a subscriber base and how much of that is shifting to digital MVPD and how much is new customers in the market, I think it's split. We are also seeing a lot of the so-called cord nevers, acquiring really attractive bundles from the new entrants, particularly YouTube TV and Hulu Live, which continue to grow really well. So we couldn't be more excited about the affiliate universe. And I think it just goes to show that new competition and lower barriers to entry is what drives real innovation for customers and that competition can expand the overall marketplace.

In terms of the Fox News comp, I think one of the importance things to mention is, as you said, the comp is difficult with -- when you compare them to a year ago, so the first 100 days of this presidency and what were incredibly record-breaking ratings. I should say though, however, that if you look April to April, so actually just outside of this quarter we're reporting, last April was the last month where Bill O'Reilly was leading our primetime before he left the channel. And if you look April to April, we've held our ratings incredibly well. We're basically flat with last year. And I think that's a real testament to the strength of the brand and, obviously, the strength of the talent on air. So we feel very strongly about that.
In terms of D2C, obviously, the advertising on the D2C platform when we launched it, we expect to be able to drive significantly higher CPMs."

Shortly, I'll provide some context on the financial results we just announced. But first, I want to update you on our pending transaction. We're making steady progress. 
Ten days ago, shareholders of both 21st Century Fox and Disney approved all proposals related to the combination of our film, television production and international businesses with Disney's exceptional assets. In addition, 21st Century Fox shareholders approved proposals necessary to affect the spin-off of our portfolio of news, sports and broadcast businesses to create the New Fox. It is pleasing to report that our shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed our recommendation of this transaction, with over 99% voting in favor. Shareholder approval is a key milestone towards the deal completing. In late June, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a consent with Disney and 21st Century Fox. We are now focused on obtaining regulatory approvals outside of the United States and on track to close our transaction in the first half of calendar 2019. 
We are confident that our businesses and brands will continue to flourish as part of Disney. As our shareholders will have meaningful ownership of the combined new company, we are focused on delivering these unique assets to Disney in great health. 
Additionally, progress in forging the New Fox as a stand-alone entity has been substantial. Anchored by the #1 news channel across of all of basic cable and the sports network that captures 40% of all NFL viewership, the New Fox will boast the schedule of America's most engaging sports news and entertainment programming. 
In particular, I want to focus on the news and live sports brands that will underpin the strategic strength and robust financial profile of the New Fox. Our cable network portfolio continues to be led by the strength of Fox News, which this quarter maintained its position as the #1 cable network. Also, the Fox Business Network achieved its highest-rated year ever this past fiscal year. In fact, the Fox Business Network beats the CNBC in the business day for the past 14 consecutive months. And Fox News has been #1 in total day and total viewers for 25 months straight. 
Equally as impressive, FOX Sports had its highest viewership ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming across the broadcast network and the cable networks, FS1 and FOX Sports 2. 
Live sports is clearly the most valuable content in our industry, and FOX Sports is the leader in live events. We are thrilled with the performance of our first FIFA Men's World Cup, which set new viewership marks for non-U.S. matches in the Group Stage Round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals, all despite the absence of the U.S. national team and a challenging time difference between Moscow and the United States. 
In addition to exceeding our financial expectations, the World Cup also vaulted FOX Sports 1 ahead of ESPN2 in total day viewership for the calendar year-to-date and puts FOX Sports 1 on track to achieve a fifth straight year of growth in total day viewership. 
Looking forward, the launch of NFL Thursday Night Football in September will enhance FOX Sports' already dominant position in television's highest-rated programming. Fox's 38 regular season NFL windows will be the most ever on a single network, and Fox will command approximately 40% of all regular-season NFL viewing. We also expect that our NFL will account for 3 of television's 5 highest-rated programming -- programs of this fall and that America's game of the week will remain TV's #1 show for a tenth consecutive season. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our momentum as we plan for and stand up the New Fox. And as we make this progress, we continue to be focused on the entire operations of 21st Century Fox while we move towards closing our transaction with Disney. 
And with that, I'll hand over to John."

Total full year revenues were $30.4 billion, up 7% over last year, led by an 11% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 10% increase in content revenue. These gains were partially offset by 3% lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the absence of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast last fiscal year. Excluding the Super Bowl, total company advertising revenues increased 2% over the prior year. 
Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.03 billion, down 2% from last year, as 10% growth at the cable segment was more than offset by both difficult comparisons of the Television segment, where the prior year included the Super Bowl, a record-breaking World Series and a national election cycle, as well as the impact of incremental investments in our direct-to-consumer and FoxNext initiatives. Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $4.5 billion this year or $2.41 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.97, 2% higher than last year. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our total company reported revenues were $7.9 billion, up 18% over last year, reflecting double digit revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $1.91 billion, a 32% increase over the $1.45 billion reported a year ago, led by higher contributions from the cable and film segment. From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was $925 million or $0.50 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 58% over last year. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Cable Networks EBITDA of $1.61 billion was up 12% on revenue growth of 14% and expense growth of 15%. Domestic cable revenues increased 9% overall, led by affiliate fees growth of 11%, supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and increased subscribers. Domestic ad revenues increased 1%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News and the impact of the FIFA Men's World Cup on FS1, partially offset by lower results at the RSNs. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from the World Cup and more original episodes at FX. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 25%, led by advertising group of 55% and a 12% increase in reported affiliate revenue. The sharp increase in ad revenues was led by the highly successful debut of the IPL tournament on STAR Sports. 
Reported international EBITDA increased 53%, led by higher contributions from both STAR Sports and its entertainment business. 
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $106 million, 23% below last year and principally reflects approximately 20% higher programming costs due to the broadcast of the Men's World Cup and higher entertainment programming expenses from increased original programming. Television segment revenues grew 14% on advertising gains of 12%, led by the broadcast of the World Cup and higher entertainment pricing and 19% higher retransmission consent revenues. 
Turning to the film segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $289 million, a $311 million improvement over last year, driven by significant film studio contributions this year from Deadpool 2 and The Greatest Showman, compared to a high level of releasing costs last year to support that higher volume of summer films. In addition, television studio contributions increased this quarter, reflecting a higher amount of content available on SVOD platforms. The growth of the studios was partially offset by further investment in the launch of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game at FoxNext. 
Now these strong overall P&L results generated over $2 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year. That's 21st Century Fox's strongest cash generation result ever. And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in cash and $19.5 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead, there were few meaningful items to note as we start our next fiscal year. At our TV segment, we will broadcast our first season of Thursday Night Football. While we expect this property to be value-accretive in the aggregate over the 5-year life of the contract, early on in the cycle, we anticipate losses as we begin to fully optimize these rights from a revenue perspective. Also at the TV segment, we'll continue to see increased retransmission growth and incremental local political advertising associated with the midterm elections. Within the cable segment, we expect to generate at least mid-single-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth for the full year. And on the cost side, you should expect an increase in international cable expenses in the fourth quarter associated with broadcasting once every 4 years the ICC Cricket World Cup at STAR. Foreign exchange is always an item to be mindful of, where we're currently seeing the U.S. dollar continuing to rise against the Indian rupee and some Latin American currencies such as the Argentine peso. Now I'll remind you that, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we're expecting our normalized effective rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the mid-20% range. 
Now to finish off, just a little housekeeping on New Fox. Our current plan is to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the late fall, which will provide historical and pro forma financial information and other details on New Fox. We will not be communicating separate financial information nor forward commentary on New Fox until that filing is cleared by the SEC. 
With that, I'll turn it over to James."

So you just heard in fiscal 2018 and particularly in our last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this",434,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and thanks for joining us today. So you just heard in fiscal 2018 and particularly in our last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this financial strength is driven by the growing value of our cable networks brands in the marketplace. We just delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit domestic affiliate growth, reflecting subscriber increases in both digital MVPD services and our younger underpenetrated channels. These gains more than offset declines in traditional subscribers. The 21st Century Fox in the U.S., we have more subscribers today than we did a year ago. And in fact, for our networks that are carried on all virtual MVPD services, revenue from subscriber additions on those services are now exceeding the revenue declines from subscriber turn on traditional platforms. And these achievements, I think, are part of the growth strategy and the business agenda we've executed against really for the better part of the decade. 
The Disney merger and separation transaction we're getting to the finish line and the value they unlock for shareholders clearly underscored this point. 
Turning back to our fiscal year. I'm particularly proud of the creative excellence and unique experiences we delivered to customers across our businesses. We're pleased with the turnaround of our film studio, which delivered a solid performance by any measure. It led the industry in awards, including the Best Picture Academy Award for Fox's Shape of Water. And on top of this, we ended the year with the box office success of Deadpool 2, which has exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts. Our television studio has 3 shows that were #1 on their respective networks and 4 of the top 10 new dramas in the broadcast season, 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted and The Resident, driving multiplatform audience growth for entertainment on the broadcast network. At STAR India, the addition of the 60-match Indian Premier League on STAR Sports has yielded dramatic results. The tournaments are almost a 30% increase in viewership over last year and the target audience on TV. Average match weeks and engagement has increased by double digits, 15% and 13%, respectively. We also saw the IPL dramatically increase viewership on our Hotstar mobile platform. To give you one data point, with 10.3 million concurrent live viewers during the IPL final match, which was the most concurrently watched live digital event in the world ever. 
So in closing, we're excited by the performance of the business and the growth we're seeing and the prospects for the future. Reed?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Shortly, I'll provide some context on the financial results we just announced, but first, I want to update you on our pending transaction. [ We're ] making steady progress.
Ten days ago, shareholders of both Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney approved all proposals related to the combination of our film, television production and international businesses with Disney's exceptional assets. In addition, Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders approved proposals necessary to effect the spinoff of our portfolio of news, sports and broadcast businesses to create the New Fox.
It is pleasing to report that our shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed our recommendation of this transaction with over 99% voting in favor. Shareholder approval is a key milestone towards the deal completing. In late June, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. We are now focused on obtaining regulatory approvals outside of the United States and on track to close our transaction in the first half of calendar 2019. 
We are confident that our businesses and brands will continue to flourish as part of Disney. As our shareholders will have meaningful ownership of the combined new company, we are focused on delivering these unique assets to Disney in great health.
Additionally, progress in forging the New Fox as a stand-alone entity has been substantial. Anchored by the #1 news channel across of all of basic cable and a sports network that captures 40% of all NFL viewership, the New Fox will boast the schedule of America's most engaging sports news and entertainment programming.
In particular, I want to focus on the news and live sports brands that will underpin the strategic strength and robust financial profile of the New Fox. Our cable network portfolio continues to be led by the strength of Fox News, which, this quarter, maintained its position as the #1 cable network. Also, the Fox Business Network achieved its highest rated year ever this past fiscal year. In fact, the Fox Business Network beats CNBC in the business day for the past 14 consecutive months, and Fox News has been #1 in total day and total viewers for 25 months straight.
Equally as impressive, FOX Sports had its highest viewership ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming across the broadcast network and the cable networks, FS1 and FOX Sports 2. Live sport is clearly the most valuable content in our industry, and FOX Sports is the leader in live events.
We are thrilled with the performance of our first FIFA Men's World Cup, which set new viewership marks for non-U.S. matches in the Group Stage round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals, all despite the absence of the U.S. national team and a challenging time difference between Moscow and the United States. In addition to exceeding our financial expectations, the World Cup also vaulted FOX Sports 1 ahead of ESPN2 in total day viewership for the calendar year-to-date and puts FOX Sports 1 on track to achieve a fifth straight year of growth in total day viewership.
Looking forward, the launch of NFL Thursday Night Football in September will enhance FOX Sports' already dominant position in television's highest rated programming. Fox' 38 regular season NFL windows will be the most ever on a single network, and Fox will command approximately 40% of all regular-season NFL viewing. We also expect that our NFL will account for 3 of television's 5 highest rated programming -- programs of this fall and that AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK will remain TV's #1 show for a 10th consecutive season.
So in summary, we are pleased with our momentum as we plan for and stand up the New Fox. And as we make this progress, we continue to be focused on the entire operations of Twenty-First Century Fox, while we move towards closing our transaction with Disney.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."

We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financ",967,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financial results for the full fiscal year, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $30.4 billion, up 7% over last year, led by an 11% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 10% increase in content revenue. These gains were partially offset by 3% lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the absence of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast last fiscal year. Excluding the Super Bowl, total company advertising revenues increased 2% over the prior year.
Total full year segment EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $7.03 billion, down 2% from last year, as 10% growth at the cable segment was more than offset by both difficult comparisons of the Television segment, where the prior year included the Super Bowl, a record-breaking World Series and a national election cycle as well as the impact of incremental investments in our direct-to-consumer and FoxNext initiatives. Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $4.5 billion this year or $2.41 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.97, 2% higher than last year.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our total company reported revenues were $7.9 billion, up 18% over last year, reflecting double-digit revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $1.91 billion, a 32% increase over the $1.45 billion reported a year ago, led by higher contributions from the cable and film segment. From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was $925 million or $0.50 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 58% over last year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Cable networks EBITDA of $1.61 billion was up 12% on revenue growth of 14% and expense growth of 15%. Domestic cable revenues increased 9% overall, led by affiliate fees growth of 11%, supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and increased subscribers. Domestic ad revenues increased 1%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News and the impact of the FIFA Men's World Cup on FS1, partially offset by lower results at the RSNs. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from the World Cup and more original episodes at FX.
Reported international cable revenues grew 25%, led by advertising growth of 55% and a 12% increase in reported affiliate revenue. The sharp increase in ad revenues was led by the highly successful debut of the IPL tournament on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 53%, led by higher contributions from both STAR Sports and its entertainment business.
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $106 million, 23% below last year and principally reflects approximately 20% higher programming costs due to the broadcast of the Men's World Cup and higher entertainment programming expenses from increased original programming. Television segment revenues grew 14% on advertising gains of 12%, led by the broadcast of the World Cup and higher entertainment pricing and 19% higher retransmission consent revenues.
Turning to the film segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $289 million, a $311 million improvement over last year driven by significant film studio contributions this year from Deadpool 2 and The Greatest Showman compared to a high level of releasing costs last year to support that higher volume of summer films. In addition, television studio contributions increased this quarter, reflecting a higher amount of content available on SVOD platforms. The growth of the studios was partially offset by further investment in the launch of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game at FoxNext.
Now these strong overall P&L results generated over $2 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year. That's Twenty-First Century Fox' strongest cash generation result ever. And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in cash and $19.5 billion in debt.
Looking ahead, there were a few meaningful items to note as we start our next fiscal year. At our TV segment, we will broadcast our first season of Thursday Night Football. While we expect this property to be value accretive in the aggregate over the 5-year life of the contract, early on in the cycle, we anticipate losses as we begin to fully optimize these rights from a revenue perspective. Also at the TV segment, we'll continue to see increased retransmission growth and incremental local political advertising associated with the midterm elections.
Within the cable segment, we expect to generate at least mid-single-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth for the full year. And on the cost side, you should expect an increase in international cable expenses in the fourth quarter associated with broadcasting once every 4 years the ICC Cricket World Cup at STAR. Foreign exchange is always an item to be mindful of, where we're currently seeing the U.S. dollar continuing to rise against the Indian rupee and some Latin American currencies such as the Argentine peso. Now I'll remind you that, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we're expecting our normalized effective rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the mid-20% range.
Now to finish off, just a little housekeeping on New Fox. Our current plan is to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the late fall, which will provide historical and pro forma financial information and other details on New Fox. We will not be communicating separate financial information nor forward commentary on New Fox until that filing is cleared by the SEC. 
With that, I'll turn it over to James."

So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in our last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this financial strength is driven by the growing value of our cable networks brands in the marketplace. We just delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, reflecting subscriber increases in both digital MVPD services and our younger underpenetrated channels. These gains more than offset declines in traditional subscribers. For Twenty-First Century Fox in the U.S., we have more subscribers today than we did a year ago. And in fact, for our networks that are carried on all virtual MVPD services, revenue from subscriber additions on those services are now exceeding revenue declines from subscriber churn on traditional platforms. And these achievements, I think, are part of a growth strategy and a business agenda we've executed against really for the better part of the decade. The Disney merger and separation transaction we're getting to the finish line and the value they unlock for shareholders clearly underscore this point. 
Turning back to our fiscal year. I'm particularly proud of the creative excellence and unique experiences we delivered to customers across our businesses. We're pleased with the turnaround of our film studio, which delivered a solid performance by any measure. It led the industry in awards, including the Best Picture Academy Award for Fox Searchlight Shape of Water, and on top of this, we ended the year with the box office success of Deadpool 2, which has exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts. Our television studio has 3 shows that were #1 on their respective networks and 4 of the top 10 new dramas of the broadcast season, 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted and The Resident, driving multi-platform audience growth for entertainment on the broadcast network.
At STAR India, the addition of the 60-match Indian Premier League on STAR Sports has yielded dramatic results. The tournaments are almost a 30% increase in viewership over last year and the target audience on TV. Average match reach and engagement has increased by double digits, 15% and 13%, respectively. We also saw the IPL dramatically increase viewership on our Hotstar mobile platform. To give you 1 data point, with 10.3 million concurrent live viewers during the IPL final match, which was the most concurrently watched live digital event in the world ever.
So in closing, we're excited by the performance of the business and the growth we're seeing and the prospects for the future. Reed?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Shortly, I'll provide some context on the financial results we just announced, but first, I want to update you on our pending transaction [ which is ] making steady progress.
Ten days ago, shareholders of both Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney approved all proposals related to the combination of our film, television production and international businesses with Disney's exceptional assets. In addition, Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders approved proposals necessary to effect the spinoff of our portfolio of news, sports and broadcast businesses to create the New Fox.
It is pleasing to report that our shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed our recommendation of this transaction, with over 99% voting in favor. Shareholder approval is a key milestone toward the deal completing. In late June, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. We are now focused on obtaining regulatory approvals outside of the United States and are on track to close our transaction in the first half of calendar 2019. 
We are confident that our businesses and brands will continue to flourish as part of Disney. As our shareholders will have meaningful ownership of the combined new company, we are focused on delivering these unique assets to Disney in great health.
Additionally, progress in forging the New Fox as a stand-alone entity has been substantial. Anchored by the #1 news channel across of all of basic cable and a sports network that captures 40% of all NFL viewership, the New Fox will boast a schedule of America's most engaging sports news and entertainment programming.
In particular, I want to focus on the news and live sports brands that will underpin the strategic strength and robust financial profile of the New Fox. Our cable network portfolio continues to be led by the strength of Fox News, which, this quarter, maintained its position as the #1 cable network. Also, the Fox Business Network achieved its highest rated year ever this past fiscal year. In fact, the Fox Business Network beat CNBC in the business day for the past 14 consecutive months, and Fox News has been #1 in total day and total viewers for 25 months straight.
Equally as impressive, FOX Sports had its highest viewership ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming across the broadcast network and the cable networks, FS1 and FOX Sports 2. Live sport is clearly the most valuable content in our industry, and FOX Sports is the leader in live events.
We are thrilled with the performance of our first FIFA Men's World Cup, which set new viewership marks for non-U.S. matches in the Group Stage round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals, all despite the absence of the U.S. national team and a challenging time difference between Moscow and the United States. In addition to exceeding our financial expectations, the World Cup also vaulted FOX Sports 1 ahead of ESPN2 in total day viewership for the calendar year-to-date and put FOX Sports 1 on track to achieve a fifth straight year of growth in total day viewership.
Looking forward, the launch of NFL Thursday Night Football in September will enhance FOX Sports' already dominant position in television's highest rated programming. Fox's 38 regular season NFL windows will be the most ever on a single network, and Fox will command approximately 40% of all regular-season NFL viewing. We also expect that our NFL will account for 3 of television's 5 highest rated programming -- programs of this fall and that AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK will remain TV's #1 show for a 10th consecutive season.
So in summary, we are pleased with our momentum as we plan for and stand up the New Fox. And as we make this progress, we continue to be focused on the entire operations of Twenty-First Century Fox, while we move towards closing our transaction with Disney.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."
91031,574658528,1539849,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financ",989,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financial results for the full fiscal year, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $30.4 billion, up 7% over last year, led by an 11% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 10% increase in content revenue. These gains were partially offset by 3% lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the absence of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast last fiscal year. Excluding the Super Bowl, total company advertising revenues increased 2% over the prior year.
Total full year segment EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $7.03 billion, down 2% from last year, as 10% growth at the cable segment was more than offset by both difficult comparisons at the Television segment, where the prior year included the Super Bowl, a record-breaking World Series and a national election cycle as well as the impact of incremental investments in our direct-to-consumer and FoxNext initiatives. Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $4.5 billion this year or $2.41 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.97, 2% higher than last year.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our total company reported revenues were $7.9 billion, up 18% over last year, reflecting double-digit revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total segment EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $1.91 billion, a 32% increase over the $1.45 billion reported a year ago, led by higher contributions from the cable and film segment. From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was $925 million or $0.50 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 58% over last year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Cable networks EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] of $1.61 billion was up 12% on revenue growth of 14% and expense growth of 15%. Domestic cable revenues increased 9% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 11%, supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and increased subscribers. Domestic ad revenues increased 1%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News and the impact of the FIFA Men's World Cup on FS1, partially offset by lower results at the RSNs. EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] at our domestic channels increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from the World Cup and more original episodes at FX.
Reported international cable revenues grew 25%, led by advertising growth of 55% and a 12% increase in reported affiliate revenue. The sharp increase in ad revenues was led by the highly successful debut of the IPL tournament on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] increased 53%, led by higher contributions from both STAR Sports and its entertainment business.
At the Television segment, EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $106 million, 23% below last year and principally reflects approximately 20% higher programming costs due to the broadcast of the Men's World Cup and higher entertainment programming expenses from increased original programming. Television segment revenues grew 14% on advertising gains of 12%, led by the broadcast of the World Cup and higher entertainment pricing and 19% higher retransmission consent revenues.
Turning to the film segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ]was $289 million, a $311 million improvement over last year driven by significant film studio contributions this year from Deadpool 2 and The Greatest Showman compared to a high level of releasing costs last year to support that higher volume of summer films. In addition, television studio contributions increased this quarter, reflecting a higher amount of content available on SVOD platforms. The growth of the studios was partially offset by further investment in the launch of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game at FoxNext.
Now these strong overall P&L results generated over $2 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year. That's Twenty-First Century Fox' strongest cash generation result ever. And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in cash and $19.5 billion in debt.
Looking ahead, there are a few meaningful items to note as we start our next fiscal year. At our TV segment, we will broadcast our first season of Thursday Night Football. While we expect this property to be value-accretive in the aggregate over the 5-year life of the contract, early on in the cycle, we anticipate losses as we begin to fully optimize these rights from a revenue perspective. Also at the TV segment, we'll continue to see increased retransmission growth and incremental local political advertising associated with the midterm elections.
Within the cable segment, we expect to generate at least mid-single-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth for the full year. And on the cost side, you should expect an increase in international cable expenses in the fourth quarter associated with broadcasting once every 4 years the ICC Cricket World Cup at STAR. Foreign exchange is always an item to be mindful of, where we're currently seeing the U.S. dollar continuing to rise against the Indian rupee and some Latin American currencies such as the Argentine peso. Now I'll remind you that, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we're expecting our normalized effective rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the mid-20% range.
Now to finish off, just a little housekeeping on New Fox. Our current plan is to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the late fall, which will provide historical and pro forma financial information and other details on New Fox. We will not be communicating separate financial information nor forward commentary on New Fox until that filing is cleared by the SEC. 
With that, I'll turn it over to James."

So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in the last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. A",439,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and thanks to you both for joining us today. So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in the last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this financial strength is driven by the growing value of our cable networks brands in the marketplace. We just delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, reflecting subscriber increases in both digital MVPD services and our younger underpenetrated channels. These gains more than offset declines in traditional subscribers. For Twenty-First Century Fox in the U.S., we have more subscribers today than we did a year ago. And in fact, for our networks that are carried on all virtual MVPD services, revenue from subscriber additions on those services are now exceeding the revenue declines from subscriber churn on traditional platforms. And these achievements, I think, are part of a growth strategy and a business agenda we've executed against really for the better part of a decade. The Disney merger and separation transaction we're getting to the finish line and the value they unlock for shareholders clearly underscore this point. 
Turning back to our fiscal year. I'm particularly proud of the creative excellence and unique experiences we deliver to customers across our businesses. We're pleased with the turnaround at our film studio, which delivered a solid performance by any measure. It led the industry in awards, including the Best Picture Academy Award for Fox Searchlight Shape of Water, and on top of this, we ended the year with the box office success of Deadpool 2, which has exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts. Our television studio has 3 shows that were #1 on their respective networks and 4 of the top 10 new dramas of the broadcast season, 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted and The Resident, driving multi-platform audience growth for entertainment on the broadcast network.
At STAR India, the addition of the 60-match Indian Premier League on STAR Sports has yielded dramatic results. The tournaments are almost a 30% increase in viewership over last year in the target audience on TV. Average match reach and engagement has increased by double digits, 15% and 13%, respectively. We also saw the IPL dramatically increase viewership on our Hotstar mobile platform. To give you 1 data point, with 10.3 million concurrent live viewers during the IPL final match, which was the most concurrently watched live digital event in the world ever.
So in closing, we're excited by the performance of the business and the growth we're seeing and the prospects for the future. Reed?"

And on Fox Network, the news and sports strategy is really clear. Can you talk a little bit about what your entertainment programming strategy is? Will you build from scratch your own program production? And will you buy? Can you talk about ad sales and the structure as you go through this transition?"

The, I think -- first of all, I think the agreements that we have for the Pay 1 window for the movie output with HBO goes well beyond our expected closing of the Disney transaction, so that's really a matter for a later day. And with respect to the television production, we have lots of partners who help us and who really create these programs. We try to find the best result for the program and the best result for us and our partners in terms of finding a home in terms of downstream licensing of that. Sometimes, that's -- the best thing to do that is in-house. Sometimes it's to seek partnership elsewhere, which we've done in some cases, where it's clearly the right strategy. So we remain flexible and open-minded around what the right thing to do with each program and with each of our partners is."

And the reason we chose to do that is really around the incredible promotional platform that gives us, not only for sport and for news but also for entertainment. And so if you look at the nights, if you think about sort of next year when we also have WWE on Friday nights, you actually have a schedule in the fall. We are only programming entertainment Monday through Wednesday and Sunday nights. And I think that gives us an incredible opportunity and honestly an incredible advantage in terms of how we can really focus our programming choices onto those nights assisted by really the country's best promotional platform in our sports lineup."

So really, the impressions that were delivered by the IPL were just so much higher than what Sony delivered with its previous ownership of it, or its previous broadcast really fell to the bottom line. So the sports business was very strong, and we're excited. I look at the lineup in terms of the overall growth of affiliate income in India.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Shortly, I'll provide some context on the financial results we just announced, but first, I want to update you on our pending transaction [ which is ] making steady progress.
Ten days ago, shareholders of both Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney approved all proposals related to the combination of our film, television production and international businesses with Disney's exceptional assets. In addition, Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders approved proposals necessary to effect the spinoff of our portfolio of news, sports and broadcast businesses to create the New Fox.
It is pleasing to report that our shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed our recommendation of this transaction, with over 99% voting in favor. Shareholder approval is a key milestone toward the deal completing. In late June, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. We are now focused on obtaining regulatory approvals outside of the United States and are on track to close our transaction in the first half of calendar 2019. 
We are confident that our businesses and brands will continue to flourish as part of Disney. As our shareholders will have meaningful ownership of the combined new company, we are focused on delivering these unique assets to Disney in great health.
Additionally, progress in forging the New Fox as a stand-alone entity has been substantial. Anchored by the #1 news channel across of all of basic cable and a sports network that captures 40% of all NFL viewership, the New Fox will boast a schedule of America's most engaging sports news and entertainment programming.
In particular, I want to focus on the news and live sports brands that will underpin the strategic strength and robust financial profile of the New Fox. Our cable network portfolio continues to be led by the strength of Fox News, which, this quarter, maintained its position as the #1 cable network. Also, the Fox Business Network achieved its highest rated year ever this past fiscal year. In fact, the Fox Business Network beat CNBC in the business day for the past 14 consecutive months, and Fox News has been #1 in total day and total viewers for 25 months straight.
Equally as impressive, FOX Sports had its highest viewership ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming across the broadcast network and the cable networks, FS1 and FOX Sports 2. Live sport is clearly the most valuable content in our industry, and FOX Sports is the leader in live events.
We are thrilled with the performance of our first FIFA Men's World Cup, which set new viewership marks for non-U.S. matches in the Group Stage round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals, all despite the absence of the U.S. national team and a challenging time difference between Moscow and the United States. In addition to exceeding our financial expectations, the World Cup also vaulted FOX Sports 1 ahead of ESPN2 in total day viewership for the calendar year-to-date and put FOX Sports 1 on track to achieve a fifth straight year of growth in total day viewership.
Looking forward, the launch of NFL Thursday Night Football in September will enhance FOX Sports' already dominant position in television's highest rated programming. Fox's 38 regular season NFL windows will be the most ever on a single network, and Fox will command approximately 40% of all regular-season NFL viewing. We also expect that our NFL will account for 3 of television's 5 highest rated programming -- programs of this fall and that AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK will remain TV's #1 show for a 10th consecutive season.
So in summary, we are pleased with our momentum as we plan for and stand up the New Fox. And as we make this progress, we continue to be focused on the entire operations of Twenty-First Century Fox, while we move towards closing our transaction with Disney.
And with that, I'll hand over to John."

We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financ",989,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I'll start with some brief comments on the financial results for the full fiscal year, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $30.4 billion, up 7% over last year, led by an 11% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 10% increase in content revenue. These gains were partially offset by 3% lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the absence of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast last fiscal year. Excluding the Super Bowl, total company advertising revenues increased 2% over the prior year.
Total full year segment EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $7.03 billion, down 2% from last year, as 10% growth at the cable segment was more than offset by both difficult comparisons at the Television segment, where the prior year included the Super Bowl, a record-breaking World Series and a national election cycle as well as the impact of incremental investments in our direct-to-consumer and FoxNext initiatives. Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $4.5 billion this year or $2.41 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.97, 2% higher than last year.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our total company reported revenues were $7.9 billion, up 18% over last year, reflecting double-digit revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total segment EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $1.91 billion, a 32% increase over the $1.45 billion reported a year ago, led by higher contributions from the cable and film segment. From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was $925 million or $0.50 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 58% over last year.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Cable networks EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] of $1.61 billion was up 12% on revenue growth of 14% and expense growth of 15%. Domestic cable revenues increased 9% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 11%, supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and increased subscribers. Domestic ad revenues increased 1%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News and the impact of the FIFA Men's World Cup on FS1, partially offset by lower results at the RSNs. EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] at our domestic channels increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from the World Cup and more original episodes at FX.
Reported international cable revenues grew 25%, led by advertising growth of 55% and a 12% increase in reported affiliate revenue. The sharp increase in ad revenues was led by the highly successful debut of the IPL tournament on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] increased 53%, led by higher contributions from both STAR Sports and its entertainment business.
At the Television segment, EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ] was $106 million, 23% below last year and principally reflects approximately 20% higher programming costs due to the broadcast of the Men's World Cup and higher entertainment programming expenses from increased original programming. Television segment revenues grew 14% on advertising gains of 12%, led by the broadcast of the World Cup and higher entertainment pricing and 19% higher retransmission consent revenues.
Turning to the film segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA (sic) [ OIBDA ]was $289 million, a $311 million improvement over last year driven by significant film studio contributions this year from Deadpool 2 and The Greatest Showman compared to a high level of releasing costs last year to support that higher volume of summer films. In addition, television studio contributions increased this quarter, reflecting a higher amount of content available on SVOD platforms. The growth of the studios was partially offset by further investment in the launch of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game at FoxNext.
Now these strong overall P&L results generated over $2 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year. That's Twenty-First Century Fox' strongest cash generation result ever. And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in cash and $19.5 billion in debt.
Looking ahead, there are a few meaningful items to note as we start our next fiscal year. At our TV segment, we will broadcast our first season of Thursday Night Football. While we expect this property to be value-accretive in the aggregate over the 5-year life of the contract, early on in the cycle, we anticipate losses as we begin to fully optimize these rights from a revenue perspective. Also at the TV segment, we'll continue to see increased retransmission growth and incremental local political advertising associated with the midterm elections.
Within the cable segment, we expect to generate at least mid-single-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth for the full year. And on the cost side, you should expect an increase in international cable expenses in the fourth quarter associated with broadcasting once every 4 years the ICC Cricket World Cup at STAR. Foreign exchange is always an item to be mindful of, where we're currently seeing the U.S. dollar continuing to rise against the Indian rupee and some Latin American currencies such as the Argentine peso. Now I'll remind you that, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we're expecting our normalized effective rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the mid-20% range.
Now to finish off, just a little housekeeping on New Fox. Our current plan is to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the late fall, which will provide historical and pro forma financial information and other details on New Fox. We will not be communicating separate financial information nor forward commentary on New Fox until that filing is cleared by the SEC. 
With that, I'll turn it over to James."

So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in the last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. A",439,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and thanks to you both for joining us today. So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in the last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this financial strength is driven by the growing value of our cable networks brands in the marketplace. We just delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, reflecting subscriber increases in both digital MVPD services and our younger underpenetrated channels. These gains more than offset declines in traditional subscribers. For Twenty-First Century Fox in the U.S., we have more subscribers today than we did a year ago. And in fact, for our networks that are carried on all virtual MVPD services, revenue from subscriber additions on those services are now exceeding the revenue declines from subscriber churn on traditional platforms. And these achievements, I think, are part of a growth strategy and a business agenda we've executed against really for the better part of a decade. The Disney merger and separation transaction we're getting to the finish line and the value they unlock for shareholders clearly underscore this point. 
Turning back to our fiscal year. I'm particularly proud of the creative excellence and unique experiences we deliver to customers across our businesses. We're pleased with the turnaround at our film studio, which delivered a solid performance by any measure. It led the industry in awards, including the Best Picture Academy Award for Fox Searchlight Shape of Water, and on top of this, we ended the year with the box office success of Deadpool 2, which has exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts. Our television studio has 3 shows that were #1 on their respective networks and 4 of the top 10 new dramas of the broadcast season, 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted and The Resident, driving multi-platform audience growth for entertainment on the broadcast network.
At STAR India, the addition of the 60-match Indian Premier League on STAR Sports has yielded dramatic results. The tournaments are almost a 30% increase in viewership over last year in the target audience on TV. Average match reach and engagement has increased by double digits, 15% and 13%, respectively. We also saw the IPL dramatically increase viewership on our Hotstar mobile platform. To give you 1 data point, with 10.3 million concurrent live viewers during the IPL final match, which was the most concurrently watched live digital event in the world ever.
So in closing, we're excited by the performance of the business and the growth we're seeing and the prospects for the future. Reed?"
