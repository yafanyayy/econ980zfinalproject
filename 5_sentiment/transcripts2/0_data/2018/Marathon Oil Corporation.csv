I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. res",1630,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you, to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. resource play-focused independent E&P. We made progress across every element of our playbook: balance sheet; cost structure; portfolio. And we achieved high return growth within cash flows at moderate oil prices. Our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost highest-margin oil plays demonstrated its strength as we consistently outperformed quarter after quarter.
Importantly, we balanced our 2017 CapEx and dividend with cash flows excluding the late December U.K. tax settlement under appeal while WTI averaged just above $50. We achieved that cash flow neutrality while delivering on all our 2017 commitments, including near the top right of our total company production guidance driven by a strong 31% exit rate from our U.S. resource plays.
We ended 2017 with a stronger balance sheet from our $1.75 billion reduction in gross debt, a lower cost structure with $115 million in annualized interest expense savings, a 35% reduction in unit G&A expense over the last 3 years and the lowest U.S. unit production expense since becoming an independent E&P. We also finished the year with a more concentrated portfolio with the sale of Canadian oil sands and entry into the Northern Delaware, an outstanding consistent execution across all 4 basins as evidenced by pure leading well results.
Our 2018 capital allocation philosophy is fully consistent with how we manage the business in 2017 which is to deliver a returns-focused program that balances cash flow with our CapEx end dividends and do that at a moderate oil price of $50 WTI. We'll direct over 90% to the U.S. resource plays and maximize corporate returns by focusing on high-efficiency development in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while providing flexibility for the Northern Delaware and Oklahoma to transition to multi-well pads at the appropriate pace while continuing delineation and appraisal work.
Our 2010 program was informed by the results generated by 2017. Strong performance across the Eagle Ford even as we move farther west outside Karnes County. Besson basin wells in both our Myrmidon and Hector areas of the Bakken. Outstanding results from our first STACK of volatile oil and infill development and continued learnings from our black oil infill pilot program and impressive early results in the Northern Delaware.
Internal competition for our development CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it has ever been. You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic realtime effort as we continually optimize across our 4 basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment. Moving to some specifics for the 2018 capital program. Our returns-focused development capital budget of $2.3 billion is self-funding at $50 WTI, including our $170 million dividend and will generate meaningful free cash flow at $60 WTI. We are very oil-leveraged and we will generate an incremental $500 million in operating cash flow for a $10 move from $50 to $60 WTI inclusive of our hedges. We have about 50% of our oil and about 20% of our gas hedged for 2018.
We forecast total 2018 production up 12% of the midpoint compared to 2017 on the divestiture at basis, while total annual oil production is expected to increase about 18% of the midpoint on the same basis, driven by 20% to 25% annual oil growth in the U.S. resource plays. This growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. As a reminder, we can see it's excludes Libya from all of our production guidance.
Almost 60% of development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which have demonstrated step-change performance operating at scale. Approximately 1/3 of the developing budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets where a majority of 2018's drilling activity will transition to multiwell pads while continuing a strategic delineation and appraisal.
At a basin level, I couldn't be more proud of our Eagle Ford team in 2017. They delivered there best year of well productivity despite navigating Hurricane Harvey. Activity levels in 2018 will be ratable, similar to last year, while we continue our successful high-intensity engineer completions in both our core Karnes County well and Atascosa County while leveraging the benefits of LOS pricing. We expect Eagle Ford 2018 annual production to be essentially flat while generating free cash flow.
For the Bakken, we've now delivered 15 of the 25 best middle Bakken wells in Williston Basin's history, 7 of which came in the fourth quarter. Our step-change in completion design and application of technology paired with world-class rock has proven to be a powerful combination.
In 2018, we'll further test our upgraded completion design in other parts of Hector as well as Ajax while keeping the majority of CapEx directed toward our high competence Myrmidon area. We expect strong growth in the Bakken while generating free cash flow at $50.
In Oklahoma, we delivered an impressive 9-well STACK volatile oil infill that is exceeding early expectations with the new wells averaging over 1,800 boe per day IP30. And the black oil window, we continued our pilot program with our third and easternmost infill, and these results have helped inform our pace of activity in 2018 to ensure we determine the most economic development solution for each and every DSU. Oklahoma will deliver self-funded growth this year, including secondary target delineation and a transition to 80% pad drilling while completing our STACK leasehold requirements by year-end.
And finally, Northern Delaware demonstrated remarkable execution in Q4 with average IP30s from all 11 wells of over 1,800 boe per day, including a 2 well pad averaging almost 3,300 boe per day that was 62% oil.
In 2018, we'll focus on the Upper Wolfcamp, the X-Y and Third Bone Spring. A portion of the 2018 CapEx will be spent increasing our year-end operational dock inventory by 65% as well as testing the Avalon and First Bone Spring later in the year. As a result of this concentrated capital allocation, the U.S. resource plays will increase to about 70% of the total company production mix, driving a natural expansion in margin. Through our portfolio transformation and cost structure reset, we expect to increase 2018 unit EBITDAX margins by 35% relative to 2015 on a price normalized basis.
Additionally, we expect to deliver a strong annual rate of change on the key corporate performance metrics of cash return on invested capital or CROIC or cash flow for the debt adjusted share, both of which had been integrated into our executive compensation structure. we recognize that there is no single perfect performance metric to determine the health of an E&P business and we must consider many financial and operating metrics. However, we believe when viewed together, these 2 metrics are indicative of the performance of the current development capital program as well as the over overall strength of the business. They are transparent and readily determined from publicly available data. At $50 WTI, we see a year-over-year improvement in CROIC of about 30%, while at $60 WTI that increases to over 50%, readily outpacing our production growth.  Cash flow for debt-adjusted share also enjoys a material year-over-year improvement.
Our development capital program is balanced to live within our means inclusive of the dividend at $50 WTI and generate meaningful free cash flow at $60. It is certainly refreshing to be having a conversation about free cash flow generation, and we have already established a track record of cash flow neutrality in 2017, so this represent the next natural progression of our business model. Should we continue to see pricing above $50 or execute further investments, we have multiple options: balance sheet, resource play leasing and exploration; bolt-on acquisitions; and direct return of capital to our shareholders. But any action will always be driven by seeking the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
Expanding a bit on our options. On the balance sheet, we have done some great work in 2017 and as a reminder, we have yet to receive final proceeds of $750 million from the oil sands sale. We will continue to seek opportunities to lower our corporate costs. 
We have an active resource play exploration team that is pursuing low-entry cost organic leasing opportunities that would be accretive for long-term returns. Our business development team continues to assess bolt-on acquisitions in core basins that create synergistic combinations, not just simply adding more acreage.  And finally, enhancing away their wreck return to our shareholders that builds upon our already competitive dividend of $170 million per year.
In closing, remarkable and pivotal 2017 has positioned us strongly for 2018's success. We have transitioned from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost, highest margin U.S. resource play. And we met or exceeded our 2017 commitments while living within our means, including paying our dividend at just above $50 WTI. We expect our margins to expand as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. This margin expansion story coupled with outstanding financial flexibility will help drive corporate level improvements in both cash return and cash flow growth per debt-adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2018 and beyond.
I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset, every quarter. Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

But in that criteria echoes just what you were addressing, Arun, which is we're looking for those synergistic adds that are going to enhance our overall working interest that will allow us to convert non-operated to company-operated wells, and will provide us more optionality to have longer laterals in the portfolio.

And so I would say, a lot of maybe some of the low-hanging fruit there we've captured, that went by doing so, that also brought along with it some pretty significant corporate cost reductions. We're always going to attest our comfort levels with the balance sheet first and also seek those opportunities that can continue to drive our corporate costs even lower. Once we get kind of beyond the balance sheet, I think our next view is taking a look at some of those other high-return opportunities. And the 2 that really stand out to us and we've talked about a couple of these already is really, one, our ability to drive our resource play exploration opportunities where we're looking for low-entry cost, potentially very high return and accretive return opportunities in and around current basins as well as even looking at new plays and new basins. We've already talked about bolt-on opportunities. We mentioned the Eagle Ford, but more specifically, the Northern Delaware. And then finally, we have to reflect on the fact that we're already returning $170 million of dividends directly to the shareholders. But if we meet those high-return opportunities, that's a discussion that we have each and every quarter with our Board of Directors around -- are we calibrating that dividend and that direct return to shareholders correctly? So that's going to really be the priority that we'll work through in that instance where we are seeing that consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation."

Let me kind of a start from a little bit higher level that I think address your question. If you think about the normally pressured black oil area versus the overpressured area of the STACK, there's been much less activity than normally pressured area. We've drilled 3 pilots over in that area in pretty rapid succession and really, testing the higher end of well spacing. We had between 5 and 6 infills, plus a parent in the 3 pads, but effectively tested equivalent spacing between 6 and 9 wells per section in those 3. The results haven't met our expectations thus far, and we think with our returns-focused capital allocation and it suggests it's prudent to moderate our pace there. Let us integrate those learnings and concentrate more of our efforts into the overpressure area in the near term, where there's been more industry activity. We've actually progress into the development mode, particularly in the oil window in the overpressure area. And as you mentioned, or others have mentioned, certainly very encouraged by the 9-well pan infill test. What I would say in terms of informing, this play is certainly not ubiquitous. We're integrating massive amounts of subsurface completion and production data, integrating that with all available tools and technology to get down to essentially, a DSU by DSU development solution, the right combination of both well spacing and completions. I think notionally, we would say, the east was our furthest east most test and between aggregating all of that data would suggest on the far east sides, the solution will likely be less than 6 wells per section, but well count increasing as you move west into the thicker and more pressured areas and certainly early data from the tam at 9 wells per section is a very encouraging but we need to monitor that longer-term."

I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. res",1625,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you, to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. resource play focused independent E&P. We made progress across every element of our playbook: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio. And we achieved high return growth within cash flows at moderate oil pricing. Our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost highest-margin oil plays demonstrated its strength as we consistently outperformed quarter after quarter.
Importantly, we balanced our 2017 CapEx and dividend with cash flows, excluding the late December U.K. tax settlement under appeal, while WTI averaged just above $50. We achieved that cash flow neutrality while delivering on all our 2017 commitments, including near the top end of our total company production guidance, driven by a strong 31% exit rate from our U.S. resource plays.
We ended 2017 with a stronger balance sheet from our $1.75 billion reduction in gross debt, a lower cost structure with $115 million in annualized interest expense savings, a 35% reduction in unit G&A expense over the last 3 years and the lowest U.S. unit production expense since becoming an independent E&P. We also finished the year with a more concentrated portfolio with the sale of Canadian oil sands and entry into the Northern Delaware, an outstanding consistent execution across all 4 basins as evidenced by pure leading well results.
Our 2018 capital allocation philosophy is fully consistent with how we manage the business in 2017, which is to deliver a returns-focused program that balances cash flow with our CapEx and dividend and do that at a moderate oil price of $50 WTI. We'll direct over 90% to the U.S. resource plays and maximize corporate returns by focusing on high-efficiency development in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while providing flexibility for the Northern Delaware and Oklahoma to transition to multi-well pads at the appropriate pace while continuing delineation and appraisal work.
Our 2010 program was informed by the results generated in 2017, strong performance across the Eagle Ford even as we move farther west outside Karnes County, [indiscernible] basin wells in both our Myrmidon and Hector areas of the Bakken. Outstanding results from our first STACK volatile oil infill development and continued learnings from our black oil infill pilot program and impressive early results in the Northern Delaware.
Internal competition for our development CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it's ever been. You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic realtime effort as we continually optimize across our 4 basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment.
Moving to some specifics for the 2018 capital program. Our returns-focused development capital budget of $2.3 billion is self-funding at $50 WTI, including our $170 million dividend and will generate meaningful free cash flow at $60 WTI. We are very oil leveraged and we will generate an incremental $500 million in operating cash flow for a $10 move from $50 to $60 WTI inclusive of our hedges. We have about 50% of our oil and about 20% of our gas hedged for 2018.
We forecast total 2018 production up 12% of the midpoint compared to 2017 on a divestiture basis, while total annual oil production is expected to increase about 18% at the midpoint on the same basis, driven by 20% to 25% annual oil growth in the U.S. resource plays. This growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. As a reminder, we continue to exclude Libya from all of our production guidance.
Almost 60% of development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which have demonstrated step-change performance operating at scale. Approximately 1/3 of the development budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets where a majority of 2018's drilling activity will transition to multi-well pads while continuing strategic delineation and appraisal.
At a basin level, I couldn't be more proud of our Eagle Ford team in 2017. They delivered their best year of well productivity despite navigating Hurricane Harvey. Activity levels in 2018 will be ratable, similar to last year, while we continue our successful high-intensity engineered completions in both our core Karnes County wells and Atascosa County while leveraging the benefits of LLS pricing. We expect Eagle Ford 2018 annual production to be essentially flat while generating free cash flow.
For the Bakken, we've now delivered 15 of the 25 best middle Bakken wells in Williston Basin history, 7 of which came in the fourth quarter. Our step change in completion design and application of technology, paired with world-class rock, has proven to be a powerful combination.
In 2018, we'll further test our upgraded completion design in other parts of Hector as well as Ajax while keeping the majority of CapEx directed toward our high-competence Myrmidon area. We expect strong growth in the Bakken while generating free cash flow at $50.
In Oklahoma, we delivered an impressive 9-well STACK volatile oil infill that is exceeding early expectations with the new wells averaging over 1,800 boe per day IP30. In the black oil window, we continued our pilot program with our third and easternmost infill, and these results have helped inform our pace of activity in 2018 to ensure we determine the most economic development solution for each and every DSU. Oklahoma will deliver self-funded growth this year, including secondary target delineation and a transition to 80% pad drilling while completing our STACK leasehold requirements by year-end.
And finally, Northern Delaware demonstrated remarkable execution in Q4 with average IP30s from all 11 wells of over 1,800 boe per day, including a 2 well pad averaging almost 3,300 boe per day that was 62% oil.
In 2018, we'll focus on the Upper Wolfcamp, the X-Y and Third Bone Spring. A portion of the 2018 CapEx will be spent increasing our year-end operational DUC inventory by 65% as well as testing the Avalon and First Bone Spring later in the year.
As a result of this concentrated capital allocation, the U.S. resource plays will increase to about 70% of the total company production mix, driving a natural expansion in margins. Through our portfolio transformation and cost structure reset, we expect to increase 2018 unit EBITDAX margins by 35% relative to 2015 on a price normalized basis.
Additionally, we expect to deliver a strong annual rate of change on the key corporate performance metrics of cash return on invested capital or CROIC or cash flow for debt-adjusted share, both of which have been integrated into our executive compensation structure. We recognize there is no single perfect performance metric to determine the health of an E&P business, and we must consider many financial and operating metrics.
However, we believe when viewed together, these 2 metrics are indicative of the performance of the current development capital program as well as the over overall strength of the business. They are transparent and readily determined from publicly available data. At $50 WTI, we see a year-over-year improvement in CROIC of about 30%, while at $60 WTI, that increases to over 50%, readily outpacing our production growth. Cash flow for debt-adjusted share also enjoys a material year-over-year improvement.
Our development capital program is balanced to live within our means, inclusive of the dividend at $50 WTI and generate meaningful free cash flow at $60. It is certainly refreshing to be having a conversation about free cash flow generation, and we have already established a track record of cash flow neutrality in 2017, so this represents the next natural progression of our business model.
Should we continue to see pricing above $50 or execute further investments, we have multiple options: balance sheet, resource play leasing and exploration, bolt-on acquisitions and direct return of capital to our shareholders. But any action will always be driven by seeking the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
Expanding a bit on our options. On the balance sheet, we have done some great work in 2017 and as a reminder, we have yet to receive final proceeds of $750 million from the oil sand sale. We will continue to seek opportunities to lower our corporate costs.
We have an active resource play exploration team that is pursuing low entry cost organic leasing opportunities that would be accretive for long-term returns. Our business development team continues to assess bolt-on acquisitions in core basins that create synergistic combinations, not just simply adding more acreage. And finally, enhancing away direct of capital return to our shareholders that builds upon our already competitive dividend of $170 million per year.
In closing, a remarkable and pivotal 2017 has positioned us strongly for 2018 success. We have transitioned from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost, highest-margin U.S. resource plays. And we met or exceeded our 2017 commitments while living within our means, including paying our dividend at just above $50 WTI.
We expect our margins to expand as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. This margin expansion story, coupled with outstanding financial flexibility, will help drive corporate level improvements in both cash return and cash flow growth per debt-adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2018 and beyond.
I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset, every quarter. Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

We feel that, that program is well optimized across all 4 basins.

In terms of acceleration, we always test how much, how fast can we go. And in many of these basins where we're still just migrating from kind of appraisal, delineation and the early phases of multi-well pads, there is an appropriate pace where you can process the data, learn from it and then drive those learnings into your forward decision-making.

And what we're going to be driven by is what is in the highest and best interest of the shareholder, what's going to generate the best long-term value. We always start with the balance sheet. I give a ton of credit to Dane and the team here for really doing some outstanding work on the balance sheet in 2017 through some very unique features of our capital structure. And so I would say, a lot of maybe some of the low-hanging fruit there we've captured, that went by doing so, that also brought along with it some pretty significant corporate cost reductions. We're always going to attest our comfort levels with the balance sheet first and also seek those opportunities that can continue to drive our corporate costs even lower. Once we get kind of beyond the balance sheet, I think our next view is taking a look at some of those other high-return opportunities. And the 2 that really stand out to us, and we've talked about a couple of these already is really, one, our ability to drive our resource play exploration opportunities where we're looking for low-entry cost, potentially very high return and accretive return opportunities in and around current basins as well as even looking at new plays and new basins. We've already talked about bolt-on opportunities. We mentioned the Eagle Ford, but more specifically, the Northern Delaware. And then finally, we have to reflect on the fact that we're already returning $170 million of dividends directly to the shareholder. But if we meet those high-return opportunities, that's a discussion that we have each and every quarter with our Board of Directors around -- are we calibrating that dividend and that direct return to shareholders correctly? So that's going to really be the priorities that we'll work through in that instance where we are seeing that consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation."

Let me kind of a start from a little bit higher level that I think address your question. If you think about the normally pressured black oil area versus the overpressured area of the STACK, there's been much less activity in the normally pressured area. We drilled 3 pilots over in that area in pretty rapid succession and really, testing the higher end of well spacing. We had between 5 and 6 infills plus a parent in the 3 pads, but effectively tested equivalent spacing between 6 and 9 wells per section in those 3. The results haven't met our expectations thus far. And we think, with our returns-focused capital allocation and it suggests it's prudent to moderate our pace there. Let us integrate those learnings and concentrate more of our efforts into the overpressured area in the near term, where there's been more industry activity. We've actually progressed into the development mode, particularly in the oil window in the overpressured area. And as you mentioned, or others have mentioned, certainly very encouraged by the 9-well pan infill test. What I would say in terms of informing, this play is certainly not ubiquitous. We're integrating massive amounts of subsurface completion and production data, integrating that with all available tools and technology to get down to essentially a DSU by DSU development solution, the right combination of both well spacing and completions. I think notionally, we would say, the E was our furthest eastmost test. And between aggregating all of that data it would suggest on the far east sides, the solution will likely be less than 6 wells per section, but well count increasing, as you move west, into the thicker and more pressured areas and certainly early data from the Tan at 9 wells per section is very encouraging. But we need to monitor that longer-term."

I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. resource play focused independent E&P. We made progress across every element of our playbook: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio. And we achieved high return growth within cash flows at moderate oil pricing. Our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost highest-margin oil plays demonstrated its strength as we consistently outperformed quarter after quarter.
Importantly, we balanced our 2017 CapEx and dividend with cash flows, excluding the late December U.K. tax settlement under appeal, while WTI averaged just above $50. We achieved that cash flow neutrality while delivering on all our 2017 commitments, including near the top end of our total company production guidance, driven by a strong 31% exit rate from our U.S. resource plays.
We ended 2017 with a stronger balance sheet from our $1.75 billion reduction in gross debt, a lower cost structure with $115 million in annualized interest expense savings, a 35% reduction in unit G&A expense over the last 3 years and the lowest U.S. unit production expense since becoming an independent E&P. We also finished the year with a more concentrated portfolio with the sale of Canadian oil sands and entry into the Northern Delaware, an outstanding consistent execution across all 4 basins as evidenced by pure leading well results.
Our 2018 capital allocation philosophy is fully consistent with how we managed the business in 2017, which is to deliver a returns-focused program that balances cash flow with our CapEx and dividend and do that at a moderate oil price of $50 WTI. We'll direct over 90% to the U.S. resource plays and maximize corporate returns by focusing on high-efficiency development in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while providing flexibility for the Northern Delaware and Oklahoma to transition to multi-well pads at the appropriate pace while continuing delineation and appraisal work.
Our 2018 program was informed by the results generated in 2017, strong performance across the Eagle Ford even as we moved farther west outside Karnes County; best in basin wells in both our Myrmidon and Hector areas of the Bakken; outstanding results from our first STACK volatile oil infill development, and continued learnings from our black oil infill pilot program; and impressive early results in the Northern Delaware.
Internal competition for our development CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it has ever been. You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic real-time effort as we continually optimize across our 4 basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment.
Moving to some specifics for the 2018 capital program. Our returns-focused development capital budget of $2.3 billion is self-funding at $50 WTI, including our $170 million dividend and will generate meaningful free cash flow at $60 WTI. We are very oil leveraged, and we will generate an incremental $500 million in operating cash flow for a $10 move from $50 to $60 WTI, inclusive of our hedges. We have about 50% of our oil and about 20% of our gas hedged for 2018.
We forecast total 2018 production up 12% at the midpoint compared to 2017 on a divestiture basis, while total annual oil production is expected to increase about 18% at the midpoint on the same basis, driven by 20% to 25% annual oil growth in the U.S. resource plays. This growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. As a reminder, we continue to exclude Libya from all of our production guidance.
Almost 60% of the development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which have demonstrated step-change performance operating at scale. Approximately 1/3 of the development budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets, where a majority of 2018's drilling activity will transition to multi-well pads while continuing strategic delineation and appraisal.
At a basin level, I couldn't be more proud of our Eagle Ford team in 2017. They delivered their best year of well productivity despite navigating Hurricane Harvey. Activity levels in 2018 will be ratable, similar to last year, while we continue our successful high-intensity engineered completions in both our core Karnes County wells and Atascosa County while leveraging the benefits of LLS pricing. We expect Eagle Ford 2018 annual production to be essentially flat while generating free cash flow.
For the Bakken, we've now delivered 15 of the 25 best middle Bakken wells in Williston Basin history, 7 of which came in the fourth quarter. Our step change in completion design and application of technology paired with world-class rock has proven to be a powerful combination.
In 2018, we'll further test our upgraded completion design in other parts of Hector as well as Ajax while keeping the majority of CapEx directed toward our high-confidence Myrmidon area. We expect strong growth in the Bakken while generating free cash flow at $50.
In Oklahoma, we delivered an impressive 9-well STACK volatile oil infill that is exceeding early expectations with the new wells averaging over 1,800 boe per day IP30. In the black oil window, we continued our pilot program with our third and easternmost infill, and these results have helped inform our pace of activity in 2018 to ensure we determine the most economic development solution for each and every DSU. Oklahoma will deliver self-funded growth this year, including secondary target delineation and a transition to 80% pad drilling while completing our STACK leasehold requirements by year-end.
And finally, Northern Delaware demonstrated remarkable execution in Q4 with average IP30s from all 11 wells of over 1,800 boe per day, including a 2-well pad averaging almost 3,300 boe per day that was 62% oil.
In 2018, we'll focus on the Upper Wolfcamp, the X-Y and Third Bone Spring. A portion of the 2018 CapEx will be spent increasing our year-end operational DUC inventory by 65% as well as testing the Avalon and First Bone Spring later in the year.
As a result of this concentrated capital allocation, the U.S. resource plays will increase to about 70% of the total company production mix, driving a natural expansion in margins. Through our portfolio transformation and cost structure reset, we expect to increase 2018 unit EBITDAX margins by 35% relative to 2015 on a price normalized basis.
Additionally, we expect to deliver a strong annual rate of change on the key corporate performance metrics of cash return on invested capital, or CROIC, and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, both of which have been integrated into our executive compensation structure. We recognize there is no single perfect performance metric to determine the health of an E&P business, and we must consider many financial and operating metrics.
However, we believe when viewed together, these 2 metrics are indicative of the performance of the current development capital program as well as the over overall strength of the business. They are transparent and readily determined from publicly available data. At $50 WTI, we see a year-over-year improvement in CROIC of about 30%, while at $60 WTI, that increases to over 50%, readily outpacing our production growth. Cash flow per debt-adjusted share also enjoys a material year-over-year improvement.
Our development capital program is balanced to live within our means, inclusive of the dividend at $50 WTI and generate meaningful free cash flow at $60. It is certainly refreshing to be having a conversation about free cash flow generation, and we have already established a track record of cash flow neutrality in 2017, so this represents the next natural progression of our business model.
Should we continue to see pricing above $50 or execute further divestments, we have multiple options: balance sheet, resource play leasing and exploration, bolt-on acquisitions and direct return of capital to our shareholders. But any action will always be driven by seeking the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
Expanding a bit on our options. On the balance sheet, we have done some great work in 2017, and as a reminder, we have yet to receive final proceeds of $750 million from the oil sand sale. We will continue to seek opportunities to lower our corporate costs.
We have an active resource play exploration team that is pursuing low entry cost organic leasing opportunities that would be accretive to long-term returns. Our business development team continues to assess bolt-on acquisitions in core basins that create synergistic combinations, not just simply adding more acreage. And finally, enhancing our direct of capital return to our shareholders that builds upon our already competitive dividend of $170 million per year.
In closing, a remarkable and pivotal 2017 has positioned us strongly for 2018 success. We have transitioned from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost, highest-margin U.S. resource plays. And we met or exceeded our 2017 commitments while living within our means, including paying our dividend, at just above $50 WTI.
We expect our margins to expand as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. This margin expansion story, coupled with outstanding financial flexibility, will help drive corporate level improvements in both cash return and cash flow growth per debt-adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2018 and beyond.
I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset every quarter. Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

And certainly, from a technology aspect, I truly believe that what you're seeing here is also a bit of the strength of our 4-basin model approach where we're able to learn across basins and apply those earnings very rapidly across all of our major plays. So when we identify a best practice or a technique that's proving dividends in one of our plays, we're very rapidly transferring that into our other basins, and that allows us, I believe, to get up that learning curve very, very quickly."

But that criteria echoes just what you were addressing, Arun, which is we're looking for those synergistic adds that are going to enhance our overall working interests, that will allow us to convert nonoperated to company-operated wells and will provide us more optionality to have longer laterals in the portfolio. And so we continue to work that hard. It's still very competitive in the Northern Delaware. I mean, you probably will have noted in our material that we were a little cagey even about the location of some of our well results, and it's because it remains an active area. And our land team and our asset team are out there looking for those kind of hand-in-glove fits that are going to make a difference in our position."

But in respect that if we do see a consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation through the year, which obviously would be north of our breakeven and certainly in the $60 range we would be, we're going to go through kind of our priority list at that point. And what we're going to be driven by is what is in the highest and best interest of the shareholder, what's going to generate the best long-term value. We always start with the balance sheet. I give a ton of credit to Dane and the team here for really doing some outstanding work on the balance sheet in 2017 through some very unique features of our capital structure. And so I would say a lot of -- maybe some of the low-hanging fruit there we've captured, that -- by doing so, that also brought along with it some pretty significant corporate cost reductions. We're always going to, though, test our comfort level with the balance sheet first and also seek those opportunities that can continue to drive our corporate costs even lower. Once we get kind of beyond the balance sheet, I think our next view is taking a look at some of those other high-return opportunities. And the 2 that really stand out to us, and we've talked about a couple of these already, is really, one, our ability to drive our resource play exploration opportunities where we're looking for low-entry cost, potentially very high return and accretive return opportunities in and around current basins as well as even looking at new plays and new basins. We've already talked about bolt-on opportunities. We mentioned the Eagle Ford, but more specifically, the Northern Delaware. And then finally, we have to reflect on the fact that we're already returning $170 million of dividends directly to the shareholder. But if we meet those other high-return opportunities, that's a discussion that we have each and every quarter with our Board of Directors around are we calibrating that dividend and that direct return to shareholders correctly? So that's going to really be the priorities that we'll work through in that instance where we are seeing that consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation."

Let me kind of a start from a little bit higher level that I think addresses your question. If you think about the normally pressured black oil area versus the overpressured area of the STACK, there's been much less activity in the normally pressured area. We drilled 3 pilots over in that area in pretty rapid succession and, really, testing the higher end of well spacing. We had between 5 and 6 infills plus a parent in the 3 pads, but effectively tested equivalent spacing between 6 and 9 wells per section in those 3. The results haven't met our expectations thus far. And we think, with our returns-focused capital allocation and it suggests it's prudent to moderate our pace there. Let us integrate those learnings and concentrate more of our efforts into the overpressured area in the near term, where there's been more industry activity. We've actually progressed into the development mode, particularly in the oil window in the overpressured area. And as you mentioned, or others have mentioned, certainly very encouraged by the 9-well Tan infill test. What I would say in terms of informing, this play is certainly not ubiquitous. We're integrating massive amounts of subsurface completion and production data, integrating that with all available tools and technology to get down to essentially a DSU by DSU development solution, the right combination of both well spacing and completions. I think notionally, we would say, the E was our furthest eastmost test. And between aggregating all of that data, it would suggest on the far east sides, the solution will likely be less than 6 wells per section, but well count increasing, as you move west into the thicker and more pressured areas, and certainly early data from the Tan at 9 wells per section is very encouraging. But we'll need to monitor that longer term."

I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. reso",1627,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017 followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. resource play focused independent E&P. We made progress across every element of our playbook: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio. And we achieved high return growth within cash flows at moderate oil pricing. Our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost highest-margin oil plays demonstrated its strength as we consistently outperformed quarter after quarter.
Importantly, we balanced our 2017 CapEx and dividend with cash flows, excluding the late December U.K. tax settlement under appeal, while WTI averaged just above $50. We achieved that cash flow neutrality while delivering on all our 2017 commitments, including near the top end of our total company production guidance, driven by a strong 31% exit rate from our U.S. resource plays.
We ended 2017 with a stronger balance sheet from our $1.75 billion reduction in gross debt, a lower cost structure with $115 million in annualized interest expense savings, a 35% reduction in unit G&A expense over the last 3 years and the lowest U.S. unit production expense since becoming an independent E&P. We also finished the year with a more concentrated portfolio with the sale of Canadian oil sands and entry into the Northern Delaware, an outstanding consistent execution across all 4 basins as evidenced by pure leading well results.
Our 2018 capital allocation philosophy is fully consistent with how we managed the business in 2017, which is to deliver a returns-focused program that balances cash flow with our CapEx and dividend and do that at a moderate oil price of $50 WTI. We'll direct over 90% to the U.S. resource plays and maximize corporate returns by focusing on high-efficiency development in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while providing flexibility for the Northern Delaware and Oklahoma to transition to multi-well pads at the appropriate pace while continuing delineation and appraisal work.
Our 2018 program was informed by the results generated in 2017, strong performance across the Eagle Ford even as we moved farther west outside Karnes County; best in basin wells in both our Myrmidon and Hector areas of the Bakken; outstanding results from our first STACK volatile oil infill development, and continued learnings from our black oil infill pilot program; and impressive early results in the Northern Delaware.
Internal competition for our development CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it has ever been. You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic real-time effort as we continually optimize across our 4 basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment.
Moving to some specifics for the 2018 capital program. Our returns-focused development capital budget of $2.3 billion is self-funding at $50 WTI, including our $170 million dividend and will generate meaningful free cash flow at $60 WTI. We are very oil leveraged, and we will generate an incremental $500 million in operating cash flow for a $10 move from $50 to $60 WTI, inclusive of our hedges. We have about 50% of our oil and about 20% of our gas hedged for 2018.
We forecast total 2018 production up 12% at the midpoint compared to 2017 on a divestiture basis, while total annual oil production is expected to increase about 18% at the midpoint on the same basis, driven by 20% to 25% annual oil growth in the U.S. resource plays. This growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. As a reminder, we continue to exclude Libya from all of our production guidance.
Almost 60% of the development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which have demonstrated step-change performance operating at scale. Approximately 1/3 of the development budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets, where a majority of 2018's drilling activity will transition to multi-well pads while continuing strategic delineation and appraisal.
At a basin level, I couldn't be more proud of our Eagle Ford team in 2017. They delivered their best year of well productivity despite navigating Hurricane Harvey. Activity levels in 2018 will be ratable, similar to last year, while we continue our successful high-intensity engineered completions in both our core Karnes County wells and Atascosa County while leveraging the benefits of LLS pricing. We expect Eagle Ford 2018 annual production to be essentially flat while generating free cash flow.
For the Bakken, we've now delivered 15 of the 25 best middle Bakken wells in Williston Basin history, 7 of which came in the fourth quarter. Our step change in completion design and application of technology paired with world-class rock has proven to be a powerful combination.
In 2018, we'll further test our upgraded completion design in other parts of Hector as well as Ajax while keeping the majority of CapEx directed toward our high-confidence Myrmidon area. We expect strong growth in the Bakken while generating free cash flow at $50.
In Oklahoma, we delivered an impressive 9-well STACK volatile oil infill that is exceeding early expectations with the new wells averaging over 1,800 boe per day IP30. In the black oil window, we continued our pilot program with our third and easternmost infill, and these results have helped inform our pace of activity in 2018 to ensure we determine the most economic development solution for each and every DSU. Oklahoma will deliver self-funded growth this year, including secondary target delineation and a transition to 80% pad drilling while completing our STACK leasehold requirements by year-end.
And finally, Northern Delaware demonstrated remarkable execution in Q4 with average IP30s from all 11 wells of over 1,800 boe per day, including a 2-well pad averaging almost 3,300 boe per day that was 62% oil.
In 2018, we'll focus on the Upper Wolfcamp, the X-Y and Third Bone Spring. A portion of the 2018 CapEx will be spent increasing our year-end operational DUC inventory by 65% as well as testing the Avalon and First Bone Spring later in the year.
As a result of this concentrated capital allocation, the U.S. resource plays will increase to about 70% of the total company production mix, driving a natural expansion in margins. Through our portfolio transformation and cost structure reset, we expect to increase 2018 unit EBITDAX margins by 35% relative to 2015 on a price normalized basis.
Additionally, we expect to deliver a strong annual rate of change on the key corporate performance metrics of cash return on invested capital, or CROIC, and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, both of which have been integrated into our executive compensation structure. We recognize there is no single perfect performance metric to determine the health of an E&P business, and we must consider many financial and operating metrics.
However, we believe when viewed together, these 2 metrics are indicative of the performance of the current development capital program as well as the over overall strength of the business. They are transparent and readily determined from publicly available data. At $50 WTI, we see a year-over-year improvement in CROIC of about 30%, while at $60 WTI, that increases to over 50%, readily outpacing our production growth. Cash flow per debt-adjusted share also enjoys a material year-over-year improvement.
Our development capital program is balanced to live within our means, inclusive of the dividend at $50 WTI and generate meaningful free cash flow at $60. It is certainly refreshing to be having a conversation about free cash flow generation, and we have already established a track record of cash flow neutrality in 2017, so this represents the next natural progression of our business model.
Should we continue to see pricing above $50 or execute further divestments, we have multiple options: balance sheet, resource play leasing and exploration, bolt-on acquisitions and direct return of capital to our shareholders. But any action will always be driven by seeking the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
Expanding a bit on our options. On the balance sheet, we have done some great work in 2017, and as a reminder, we have yet to receive final proceeds of $750 million from the oil sand sale. We will continue to seek opportunities to lower our corporate costs.
We have an active resource play exploration team that is pursuing low entry cost organic leasing opportunities that would be accretive to long-term returns. Our business development team continues to assess bolt-on acquisitions in core basins that create synergistic combinations, not just simply adding more acreage. And finally, enhancing our direct of capital return to our shareholders that builds upon our already competitive dividend of $170 million per year.
In closing, a remarkable and pivotal 2017 has positioned us strongly for 2018 success. We have transitioned from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the 4 lowest-cost, highest-margin U.S. resource plays. And we met or exceeded our 2017 commitments while living within our means, including paying our dividend, at just above $50 WTI.
We expect our margins to expand as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. This margin expansion story, coupled with outstanding financial flexibility, will help drive corporate level improvements in both cash return and cash flow growth per debt-adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2018 and beyond.
I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset every quarter. Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

We feel that, that program is well optimized across all 4 basins.

In terms of acceleration, we always test how much, how fast can we go. And in many of these basins where we're still just migrating from kind of appraisal, delineation in the early phases of multi-well pads, there is an appropriate pace where you can process the data, learn from it and then drive those learnings into your forward decision-making.

And we certainly evaluate those on an ongoing basis through both the asset team as well as our business development team. So that's always on the table. I mean, a lot of folks have solidified their positions there. We are in a very high-quality area of the Eagle Ford, which makes it a little challenging, because the folks usually around us are also pretty comfortable with their position as well.

Again, just to reiterate, we're very comfortable with the capital program irrespective of the ultimate prices that we see in 2018. But in respect that if we do see a consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation through the year, which obviously would be north of our breakeven and certainly in the $60 range we would be, we're going to go through kind of our priority list at that point. And what we're going to be driven by is what is in the highest and best interest of the shareholder, what's going to generate the best long-term value. We always start with the balance sheet. I give a ton of credit to Dane and the team here for really doing some outstanding work on the balance sheet in 2017 through some very unique features of our capital structure. And so I would say a lot of -- maybe some of the low-hanging fruit there we've captured, that -- by doing so, that also brought along with it some pretty significant corporate cost reductions. We're always going to, though, test our comfort level with the balance sheet first and also seek those opportunities that can continue to drive our corporate costs even lower. Once we get kind of beyond the balance sheet, I think our next view is taking a look at some of those other high-return opportunities. And the 2 that really stand out to us, and we've talked about a couple of these already, is really, one, our ability to drive our resource play exploration opportunities where we're looking for low-entry cost, potentially very high return and accretive return opportunities in and around current basins as well as even looking at new plays and new basins. We've already talked about bolt-on opportunities. We mentioned the Eagle Ford, but more specifically, the Northern Delaware. And then finally, we have to reflect on the fact that we're already returning $170 million of dividends directly to the shareholder. But if we meet those other high-return opportunities, that's a discussion that we have each and every quarter with our Board of Directors around are we calibrating that dividend and that direct return to shareholders correctly? So that's going to really be the priorities that we'll work through in that instance where we are seeing that consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation."

Let me kind of a start from a little bit higher level that I think addresses your question. If you think about the normally pressured black oil area versus the overpressured area of the STACK, there's been much less activity in the normally pressured area. We drilled 3 pilots over in that area in pretty rapid succession and, really, testing the higher end of well spacing. We had between 5 and 6 infills plus a parent in the 3 pads, but effectively tested equivalent spacing between 6 and 9 wells per section in those 3. The results haven't met our expectations thus far. And we think, with our returns-focused capital allocation and it suggests it's prudent to moderate our pace there. Let us integrate those learnings and concentrate more of our efforts into the overpressured area in the near term, where there's been more industry activity. We've actually progressed into the development mode, particularly in the oil window in the overpressured area. And as you mentioned, or others have mentioned, certainly very encouraged by the 9-well Tan infill test. What I would say in terms of informing, this play is certainly not ubiquitous. We're integrating massive amounts of subsurface completion and production data, integrating that with all available tools and technology to get down to essentially a DSU by DSU development solution, the right combination of both well spacing and completions. I think notionally, we would say, the E was our furthest eastmost test. And between aggregating all of that data, it would suggest on the far east sides, the solution will likely be less than 6 wells per section, but well count increasing, as you move west into the thicker and more pressured areas, and certainly early data from the Tan at 9 wells per section is very encouraging. But we'll need to monitor that longer term."

After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement in co",1166,"Thanks, Zack, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. 
After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement in corporate cash at strip pricing. Our differentiated multi-basin model delivered strong 9% sequential U.S. oil growth. And our asset-level execution underpinned our confidence to raise our full year 2018 resource play guidance, while also steering to the upper end of our total company guidance, all of this with our $2.3 billion development capital budget unchanged. An important point to note is that our first quarter development CapEx is not ratable, due primarily to some higher working interest relative to the remainder of 2018 and other timing effects.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. We continue to expand the core of our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions through enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County respectively, uplifting economics and inventory quality while generating significant free cash flow from both assets. Bakken grew production 7% sequentially and continued it's basin leading performance setting new 30-day oil IP records in both the middle Bakken and the Three Forks. The June and Chauncey wells in West Myrmidon establish new records for the basin and oil production with an average IP30 of almost 3,500 barrels of oil per day. The Arkin well in the Hector area setting new Williston Basin record for the Three Forks formation at an IP30 of just over 3,000 barrels of oil per day. And just to underscore the compelling economics of this well, the Arkin has already achieved payout. 
Finally, a West Myrmidon well brought to late in the quarter achieved a remarkable IP24 of over 10,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, but has not yet achieved 30 days of production. In part because we continue to bring on these basin-leading wells, we're proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all North Dakota requirements and have the necessary flexibility to ensure no flow assurance issue as we continue to pursue this high return program.
Eagle Ford held production flat sequentially and delivered results in Q1 that spanned the entirety of our acreage position. These included 11 outstanding wells in Atascosa County with an average IP30 of over 1,600 oil equivalent barrels per day at an oil cut of 76%. The Eagle Ford continued its focus on enhanced completion design and contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LOS based oil realizations that were above WTI.
Oklahoma and Northern Delaware began their shift to primarily multiwell pad drilling that will dominate the remainder of the 2018 programs. In Oklahoma, oil production grew 25% sequentially, primarily from outstanding base performance that included the infill that came online late in the fourth quarter. We largely completed our STACK leasehold program in the first quarter and expect to be greater than 90% in the STACK by year-end. 
Looking ahead, 95% of our remaining 2018 wells to sales in Oklahoma will be in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP, the majority of which will come from 4 multi-well infills.
Northern Delaware, though early in its development cycle, delivered wells across Malaga, Red Hills and Ranger areas at an average IP30 of 1,460 oil equivalent barrels per day at 69% oil cut. Late in the quarter, we dropped the first 2 Cypress infill wells online ahead of schedule and will report results once we have 30 days of production from the entire pilot. Additionally, in the last 6 months, we've added 165 gross locations with an average working interest of 65% through trades and a small bolt-on. And continue to pursue opportunities that increase our working interest, generate more operative sections and provide more extended lateral optionality. 
It's difficult to speak about the Permian without addressing differentials and takeaway. We're currently benefiting from our Midland basis swaps and open positions cover us for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discount of less than $1 to WTI for the second half of 2018 and all of 2019. Our swaps will help protect over half our forecasted oil production for the remainder of the year.
On takeaway, it is important to stress that today, Northern Delaware counts for only about 4% of our overall production mix. However, while we anticipate no flow assurance issues, we're planning for future growth and have expanded our oil gathered in agreements and are assessing both gas gathering and commitments for the longer-term. We're also transitioning our water to pipe throughout the year, which will reduce unit operating costs for the basin. 
In addition to our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in EGE, which contributed $124 million of EBITDAX for the quarter despite a turnaround at the LNG plant. This unique gas infrastructure, LNG plant, gas plant, methanol plant, is well positioned to not only deliver free cash flow today but also could capture additional equity and third-party gas as the natural point of aggregation in the region.
Our financial flexibility is at the top of our peer group and was further strengthened by receipt of proceeds from Libya and our final Canadian oil sands payment. This flexibility allows us to pursue multiple high return uses of free cash but we are taking a disciplined approach and we are not considering large-scale M&A.
Repurchasing shares is an option, and we have $1.5 billion authorization already in place. And we can also look at our already competitive $170 million annual dividend. We have enjoyed higher pricing for just over 1 quarter. But as our confidence in sustainable free cash flow generation continues to grow, we will consider returning additional capital to shareholders, and it is a topic of ongoing discussion with our Board.
Our objective is to strike the right balance between additional direct return of capital and accretive opportunistic low entry cost resource capture. Specifically, we've successfully added quality operated locations in the Northern Delaware through trades and a small bolt-on. And have captured over 250,000 acres across multiple onshore exploration place, including a material position in the emerging Louisiana Chalk at less than $900 an acre. We recognize that these unique resource capture opportunities are episodic and challenging to forecast. We spent $94 million in Q1 and expect another $150 million in Q2. But they offer the potential to generate outsized full cycle returns.
We now expect to grow our resource plays 25% to 30% year-over-year, up from 20% to 25% for both oil and BOE with our development capital budget unchanged.  And we expect our total company annual growth to be towards the upper end of our guidance, also for both oil and BOE.
But growth is simply an outcome of our returns focused capital allocation. Thank you, and with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Guy, maybe just for everyone on the call, we have talked about the Bakken having a forward inventory at kind of current activity levels of just over 12 years. And the way, I think about our success in the Hector today is that we're continuing to delineate across that acreage position there. That's about 115,000 net acres. We have had very strong early success there, record-setting wells there. But we're still marching across that acreage position. And I view this as thus far really providing us an opportunity to uplift the intrinsic value and economics of that 12 years of inventory as we elevate the inventory that resides within the Hector area. Additionally, we're still looking to test other areas this year in the Bakken, including Elk Creek as well as the Ajax area, as we continue to apply the same workflows that started in West Myrmidon, transitioned then into Hector. We're looking to apply those as well in these other areas. So right now it's a great outcome. All credit to the team there for their innovation. They are competing strongly at the very top of the portfolio with these kinds of results."

Well, I think you said it well, Guy. It's very difficult for us to forecast in this area, because typically these unique opportunities are what we would classify as potential lost opportunities, meaning that if we don't act upon them, they are likely going to move away or at least the low-cost entry element of them will move away from us.  So it is difficult for us to forecast. That's one of the reasons why, we at least the provide some visibility into the next quarter for you all. So that was an important element. I think as we consider the scope of it in ensuring that we do apply discipline to this element of our business, just like all other elements of our business, it starts with the return and capital allocation. When the team brings in an opportunity, it has to compete on a similar basis as our other opportunities, meaning that there has to be a path there to achieve economics, full cycle economics, that are competitive with our existing portfolio. These are still exploration play with a finite chance of success. But we have to be able to see materiality, quality and value proposition, meaning that they can come in and compete for capital allocation. The other point that I would make just on the spend question is that as you think about the framework, although we're very excited  about the greenfield leasing that we've accomplished, bear in mind that the real work comes after the leasing occurs. We have to get in there then and go through appraisal, delineation, and we hope it's ultimately predevelopment. And all of those activities will require capital allocation. So as we look forward in time, we have to also consider those future capital needs that are beyond just a greenfield leasing."

First of all, I want to emphasize return of capital to shareholders is and has been an ongoing dialogue with our board. We obviously discuss our dividend, which is very competitive in our space, with our board each and every quarter. So that concept of return of capital to shareholders and the constructive tension with other investment opportunities is and center with the leadership and with our board each and every time we sit down to discuss it. What I would say is that, going back to my opening comments, that repurchasing shares is definitely an option. We have an authorization of $1.5 billion already in place. We can also consider the level of our dividend, although at $170 million annually, it's very competitive, that also needs to go into the calculus. And you are right, I mean, we -- certainly as we look ahead, we absolutely see the opportunity to get into a mode of sustainable cash -- free cash flow generation. And I think as we move through that, returning additional capital to shareholders will feature in that forward dialogue. I would maybe mention though just a few things there is that, first of all, we feel that we need kind of a minimum cash balance to run our business given the scale and scope of it of around $750 million of cash on hand, and that's plus or minus. I would also point out that all companies are at different stages in their respective business models. We have addressed our balance sheet very clearly last year. We've also largely completed our major portfolio dispositions, meaning that we don't expect additional near-term material proceeds. As I was just chatting about with Guy, we also recognize that leasing cost is just the first step in capturing some of the low entry cost opportunities. So we must consider those future capital needs as well. All that to say is the bottom line is that all of these factors go into considerations for pursuing what is the best -- what are the best options for long-term value creation through the use of free cash. And I view it as it's not an either/or proposition. We see multiple uses for that, including enhancing our direct return of capital. All of that can be accommodated."

But obviously, the Louisiana Austin Chalk, as you mentioned, did go through a bit of a development phase.

So that does go, and we look at obviously the product mix. But we are more driven by making sure that we're deploying to the correct overall economic value proposition. And today when you look at our relative capital allocation that we described earlier in the year, it's not surprising that a big component of our capital allocation is flowing to both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while we progress the early development phases from a strategic standpoint certainly in both Northern Delaware and Oklahoma. So we feel that we have already accommodated that -- not only the oil cut but the overall economics that we see in the Bakken in our capital deployment. But again, as we get new data, we can always look at adjusting and redeploying within our multi-basin model.

But 70% of our operated DSUs in the STACK are in the overpressured window and about 30% in the normally pressured.

The most recent one which  we did a multi-horizon test there including Meramec, and with Woodford, we a massive data set of production, subsurface and then intentional data acquisition. We're now integrating that into the same kind of internally developed workflow, multidiscipline integration work flow that we've applied in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken to drive the results that you're seeing from us there. I would note and just kind of keep in mind in those 2 basins we've got about on the order of 1,500 infills, whereas in the normally pressured window we've got 19 infill locations so far. So at a different phase. We have taken a few very significant learnings thus far and continued to optimize while we focus in the overpressured area and come back. But the Meramec wells will deliver about $700,000 completed well cost lower than the Eves and through the first 60 days we are seeing oil that are comparable. So no degradation in performance there. And we believe we can take costs down even further. We're currently evaluating the design that's more in the $3.5 million completed well cost range. So continue to advance our learnings, more optimization to do. And while we are in that integration and calculation phase, we're going to shift are focus more into the overpressured area."

What that's translated to as we modified our designs is a significant operating or uplifting of the inventory outside of County. And that's why we keep sort of highlighting the results from Atascosa.

I think -- this is Lee  I believe that there remains an incentive for all operators to continue to drive toward more contiguous positions, particularly in Eddy and Lea County and Northern Delaware. I think that the progress that the team made over the last 6 months since we really close to those deals is very solid. But this is going to take time, particularly when you start discussing trades. You have to get to the point where you get to an equivalent value proposition with another party. So the incentive may be there. But as I like to tell people, no one likes to say they have the ugly baby in the trade. And so it just takes time. And a lot of times those trades are going to come in smaller bits as well. But we have a dedicated team that is focused on this. We believe that is a important for that asset going forward in time to continue to up what we believe is a great acreage position in Northern Delaware.

And what it's taken us to is an approach that allows us to customize to a very subregional level.

We custom design to take advantage of what we understand about local characteristics. The Hector record -- record Three Forks well from Hector, the 2 West Myrmidon wells you mentioned, those records weren't delivered by accident. It's true that there was good rock to start with.

All those things come into play. But when I -- I think that way, again, to think about 2018 for both of those basins is Bakken is absolutely on a growth trajectory, but is also linked to generate free cash flow this year. Eagle Ford, we're managing to a more or less flat production profile in order to take advantage of its capital efficiency and ability to generate free cash flow to drive other elements of our portfolio. I think on your question around, you mentioned, inflation. Thus far, we feel that the inflation assumptions that were implicit in our original $2.3 billion plan are still holding true. And so we -- although it's something that our teams not only look to manage but actually look to offset each and every day, we feel very comfortable as this stage that we have that accounted for fully in our $2.3 billion development capital budget. 2019 is something that we're really not talking about quite yet. But obviously, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford as well as our other basins will all be part of a multi-basin optimization as we go into 2019. And we will allocate capital based on the best available data when we go through our planning cycle. So nothing is locked in and there are no constraints around the Bakken and the Eagle Ford of today that would not allow us to flex those assets up or down."

After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and c",1170,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. 
After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and corporate cash returns at strip pricing. Our differentiated multi-basin model delivered strong 9% sequential U.S. oil growth. And our asset-level execution underpinned our confidence to raise our full year 2018 resource play guidance, while also steering to the upper end of our total company guidance, all of this with our $2.3 billion development capital budget unchanged. An important point to note is that our first quarter development CapEx is not ratable, due primarily to some higher working interest relative to the remainder of 2018 and other timing effects.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. We continue to expand the core of our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions through enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County, respectively, uplifting economics and inventory quality while generating significant free cash flow from both assets. Bakken grew production 7% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance setting new 30-day oil IP records in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. The June and Chauncey wells in West Myrmidon established new records for the basin and oil production, with an average IP30 of almost 3,500 barrels of oil per day. The Arkin well in the Hector area, setting new Williston Basin record for the Three Forks formation at an IP30 of just over 3,000 barrels of oil per day. And just to underscore the compelling economics of this well, the Arkin has already achieved payout. 
Finally, a West Myrmidon well brought to sales in the quarter achieved a remarkable IP24 of over 10,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, but has not yet achieved 30 days of production. In part because we continue to bring on these basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all of North Dakota requirements and have the necessary flexibility to ensure no flow assurance issues as we continue to pursue this high-return program.
Eagle Ford held production flat sequentially and delivered results in Q1 that spanned the entirety of our acreage position. These included 11 outstanding wells in Atascosa County, with an average IP30 of over 1,600 oil equivalent barrels per day at an oil cut of 76%. The Eagle Ford continued its focus on enhanced completion designs and contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were above WTI.
Oklahoma and Northern Delaware began their shift to primarily multi-well pad drilling that will dominate the remainder of their 2018 programs. In Oklahoma, oil production grew 25% sequentially, primarily from outstanding base performance that included the Tan infill that came online late in the fourth quarter. We largely completed our STACK leasehold program in the first quarter and expect to be greater than 90% HBP-ed in the STACK by year-end. 
Looking ahead, 95% of our remaining 2018 wells to sales in Oklahoma will be in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP, the majority of which will come from 4 multi-well infills.
Northern Delaware, though still early in its development cycle, delivered wells across Malaga, Red Hills and Ranger areas at an average IP30 of 1,460 oil equivalent barrels per day at 69% oil cut. Late in the quarter, we brought the first 2 Cypress infill wells online ahead of schedule and we'll report results once we have 30 days of production from the entire pilot. Additionally, in the last 6 months, we've added 165 risked gross co-op locations, with an average working interest of 65% through trades and a small bolt-on and continue to pursue opportunities that increase our working interest, generate more operative sections and provide more extended lateral optionality. 
It's difficult to speak about the Permian without addressing differentials and takeaway. We're currently benefiting from our Midland-Cushing basis swaps and open positions cover us for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discount of less than $1 to WTI for the second half of 2018 and all of 2019. Our swaps will help protect over half our forecasted oil production for the remainder of the year.
On takeaway, it is important to stress that today, Northern Delaware counts for only about 4% of our overall production mix. However, while we anticipate no flow assurance issues, we are planning for future growth and have expanded our oil gathered in agreements and are assessing both gas gathering and FT commitments for the longer term. We are also transitioning our water-to-pipe throughout the year, which will reduce unit operating costs for the basin. 
In addition to our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in Agee, which contributed $124 million of EBITDAX for the quarter despite a turnaround at the LNG plant. This unique gas infrastructure, LNG plant, gas plant, methanol plant, is well positioned to not only deliver free cash flow today but also could capture additional equity and third-party gas as the natural point of aggregation in the region.
Our financial flexibility is at the top of our peer group and was further strengthened by receipt of proceeds from Libya and our final Canadian oil sands payment. This flexibility allows us to pursue multiple high-return uses of free cash, but we are taking a disciplined approach and we are not considering large-scale M&A.
Repurchasing shares is an option, and we have a $1.5 billion authorization already in place. And we can also look at our already competitive $170 million annual dividend. We have enjoyed higher pricing for just over a quarter. But as our confidence in sustainable free cash flow generation continues to grow, we will consider returning additional capital to shareholders, and it is a topic of ongoing discussion with our board.
Our objective is to strike the right balance between additional direct return of capital and accretive opportunistic low-entry cost resource capture. Specifically, we have successfully added quality operated locations in the Northern Delaware through trades and a small bolt-on and have captured over 250,000 acres across multiple onshore exploration plays, including a material position in the emerging Louisiana Chalk at less than $900 an acre. We recognize that these unique resource capture opportunities are episodic and challenging to forecast. We spent $94 million in Q1 and expect another $150 million in Q2, but they offer the potential to generate outsized full cycle returns.
We now expect to grow resource plays 25% to 30% year-over-year, up from 20% to 25% for both oil and BOE, with our development capital budget unchanged.  And we expect our total company annual growth to be towards the upper end of our guidance, also for both oil and BOE.
But growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. Thank you, and with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Guy, maybe just for everyone on the call, we have talked about the Bakken having a forward inventory at kind of current activity levels of just over 12 years. And the way I think about our success in the Hector today is that we're continuing to delineate across that acreage position there. That's about 115,000 net acres. We have had very strong early success there, record-setting wells there. But we're still marching across that acreage position. And I view this as, thus far, really providing us an opportunity to uplift the intrinsic value and economics of that 12 years of inventory as we elevate the inventory that resides within the Hector area. Additionally, we are still looking to test other areas this year in the Bakken, including Elk Creek as well as the Ajax area, as we continue to apply the same workflows that started in West Myrmidon, transitioned then into Hector. We're looking to apply those as well in these other areas. So right now it's a great outcome. All credit to the team there for their innovation. They are competing strongly at the very top of the portfolio with these kinds of results."

But you've obviously have been successful in adding new acreage to the portfolio at low cost. I knew you characterize the spending there as episodic, and I'm sure you will be opportunistic. But how should we be thinking of the size or materiality of that program over time? Is there any framework that you could share? I'm really just curious as to how you instill a sense of discipline into the organization there to ensure that you're maximizing the full cycle return potential of the dollars that you're spending in that program as you highlighted."

Well, I think you said it well, Guy. It's very difficult for us to forecast in this area because typically, these unique opportunities are what we would classify as potential lost opportunities, meaning that if we don't act upon them, they're likely going to move away or at least the low-cost entry element of them will move away from us.  So it is difficult for us to forecast. That's one of the reasons why we at least attempted to provide some visibility into the next quarter for you all. So that was an important element. I think as we consider the scope of it and ensuring that we do apply discipline to this element of our business, just like all other elements of our business, it starts with return and capital allocation. When the rec's team brings in an opportunity, it has to compete on a similar basis as our other opportunities, meaning that there has to be a path there to achieve economics, full-cycle economics, that are competitive with our existing portfolio. These are still exploration plays with a finite chance of success. But we have to be able to see materiality, quality and value proposition, meaning that they can come in and compete for capital allocation. The other point that I would make just on the spend question is that as you think about the framework, although we're very excited about the greenfield leasing that we've accomplished, bear in mind that the real work comes after the leasing occurs. We have to get in there then and go through appraisal, delineation, and we hope it's ultimately predevelopment. And all of those activities will require capital allocation. So as we look forward in time, we have to also consider those future capital needs that are beyond just greenfield leasing."

Yes, first of all, I want to emphasize that return of capital to shareholders is and has been an ongoing dialogue with our board. We obviously discuss our dividend, which is very competitive in our space, with our board each and every quarter. So that concept of return of capital to shareholders and the constructive tension with other investment opportunities is front and center with the leadership and with our board each and every time we sit down to discuss it. What I would say is that, going back to my opening comments, that repurchasing shares is definitely an option. We have an authorization of $1.5 billion already in place. We can also consider the level of our dividend. Although at $170 million annually, it's very competitive, that also needs to go into the calculus. And you're right, I mean, we -- certainly, as we look ahead, we absolutely see the opportunity to get into a mode of sustainable cash -- free cash flow generation. And I think as we move through that, returning additional capital to shareholders will feature in that forward dialogue. I would maybe mention though just a few things there is that, first of all, we feel that we need kind of a minimum cash balance to run our business given the scale and scope of it of around $750 million of cash on hand, and that's plus or minus. I would also point out that all companies are at different stages in their respective business models. We have addressed our balance sheet very clearly last year. We've also largely completed our major portfolio dispositions, meaning that we don't expect additional near-term material proceeds. As I was just chatting about with Guy, we also recognize that leasing cost is just the first step in capturing some of the low-entry cost opportunities, so we must consider those future capital needs as well. All that to say is that the bottom line is that all of these factors go into our considerations for pursuing what is the best -- what are the best options for long-term value creation through the use of free cash. And I view it as it's not an either/or proposition. We see multiple uses for that, including enhancing our direct return of capital. All of that can be accommodated."

So that does go, and we look at obviously the product mix, but we're more driven by making sure that we're deploying to the correct overall economic value proposition. And today, when you look at our relative capital allocation that we described earlier in the year, it's not surprising that a big component of our capital allocation is flowing to both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while we progress the early development phases from a strategic standpoint certainly in both Northern Delaware and Oklahoma. So we feel that we have already accommodated that -- not only the oil cut but the overall economics that we see in the Bakken in our capital deployment. But again, as we get new data, we can always look at adjusting and redeploying within our multi-basin model. But I want to stress that the $2.3 billion is the development capital that we'll be working within."

I'll see if I can address that for you and I'll carry on and probably I'll hit what you're looking for. But maybe I'll start with breaking down acquisition a little bit just for context and in the slides. But 70% of our operated DSUs in the STACK are in the overpressured window, and about 30% in the normally pressured. And you'll note that for the remainder of 2018, our focus is really in the overpressured areas. How I would describe it is we completed our first phase of infills in the normally pressured window, the last one of course was the Cerny. The most recent one, which we did a multi-horizon test there, including in Meramec, Osage and Woodford. We've made a massive data set of production, subsurface and intentional data acquisition. We're now integrating that into the same kind of internally developed workflow, multidiscipline integration work flow that we've applied in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken to drive the results that you're seeing from us there. I would note and just kind of keep in mind, in those 2 basins we've got about on the order of 1,500 infills, whereas in the normally pressured window, we've got 19 infill locations so far. At a different phase, we have taken a few very significant learnings thus far and continue to optimize while we focus in the overpressured area and come back. But the Cerny Meramec wells were delivered, about $700,000 completed well cost lower than the Eves, and through the first 60 days, we're seeing oil [ cumes ] that are comparable. So no degradation in performance there. And we believe we can take costs down even further. We're currently evaluating the design that's more in the $3.5 million completed well cost range. So continuing to advance our learnings, more optimization to do. And while we're in that integration and calculation phase, we're going to shift our focus more into the overpressured area."

But I hope you will understand, we're not going to reveal sort of the full detailed recipe of how we're doing what we're doing. But I'll say it starts with the tremendous technical database that we've developed. The team that we have there really refining the multidiscipline integration of that and the reservoir characterization that allows us to then design a completion that takes advantage of the local characteristics. Supplement that with the culture that we've been building over the last few years, which is never to be satisfied with yesterday's results. And what it's taken us to is an approach that allows us to customize to a very subregional level. And if you'll look at our completion details across the basin, you'll very clearly see that we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach. We custom design to take advantage of what we understand about local characteristics. The Hector record -- record Three Forks well from Hector, the 2 West Myrmidon wells you mentioned, those records weren't delivered by accident. It's true that there was good rock to start with. But our completion designs were tailored to take advantage of the characteristics there. And so it's a value optimization focus that drives it and a really refined multidiscipline integration of those large database that we have."

Well, I certainly I believe that the $2.3 billion is a capital discipline and returns-driven choices that we are making. There's nothing intrinsic in either basin that is limiting us today from an activity standpoint. Obviously, we look to drive maximum efficiency, i.e. running our frac crews 24/7, et cetera. All those things come into play. But when I -- I think the way, again, to think about 2018 for both of those basins is Bakken is absolutely on a growth trajectory, but it's also going to generate free cash flow this year. Eagle Ford, we are managing to a more or less flat production profile in order to take advantage of its capital efficiency and ability to generate free cash flow to drive other elements of our portfolio. I think on your question around, you mentioned, inflation. Thus far, we feel that the inflation assumptions that were implicit in our original $2.3 billion plan are still holding true. And so we -- although it's something that our teams not only look to manage but actually look to offset each and every day, we feel very comfortable at this stage that we have that accounted for fully in our $2.3 billion development capital budget. 2019 is something that we're really not talking about quite yet. But obviously, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford as well as our other basins will all be part of a multi-basin optimization as we go into 2019. And we'll allocate capital based on the best available data when we go through our planning cycle. So nothing is locked in and there are no constraints around the Bakken and the Eagle Ford of today that would not allow us to flex those assets up or down."

After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and c",1171,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. 
After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and corporate cash returns at strip pricing. Our differentiated multi-basin model delivered strong 9% sequential U.S. oil growth. And our asset-level execution underpinned our confidence to raise our full year 2018 resource play guidance, while also steering to the upper end of our total company guidance, all of this with our $2.3 billion development capital budget unchanged. An important point to note is that our first quarter development CapEx is not ratable, due primarily to some higher working interest relative to the remainder of 2018 and other timing effects.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. We continue to expand the core of our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions through enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County, respectively, uplifting economics and inventory quality while generating significant free cash flow from both assets. Bakken grew production 7% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance setting new 30-day oil IP records in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. The June and Chauncey wells in West Myrmidon established new records for the basin and oil production, with an average IP30 of almost 3,500 barrels of oil per day. The Arkin well in the Hector area set a new Williston Basin record for the Three Forks formation at an IP30 of just over 3,000 barrels of oil per day. And just to underscore the compelling economics of this well, the Arkin has already achieved payout. 
Finally, a West Myrmidon well brought to sales late in the quarter achieved a remarkable IP24 of over 10,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, but has not yet achieved 30 days of production. In part because we continue to bring on these basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all North Dakota requirements and have the necessary flexibility to ensure no flow assurance issues as we continue to pursue this high-return program.
Eagle Ford held production flat sequentially and delivered results in Q1 that spanned the entirety of our acreage position. These included 11 outstanding wells in Atascosa County, with an average IP30 of over 1,600 oil equivalent barrels per day at an oil cut of 76%. The Eagle Ford continued its focus on enhanced completion designs and contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were above WTI.
Oklahoma and Northern Delaware began their shift to primarily multi-well pad drilling that will dominate the remainder of their 2018 programs. In Oklahoma, oil production grew 25% sequentially, primarily from outstanding base performance that included the Tan infill that came online late in the fourth quarter. We largely completed our STACK leasehold program in the first quarter and expect to be greater than 90% HBP-ed in the STACK by year-end. 
Looking ahead, 95% of our remaining 2018 wells to sales in Oklahoma will be in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP, the majority of which will come from 4 multi-well infills.
Northern Delaware, though still early in its development cycle, delivered wells across the Malaga, Red Hills and Ranger areas at an average IP30 of 1,460 oil equivalent barrels per day at 69% oil cut. Late in the quarter, we brought the first 2 Cypress infill wells online ahead of schedule and we'll report results once we have 30 days of production from the entire pilot. Additionally, in the last 6 months, we've added 165 risked gross co-op locations, with an average working interest of 65% through trades and a small bolt-on and continue to pursue opportunities that increase our working interest, generate more operative sections and provide more extended lateral optionality. 
It's difficult to speak about the Permian without addressing differentials and takeaway. We're currently benefiting from our Midland-Cushing basis swaps and open positions cover us for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discount of less than $1 to WTI for the second half of 2018 and all of 2019. Our swaps will help protect over half our forecasted oil production for the remainder of the year.
On takeaway, it is important to stress that today, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 4% of our overall production mix. However, while we anticipate no flow assurance issues, we are planning for future growth and have expanded our oil gathering agreements and are assessing both gas gathering and FT commitments for the longer term. We are also transitioning our water-to-pipe throughout the year, which will reduce unit operating costs for the basin. 
In addition to our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in Agee, which contributed $124 million of EBITDAX for the quarter despite a turnaround at the LNG plant. This unique gas infrastructure, LNG plant, gas plant, methanol plant, is well positioned to not only deliver free cash flow today but also could capture additional equity and third-party gas as the natural point of aggregation in the region.
Our financial flexibility is at the top of our peer group and was further strengthened by receipt of proceeds from Libya and our final Canadian oil sands payment. This flexibility allows us to pursue multiple high-return uses of free cash, but we are taking a disciplined approach and we are not considering large-scale M&A.
Repurchasing shares is an option, and we have a $1.5 billion authorization already in place. And we can also look at our already competitive $170 million annual dividend. We have enjoyed higher pricing for just over a quarter. But as our confidence in sustainable free cash flow generation continues to grow, we will consider returning additional capital to shareholders, and it is a topic of ongoing discussion with our board.
Our objective is to strike the right balance between additional direct return of capital and accretive opportunistic low-entry cost resource capture. Specifically, we have successfully added quality operated locations in the Northern Delaware through trades and a small bolt-on and have captured over 250,000 acres across multiple onshore exploration plays, including a material position in the emerging Louisiana Chalk at less than $900 an acre. We recognize that these unique resource capture opportunities are episodic and challenging to forecast. We spent $94 million in Q1 and expect another $150 million in Q2, but they offer the potential to generate outsized full cycle returns.
We now expect to grow resource plays 25% to 30% year-over-year, up from 20% to 25% for both oil and BOE, with our development capital budget unchanged. And we expect our total company annual growth to be toward the upper end of our guidance, also for both oil and BOE.
But growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. Thank you, and with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Guy, maybe just for everyone on the call, we have talked about the Bakken having a forward inventory at kind of current activity levels of just over 12 years.

We have had very strong early success there, record-setting wells there. But we're still marching across that acreage position. And I view this as, thus far, really providing us an opportunity to uplift the intrinsic value and economics of that 12 years of inventory as we elevate the inventory that resides within the Hector area. Additionally, we are still looking to test other areas this year in the Bakken, including Elk Creek as well as the Ajax area, as we continue to apply the same workflows that started in West Myrmidon, transitioned then into Hector.

Well, I think you said it well, Guy. It's very difficult for us to forecast in this area because typically, these unique opportunities are what we would classify as potential lost opportunities, meaning that if we don't act upon them, they're likely going to move away or at least the low-cost entry element of them will move away from us. So it is difficult for us to forecast. That's one of the reasons why we at least attempted to provide some visibility into the next quarter for you all. So that was an important element. I think as we consider the scope of it and ensuring that we do apply discipline to this element of our business, just like all other elements of our business, it starts with return and capital allocation. When the rec's team brings in an opportunity, it has to compete on a similar basis as our other opportunities, meaning that there has to be a path there to achieve economics, full-cycle economics, that are competitive with our existing portfolio. These are still exploration plays with a finite chance of success. But we have to be able to see materiality, quality and a value proposition, meaning that they can come in and compete for capital allocation. The other point that I would make just on the spend question is that as you think about the framework, although we're very excited about the greenfield leasing that we've accomplished, bear in mind that the real work comes after the leasing occurs. We have to get in there then and go through appraisal, delineation, and what we hope it's ultimately predevelopment. And all of those activities will require capital allocation. So as we look forward in time, we have to also consider those future capital needs that are beyond just greenfield leasing."

Yes, first of all, I want to emphasize that return of capital to shareholders is and has been an ongoing dialogue with our board. We obviously discuss our dividend, which is very competitive in our space, with our board each and every quarter. So that concept of return of capital to shareholders and the constructive tension with other investment opportunities is front and center with the leadership and with our board each and every time we sit down to discuss it. What I would say is that, going back to my opening comments, that repurchasing shares is definitely an option. We have an authorization of $1.5 million already in place. We can also consider the level of our dividend. Although at $170 million annually, it's very competitive. That also needs to go into the calculus. And you're right, I mean, we -- certainly, as we look ahead, we absolutely see the opportunity to get into a mode of sustainable cash -- free cash flow generation. And I think as we move through that, returning additional capital to shareholders will feature in that forward dialogue. I would maybe mention though just a few things there is that, first of all, we feel that we need kind of a minimum cash balance to run our business given the scale and scope of it of around $750 million of cash on hand, and that's plus or minus. I would also point out that all companies are at different stages in their respective business models. We have addressed our balance sheet very clearly last year. We've also largely completed our major portfolio dispositions, meaning that we don't expect additional near-term material proceeds. As I was just chatting about with Guy, we also recognize that leasing cost is just the first step in capturing some of these low-entry cost opportunities, so we must consider those future capital needs as well. All that to say is that the bottom line is that all of these factors go into our considerations for pursuing what is the best -- what are the best options for long-term value creation through the use of free cash. And I view it as it's not an either/or proposition. We see multiple uses for that, including enhancing our direct return of capital. All of that can be accommodated."

We look at obviously the product mix, but we're more driven by making sure that we're deploying to the correct overall economic value proposition. And today, when you look at our relative capital allocation that we described earlier in the year, it's not surprising that a big component of our capital allocation is flowing to both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while we progress the early development phases from a strategic standpoint certainly in both Northern Delaware and Oklahoma. So we feel that we have already accommodated that -- not only the oil cut but the overall economics that we see in the Bakken in our capital deployment. But again, as we get new data, we can always look at adjusting and redeploying within our multi-basin model.

I'll see if I can address that for you and then carry on if I'm not hitting what you're looking for. But maybe I'd start with breaking down our STACK position a little bit just for context and we put it in the slides. But 70% of our operated DSUs in the STACK are in the overpressured window, and about 30% in the normally pressured. And you'll note that for the remainder of 2018, our focus is really in the overpressured areas. How I would describe it is we completed our first phase of infills in the normally pressured window. The last one, of course, was the Cerny. The most recent one, which we did a multi-horizon test there, including in Meramec, Osage and Woodford. We've obtained a massive data set of production, subsurface and intentional data acquisition. We're now integrating that into the same kind of internally developed workflow, multidiscipline integration work flow that we've applied in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken to drive the results that you're seeing from us there. I would note and just kind of keep in mind, in those 2 basins we've got about on the order of 1,500 infills, whereas in the normally pressured window, we've got 19 infill locations so far. At a different phase, we have taken a few very significant learnings thus far and continue to optimize while we focus in the overpressured area and come back. But the Cerny Meramec wells were delivered, about $700,000 completed well cost lower than the Eves, and through the first 60 days, we're seeing oil [ cumes ] that are comparable. So no degradation in performance there. And we believe we can take costs down even further. We're currently evaluating the design that's more in the $3.5 million completed well cost range. So continuing to advance our learnings, more optimization to do. And while we're in that integration and compilation phase, we're going to shift our focus more into the overpressured area."

Supplement that with the culture that we've been building over the last few years, which is never to be satisfied with yesterday's results. And what it's taken us to is an approach that allows us to customize to a very subregional level. And if you'll look at our completion details across the basin, you'll very clearly see that we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach. We custom design to take advantage of what we understand about local characteristics. The Hector record -- record Three Forks well from Hector, the 2 West Myrmidon wells you mentioned, those records weren't delivered by accident. It's true that there was good rock to start with. But our completion designs were tailored to take advantage of the characteristics there.

And so we -- although it's something that our teams not only look to manage but actually look to offset each and every day, we feel very comfortable at this stage that we have that accounted for fully in our $2.3 billion development capital budget. 2019 is something that we're really not talking about quite yet. But obviously, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford as well as our other basins will all be part of a multi-basin optimization as we go into 2019. And we'll allocate capital based on the best available data when we go through our planning cycle. So nothing is locked in and there are no constraints around the Bakken and the Eagle Ford today that would not allow us to flex those assets up or down."

After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and c",1171,"Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. 
After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement and corporate cash returns at strip pricing. Our differentiated multi-basin model delivered strong 9% sequential U.S. oil growth. And our asset-level execution underpinned our confidence to raise our full year 2018 resource play guidance, while also steering to the upper end of our total company guidance, all of this with our $2.3 billion development capital budget unchanged. An important point to note is that our first quarter development CapEx is not ratable, due primarily to some higher working interest relative to the remainder of 2018 and other timing effects.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. We continue to expand the core of our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions through enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County, respectively, uplifting economics and inventory quality while generating significant free cash flow from both assets. Bakken grew production 7% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance setting new 30-day oil IP records in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. The June and Chauncey wells in West Myrmidon established new records for the basin and oil production, with an average IP30 of almost 3,500 barrels of oil per day. The Arkin well in the Hector area set a new Williston Basin record for the Three Forks formation at an IP30 of just over 3,000 barrels of oil per day. And just to underscore the compelling economics of this well, the Arkin has already achieved payout. 
Finally, a West Myrmidon well brought to sales late in the quarter achieved a remarkable IP24 of over 10,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, but has not yet achieved 30 days of production. In part because we continue to bring on these basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all North Dakota requirements and have the necessary flexibility to ensure no flow assurance issues as we continue to pursue this high-return program.
Eagle Ford held production flat sequentially and delivered results in Q1 that spanned the entirety of our acreage position. These included 11 outstanding wells in Atascosa County, with an average IP30 of over 1,600 oil equivalent barrels per day at an oil cut of 76%. The Eagle Ford continued its focus on enhanced completion designs and contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were above WTI.
Oklahoma and Northern Delaware began their shift to primarily multi-well pad drilling that will dominate the remainder of their 2018 programs. In Oklahoma, oil production grew 25% sequentially, primarily from outstanding base performance that included the Tan infill that came online late in the fourth quarter. We largely completed our STACK leasehold program in the first quarter and expect to be greater than 90% HBP-ed in the STACK by year-end. 
Looking ahead, 95% of our remaining 2018 wells to sales in Oklahoma will be in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP, the majority of which will come from 4 multi-well infills.
Northern Delaware, though still early in its development cycle, delivered wells across the Malaga, Red Hills and Ranger areas at an average IP30 of 1,460 oil equivalent barrels per day at 69% oil cut. Late in the quarter, we brought the first 2 Cypress infill wells online ahead of schedule and we'll report results once we have 30 days of production from the entire pilot. Additionally, in the last 6 months, we've added 165 risked gross co-op locations, with an average working interest of 65% through trades and a small bolt-on and continue to pursue opportunities that increase our working interest, generate more operative sections and provide more extended lateral optionality. 
It's difficult to speak about the Permian without addressing differentials and takeaway. We're currently benefiting from our Midland-Cushing basis swaps and open positions cover us for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discount of less than $1 to WTI for the second half of 2018 and all of 2019. Our swaps will help protect over half our forecasted oil production for the remainder of the year.
On takeaway, it is important to stress that today, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 4% of our overall production mix. However, while we anticipate no flow assurance issues, we are planning for future growth and have expanded our oil gathering agreements and are assessing both gas gathering and FT commitments for the longer term. We are also transitioning our water-to-pipe throughout the year, which will reduce unit operating costs for the basin. 
In addition to our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in Agee, which contributed $124 million of EBITDAX for the quarter despite a turnaround at the LNG plant. This unique gas infrastructure, LNG plant, gas plant, methanol plant, is well positioned to not only deliver free cash flow today but also could capture additional equity and third-party gas as the natural point of aggregation in the region.
Our financial flexibility is at the top of our peer group and was further strengthened by receipt of proceeds from Libya and our final Canadian oil sands payment. This flexibility allows us to pursue multiple high-return uses of free cash, but we are taking a disciplined approach and we are not considering large-scale M&A.
Repurchasing shares is an option, and we have a $1.5 billion authorization already in place. And we can also look at our already competitive $170 million annual dividend. We have enjoyed higher pricing for just over a quarter. But as our confidence in sustainable free cash flow generation continues to grow, we will consider returning additional capital to shareholders, and it is a topic of ongoing discussion with our board.
Our objective is to strike the right balance between additional direct return of capital and accretive opportunistic low-entry cost resource capture. Specifically, we have successfully added quality operated locations in the Northern Delaware through trades and a small bolt-on and have captured over 250,000 acres across multiple onshore exploration plays, including a material position in the emerging Louisiana Chalk at less than $900 an acre. We recognize that these unique resource capture opportunities are episodic and challenging to forecast. We spent $94 million in Q1 and expect another $150 million in Q2, but they offer the potential to generate outsized full cycle returns.
We now expect to grow resource plays 25% to 30% year-over-year, up from 20% to 25% for both oil and BOE, with our development capital budget unchanged. And we expect our total company annual growth to be toward the upper end of our guidance, also for both oil and BOE.
But growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. Thank you, and with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Guy, maybe just for everyone on the call, we have talked about the Bakken having a forward inventory at kind of current activity levels of just over 12 years. And the way I think about our success in the Hector today is that we're continuing to delineate across an acreage position there. That's about 115,000 net acres. We have had very strong early success there, record-setting wells there. But we're still marching across that acreage position. And I view this as, thus far, really providing us an opportunity to uplift the intrinsic value and economics of that 12 years of inventory as we elevate the inventory that resides within the Hector area. Additionally, we are still looking to test other areas this year in the Bakken, including Elk Creek as well as the Ajax area, as we continue to apply the same workflows that started in West Myrmidon, transitioned then into Hector. We're looking to apply those as well in these other areas. So right now, it's a great outcome. All credit to the team there for their innovation.

Well, I think you said it well, Guy. It's very difficult for us to forecast in this area because typically, these unique opportunities are what we would classify as potential lost opportunities, meaning that if we don't act upon them, they're likely going to move away or at least the low-cost entry element of them will move away from us. So it is difficult for us to forecast. That's one of the reasons why we at least attempted to provide some visibility into the next quarter for you all. So that was an important element. I think as we consider the scope of it and ensuring that we do apply discipline to this element of our business, just like all other elements of our business, it starts with return and capital allocation. When the rec's team brings in an opportunity, it has to compete on a similar basis as our other opportunities, meaning that there has to be a path there to achieve economics, full-cycle economics, that are competitive with our existing portfolio. These are still exploration plays with a finite chance of success. But we have to be able to see materiality, quality and a value proposition, meaning that they can come in and compete for capital allocation. The other point that I would make just on the spend question is that as you think about the framework, although we're very excited about the greenfield leasing that we've accomplished, bear in mind that the real work comes after the leasing occurs. We have to get in there then and go through appraisal, delineation, and what we hope it's ultimately predevelopment. And all of those activities will require capital allocation. So as we look forward in time, we have to also consider those future capital needs that are beyond just greenfield leasing."

Yes, first of all, I want to emphasize that return of capital to shareholders is and has been an ongoing dialogue with our board. We obviously discuss our dividend, which is very competitive in our space, with our board each and every quarter. So that concept of return of capital to shareholders and the constructive tension with other investment opportunities is front and center with the leadership and with our board each and every time we sit down to discuss it. What I would say is that, going back to my opening comments, that repurchasing shares is definitely an option. We have an authorization of $1.5 million already in place. We can also consider the level of our dividend. Although at $170 million annually, it's very competitive. That also needs to go into the calculus. And you're right, I mean, we -- certainly, as we look ahead, we absolutely see the opportunity to get into a mode of sustainable cash -- free cash flow generation. And I think as we move through that, returning additional capital to shareholders will feature in that forward dialogue. I would maybe mention though just a few things there is that, first of all, we feel that we need kind of a minimum cash balance to run our business given the scale and scope of it of around $750 million of cash on hand, and that's plus or minus. I would also point out that all companies are at different stages in their respective business models. We have addressed our balance sheet very clearly last year. We've also largely completed our major portfolio dispositions, meaning that we don't expect additional near-term material proceeds. As I was just chatting about with Guy, we also recognize that leasing cost is just the first step in capturing some of these low-entry cost opportunities, so we must consider those future capital needs as well. All that to say is that the bottom line is that all of these factors go into our considerations for pursuing what is the best -- what are the best options for long-term value creation through the use of free cash. And I view it as it's not an either/or proposition. We see multiple uses for that, including enhancing our direct return of capital. All of that can be accommodated."

But obviously, the Louisiana Austin Chalk, as you mentioned, did go through a bit of a development phase.

And you're right, the Bakken offers very high crude cut. But I would also point out that even in Atascosa County, we're riding upwards above 75% CNC crude oil cut there as well. So that does go in. We look at obviously the product mix, but we're more driven by making sure that we're deploying to the correct overall economic value proposition. And today, when you look at our relative capital allocation that we described earlier in the year, it's not surprising that a big component of our capital allocation is flowing to both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while we progress the early development phases from a strategic standpoint certainly in both Northern Delaware and Oklahoma. So we feel that we have already accommodated that -- not only the oil cut but the overall economics that we see in the Bakken in our capital deployment. But again, as we get new data, we can always look at adjusting and redeploying within our multi-basin model. But I want to stress that $2.3 billion is the development capital that we'll be working within."

I'll see if I can address that for you and then carry on if I'm not hitting what you're looking for. But maybe I'd start with breaking down our STACK position a little bit just for context and we put it in the slides. But 70% of our operated DSUs in the STACK are in the overpressured window, and about 30% in the normally pressured. And you'll note that for the remainder of 2018, our focus is really in the overpressured areas. How I would describe it is we completed our first phase of infills in the normally pressured window. The last one, of course, was the Cerny. The most recent one, which we did a multi-horizon test there, including in Meramec, Osage and Woodford. We've obtained a massive data set of production, subsurface and intentional data acquisition. We're now integrating that into the same kind of internally developed workflow, multidiscipline integration work flow that we've applied in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken to drive the results that you're seeing from us there. I would note and just kind of keep in mind, in those 2 basins we've got about on the order of 1,500 infills, whereas in the normally pressured window, we've got 19 infill locations so far. At a different phase, we have taken a few very significant learnings thus far and continue to optimize while we focus in the overpressured area and come back. But the Cerny Meramec wells were delivered, about $700,000 completed well cost lower than the Eves, and through the first 60 days, we're seeing oil [ cumes ] that are comparable. So no degradation in performance there. And we believe we can take costs down even further. We're currently evaluating the design that's more in the $3.5 million completed well cost range. So continuing to advance our learnings, more optimization to do. And while we're in that integration and compilation phase, we're going to shift our focus more into the overpressured area."

But I'll say it starts with the tremendous technical database that we've developed. The team that we have there really refining the multidiscipline integration of that and the reservoir characterization that allows us to then design a completion that takes advantage of the local characteristics. Supplement that with the culture that we've been building over the last few years, which is never to be satisfied with yesterday's results. And what it's taken us to is an approach that allows us to customize to a very subregional level. And if you'll look at our completion details across the basin, you'll very clearly see that we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach. We custom design to take advantage of what we understand about local characteristics. The Hector record -- record Three Forks well from Hector, the 2 West Myrmidon wells you mentioned, those records weren't delivered by accident. It's true that there was good rock to start with. But our completion designs were tailored to take advantage of the characteristics there. And so it's a value optimization focus that drives it and a really refined multidiscipline integration of the large database that we have."

There's nothing intrinsic in either basin that is limiting us today from an activity standpoint. Obviously, we look to drive maximum efficiency, i.e. running our frac crews 24/7, et cetera. All those things come into play. But when I -- I think the way, again, to think about 2018 for both of those basins is Bakken is absolutely on a growth trajectory, but it's also going to generate free cash flow this year. Eagle Ford, we are managing to a more or less flat production profile in order to take advantage of its capital efficiency and ability to generate free cash flow to drive other elements of our portfolio. I think on your question around -- you mentioned inflation. Thus far, we feel that the inflation assumptions that were implicit in our original $2.3 billion plan are still holding true. And so we -- although it's something that our teams not only look to manage but actually look to offset each and every day, we feel very comfortable at this stage that we have that accounted for fully in our $2.3 billion development capital budget. 2019 is something that we're really not talking about quite yet. But obviously, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford as well as our other basins will all be part of a multi-basin optimization as we go into 2019.

With half of the year behind us, our outstanding operational execution across our differentiated position, and the four best U.S. resource plays is driving improved corporate level returns and enabling us to exceed our production commitments for the quarter and for the full year.
Further compelling combination of better well performance and greater drilling and completion efficiencies, we've raised our guidance for annual improvement and corporate cash returns and cash flow for debt-adjusted share as well as annual oil and BOE production growth for total company and the U.S. resource plays.
All of this, with no change to our $2.3 billion development capital budget, and while adjusting for recently devastated noncore oil volumes. While development CapEx has been slightly weighted to the first half of the year, we expect to see our working interest moderate across the U.S. resource plays, consistent with the planned well mix for the second half of 2018.
Our outstanding operational execution, coupled with our capital discipline and higher oil prices, enabled us to generate about $250 million of organic free cash flow during the second quarter, building upon our already peer-leading financial visibility.
This developing trend enhances our confidence in sustainable free cash flow, and gives us ample room to progress multiple high-return uses of cash. The well options are on the table, our philosophy has not changed. It starts with the superior balance sheet and ensuring adequate cash on hand to run the business.
Continued discipline on our $2.3 billion development capital program, regardless of commodity pricing. Appropriately funding low-cost, high-quality resource play exploration with a goal of generating outsized full cycle returns.
Maintaining optionality around small bolt-on opportunities in the Northern Delaware and also in our other U.S. resource plays. Large M&A, however, is not our focus and returning cash to shareholders. We have a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place, and are already funding our existing $170 million annual dividend.
Our framework stresses the line of sight to sustainable free cash flow generation, while striking the right balance between low-cost resource structure and direct return of capital to shareholders.
In the current pricing environment, we are increasingly confident we can do both. We recognize that resource capture opportunities will be episodic, and will include greenfield lease income exploration drilling and seismic as well as small bolt-ons. As such, we must be prepared to act thoughtfully, but also quickly when such opportunities meet our criteria.
To that end, we spent about $250 million in the first half of 2018, predominantly on leasing and the emerging Austin Chalk plan in Louisiana, and expect another $100 million to 150 million of Rex CapEx in the second half of the year, when we'll spread our first exploration well in Louisiana.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. Impressive well results continue to confirm our expanded core in both our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Significantly enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County are uplifting economics and inventory quality, while both assets continue to generate significant free cash flow.
Bakken grew all production 14% sequentially, and continued its basin-leading performance with the wells in setting new basin oil records for the Three Forks, with average IP30's greater than 3,000 barrels of oil per day.
Our successful expansion of enhanced completion designs and to L creek elevates the economic returns for yet another area within our overall lease position. As we continue to bring on basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing against capture to remain in full compliance with all of North Dakota requirements, and expect no flow assurance issues as we continue to develop this high-return program.
Eagle Ford production grew 2% sequentially, with another quarter of consistent results from the 39 wells we brought to sales, which delivered average IP30 of about 1,900 BOE per day at the 66% oil cut. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in well performance, with 90-day cumulative production up 50% relative to 2016.
The Eagle Ford, again, contributed significant free cash flow through to the powerful combination of well performance and strong oil realizations that were once again about WTI. In Oklahoma, we're shipping from stacked leasehold protection to primarily multi-well pad development in both the overpressure STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That development focuses delivering results, with the SCOOP Woodford the 4 well pad on the half section, boasting an impressive IP30 of over 2,600 BOE per day from lateral links that average 6,800 feet.
Importantly, initial oil cuts exceeded expectations at almost 50%, placing these among some of the best Woodford oil wells in the play. There are Oklahoma wells for sale for first the half of the year, average remaining 2018 completions will come primarily from the overpressured STACK infills. The majority of the team's activity in the second half of the year will be focused on drilling multi-well infill pads that won't come to sale until 2019.
In the Northern Delaware, we made great progress capturing drilling and completion efficiencies., including a 45% improvement in average drilling feet per day since the fourth quarter, and averaging 9 frac stages per day on the 3 wells pad. This efficiencies allowed us to move from 5 to 4 rigs in June, while maintaining our original 2018 guidance of 50 to 55 wells for sales.
On Takeaway. Though an important growth asset, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 5% of our production mix for the quarter, but we are already advancing midstream solutions that be on protecting flow assurance, maximize margins through enhanced realizations and LOE reduction. Specifically, we have expanded our oil gathering agreements and are finalizing our term oil sales agreement. And we just recently executed our water handling agreement in the area that will significantly reduce our unit LOE.
All of this is supported by our Midland Cushing basin hedges at a discount of less than a $1 to WTI. Outside of our 4 for U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in which contributed over $190 million of EBITDAX for the quarter.
Also, in Q2, we executed to process backfill gas from the field through our LNG plant on the Oklahoma. We continue to view our infrastructure as being uniquely positioned to become the natural point of aggregation in the region to capture additional equity and a third-party gas.
I always said that we'll never be done with portfolio management. And along those lines, we recently closed on the sale of 3 noncore, non-operated conventional assets in the U.S. These assets contributed 5,000 BOE per day in the first half of the year, and we are about 75% oil.
Even with these volume suggested out, we still raised total company 2018 oil and BOE guidance. We are also on track to fully stand before year-end, representing our eighth country exit since 2013. Second quarter has again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin business model. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities without being forced to accelerate into headwinds.
We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, with a 70% annual improvement in corporate cash returns at strip, while also delivering free cash flow. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on consistent execution, while managing those elements of our business within our control: balance sheet, cost structure portfolio simplification, that collectively generate compelling corporate returns with profitable growth and outcome. Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

So I just wanted to say congratulations on a great quarter. I did want to make a couple of questions regarding the cadence of your relative activity into the bottoms of this year and into next. First of all, in the Bakken, I want to go 2 questions by the way. First one in the Bakken, it looks like you've got quite wide range of variability across those Three Forks wells. I'm just wondering if you could touch on what's driving tremendous wells in one hand, but obviously got some wells at the other end of the spectrum as well. So what's driving the difference in completion? What's be the underlying claim rate ESP strategy? And just give us some idea of how we you see the cadence of the Bakken over next let's say, through the plan through 2020?"

Per our plan this year, we are going to have a bit of waiting from of wells to sales standpoint in the fourth quarter. So you should expect to see that as the year plays out. From an overall activity standpoint, we continue to try to maintain a level of activity that optimizes, if you will, the continuity in our both on the drilling and the completion side and the Bakken. Now with the success though that we have seen, particularly in the Hector area and certainly not only the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to be very encouraged about what Bakken activity might look like as we begin planning for 2019. And in terms of variability, and I'll let Mitch may be chime in a little bit on that, we are going to see some natural variability across the play as the geology varies. But having said that, I think when you look at the consistent outperformance using our enhanced completion designs, that is very much a common element. And then from an artificial lift perspective, we continue to take full advantage of the best available technology. We think managing the life of the well is equally as important, as generating early IP30s. And so our team and the asset is very focused on how best to optimize using not only ESPs, but also other forms of artificial lift. So with that, may be Mitch if you want to chime in anything else, just on the Three Forks specifically?"

What I would say is we've talked about before the tremendous technical database that we have here, and the integrated workflow that we have applied on a subregional basis to optimize across the play. Lee aptly noted, we do see some geological variation across the play, and we've also talked in the past about instilling a culture where we're never satisfied with yesterday's results. So we still continue to trial various designs, which would alter pumping strategy, proppant loading and technology. And so some of the variability is driven by those trials as we look to optimize on a return basis across the entire play. But in aggregate, with the expansion of the core into Hector and now Creek, when you look at the performance in aggregate being up over 100% since 2016, I feel good about the capability and the commitment of the team there to continue to drive further improvements."

I say incremental because, of course, we still do have within our peer group is still a very competitive dividend that we are paying. I think as we continue to gain that confidence and see this trend, it really started in earnest this quarter with $250 million of organic cash flow. And we used organic cash flow because we think that's more indicative of the underlying performance of the business. But as we look at that and gain that confidence and look out in time, I think we're getting more comfortable that we can accommodate not only the needs we have in resource capture, but also looking at options to return directly to shareholders.

You're getting new cost data, you're getting new realization data each and everyday. So our planning processes, we have completely overhauled now to reflect the realities of the unconventional plays, which means capital allocation is no longer once a year exercise. It's something that we do in realtime. And so you should expect to see us continue to adjust and flex as we see developments in each of the individual basins. And whether that's some type of dislocation from a realization standpoint or some kind of dislocation even on a cost standpoint, we do have the ability to reflect that in our allocations going forward. There is little though that when you look at some a like a Bakken, where you had the combination of both productivity gains, strong realizations and continual reduction in the cost structure that those barrels are going to be extremely competitive even within a multi-basin model. And that's why you see us driving a lot of capital in that direction in this year's plan. So that was our perspective when we started the year.

With half of the year behind us, our outstanding operational execution across our differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays is driving improved corporate level returns and enabling us to exceed our production commitments for the quarter and for the full year.
Through the compelling combination of better well performance and greater drilling and completion efficiencies, we've raised our guidance for annual improvement and corporate cash returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share as well as annual oil and BOE production growth for total company and the U.S. resource plays. All of this, with no change to our $2.3 billion development capital budget, and while adjusting for recently divested noncore oil volumes.
While development CapEx has been slightly weighted to the first half of the year, we expect to see our working interest moderate across the U.S. resource plays, consistent with the planned well mix for the second half of 2018.
Our outstanding operational execution, coupled with our capital discipline and higher oil prices, enabled us to generate about $250 million of organic free cash flow during the second quarter, building upon our already peer-leading financial flexibility. This developing trend enhances our confidence in sustainable free cash flow and gives us ample room to progress multiple high-return uses of cash.
Though well options are on the table, our philosophy has not changed. It starts with a superior balance sheet and ensuring adequate cash on hand to run the business; continued discipline on our $2.3 billion development capital program, regardless of commodity pricing; appropriately funding low-cost, high-quality resource play exploration with a goal of generating outsized full cycle returns; maintaining optionality around small bolt-on opportunities in the Northern Delaware and also in our other U.S. resource plays, large M&A, however, is not our focus; and returning cash to shareholders.
We have a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place and are already funding our existing $170 million annual dividend. Our framework stresses line of sight to sustainable free cash flow generation, while striking the right balance between low-cost resource capture and direct return of capital to shareholders. In the current pricing environment, we are increasingly confident we can do both. We recognize that resource capture opportunities will be episodic and will include greenfield leasing, exploration drilling and seismic as well as small bolt-ons. As such, we must be prepared to act thoughtfully, but also quickly when such opportunities meet our criteria.
To that end, we spent about $250 million in the first half of 2018, predominantly on leasing in the emerging Austin Chalk play in Louisiana, and expect another $100 million to $150 million of REx CapEx in the second half of the year, when we'll spud our first exploration well in Louisiana.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. Impressive well results continue to confirm our expanded core in both our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Significantly enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County are uplifting economics and inventory quality, while both assets continue to generate significant free cash flow.
Bakken grew oil production 14% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance with the Winona and Mamie wells in West Myrmidon, setting new basin oil records for the Three Forks, with average IP30s greater than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Our successful expansion of enhanced completion designs into Elk Creek elevates the economic returns for yet another area within our overall lease position.
As we continue to bring on basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all of North Dakota requirements, and expect no flow assurance issues as we continue to develop this high-return program.
Eagle Ford production grew 2% sequentially, with another quarter of consistent results from the 39 wells we brought to sales, which delivered average IP30s of about 1,900 BOE per day at a 66% oil cut. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in well performance, with 90-day cumulative production up 50% relative to 2016. The Eagle Ford, again, contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were once again above WTI.
In Oklahoma, we are shifting from stacked leasehold protection to primarily multi-well pad development in both the overpressured STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That development focuses delivering results, with the SCOOP Woodford infill, the 4-well Lightner pad on a half section, boasting an impressive IP30 of over 2,600 BOE per day from lateral links that average 6,800 feet. Importantly, initial oil cuts exceeded expectations at almost 50%, placing these among some of the best Woodford oil wells in the play.
Though our Oklahoma wells to sales were weighted to the first half of the year, our remaining 2018 completions will come primarily from the Irven John and HR Potter overpressured STACK infills. The majority of the team's activity in the second half of the year will be focused on drilling multi-well infill pads that won't come to sales until 2019.
In the Northern Delaware, we made great progress capturing drilling and completion efficiencies, including a 45% improvement in average drilling feet per day since the fourth quarter, and averaging 9 frac stages per day on the 3-well Fiddle Fee pad. These efficiencies allowed us to move from 5 to 4 rigs in June, while maintaining our original 2018 guidance of 50 to 55 wells to sales.
On takeaway. Though an important growth asset, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 5% of our production mix for the quarter, but we are already advancing midstream solutions that beyond protecting flow assurance, maximize margins through enhanced realizations and LOE reduction. Specifically, we have expanded our oil-gathering agreements and are finalizing a term oil sales agreement. And we just recently executed a water-handling agreement in the Malaga area that will significantly reduce our unit LOE. All of this is supported by our Midland-Cushing basis hedges at a discount of less than a $1 to WTI.
Outside of our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed over $190 million of EBITDAX for the quarter.
Also in Q2, we executed an HOA to process backfill gas from the Alen field through our LNG plant on Bioko Island. We continue to view our EG infrastructure as being uniquely positioned to become the natural point of aggregation in the region to capture additional equity and a third-party gas.
I've always said that we'll never be done with portfolio management. And along those lines, we recently closed on the sale of 3 noncore, nonoperated conventional assets in the U.S. These assets contributed 5,000 BOE per day in the first half of the year, and were about 75% oil. Even with these volumes adjusted out, we still raised total company 2018 oil and BOE guidance. We are also on track to fully exit Kurdistan before year-end, representing our eighth country exit since 2013.
Second quarter has again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven, multi-basin business model. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities without being forced to accelerate into headwinds. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, with a 70% annual improvement in corporate cash returns at strip, while also delivering free cash flow. In the second half of the year, we'll continue to focus on consistent execution, while managing those elements of our business within our control: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio simplification, that collectively generate compelling corporate returns with profitable growth and outcome.
Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

I'm just wondering if you can touch on what's driving, I mean, tremendous wells on one hand, but, obviously, you've got some wells at the other end of the spectrum as well. So what's driving the differences in completion? What's happening to the underlying claim rate with your ESP strategy?

Per our plan this year, we are going to have a bit of waiting from a wells-to-sales standpoint in the fourth quarter. So you should expect to see that as the year plays out. From an overall activity standpoint, we continue to try to maintain a level of activity that optimizes, if you will, the continuity and our crews both on the drilling and the completion side in the Bakken. With the success though that we have seen, particularly in the Hector area and certainly not only the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to be very encouraged about what Bakken activity might look like as we begin planning for 2019. And in terms of variability, and I'll let Mitch maybe chime in a little bit on that, we are going to see some natural variability across the play as the geology varies. But having said that, I think when you look at the consistent outperformance using our enhanced completion design, that is very much a common element. And then from an artificial lift perspective, we continue to take full advantage of the best available technology. We think managing the life of the well is equally as important as generating early IP30s. And so our team and the asset is very focused on how best to optimize using not only ESPs, but also other forms of artificial lift. So with that, maybe Mitch, if you want to chime in anything else, just on the Three Forks specifically?"

I think, Lee covered it at a high level pretty well. What I would say is we've talked about before the tremendous technical database that we have here, and the integrated workflow that we've applied on a subregional basis to optimize across the play. Lee aptly noted, we do see some geologic variation across the play, and we've also talked in the past about instilling a culture where we're never satisfied with yesterday's results. So we still continue to trial various designs, which would alter pumping strategy, proppant loading and diversion technology. And so some of the variability is driven by those trials as we look to optimize on a return basis across the entire play. But in aggregate, with the expansion of the core into Hector and now Elk Creek, when you look at performance in aggregate being up over 100% since 2016, I feel good about the capability and the commitment of the team there to continue to drive further improvements."

I think coming back to what are we looking for, I think we've been very consistent in the messaging there, which has been around, we want to see sustainable free cash flow being generated from our model before looking at incremental direct return of capital to our shareholders. And I say incremental, because, of course, we do still have, what, within our peer group, is still a very competitive dividend that we're paying. I think as we continue to gain that confidence and see this trend, it really started in earnest this quarter with $250 million of organic cash flow. And we used organic cash flow because we think that's more indicative of the underlying performance of the business. But as we look at that and gain that confidence and look out in time, I think we're getting more comfortable that we can accommodate not only the needs we have in resource capture, but also looking at options to return directly to shareholders.

You're getting new cost data, you're getting new realization data each and every day. So our planning processes, we've completely overhauled them to reflect the realities of the unconventional plays, which means capital allocation is no longer once-a-year exercise. It's something that we do in real time. And so you should expect to see us continue to adjust and flex as we see developments in each of the individual basins. And whether that's some type of dislocation from a realization standpoint or some kind of dislocation even on a cost standpoint, we do have the ability to reflect that in our allocations going forward. There's little doubt though that when you look at somewhere like a Bakken, where you've had the combination of both productivity gains, strong realizations and continued reduction in the cost structure that those barrels are going to be extremely competitive even within our multi-basin model, and that's why you see us driving a lot of capital in that direction in this year's plan. So that was our perspective when we started the year. I think the -- probably the pleasant surprise for us has been the sheer outperformance what had traditionally been these noncore areas, like Hector, and seeing them compete head to head with the Tier 1 inventory that we have across all of our basins."

With half of the year behind us, our outstanding operational execution across our differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays is driving improved corporate level returns and enabling us to exceed our production commitments for the quarter and for the full year.
Through the compelling combination of better well performance and greater drilling and completion efficiencies, we've raised our guidance for annual improvement and corporate cash returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share as well as annual oil and BOE production growth for total company and the U.S. resource plays. All of this, with no change to our $2.3 billion development capital budget, and while adjusting for recently divested noncore oil volumes.
While development CapEx has been slightly weighted to the first half of the year, we expect to see our working interest moderate across the U.S. resource plays, consistent with the planned well mix for the second half of 2018.
Our outstanding operational execution, coupled with our capital discipline and higher oil prices, enabled us to generate about $250 million of organic free cash flow during the second quarter, building upon our already peer-leading financial flexibility. This developing trend enhances our confidence in sustainable free cash flow and gives us ample room to progress multiple high-return uses of cash.
Though well options are on the table, our philosophy has not changed. It starts with a superior balance sheet and ensuring adequate cash on hand to run the business; continued discipline on our $2.3 billion development capital program, regardless of commodity pricing; appropriately funding low-cost, high-quality resource play exploration with a goal of generating outsized full cycle returns; maintaining optionality around small bolt-on opportunities in the Northern Delaware and also in our other U.S. resource plays, large M&A, however, is not our focus; and returning cash to shareholders.
We have a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place and are already funding our existing $170 million annual dividend. Our framework stresses line of sight to sustainable free cash flow generation, while striking the right balance between low-cost resource capture and direct return of capital to shareholders. In the current pricing environment, we are increasingly confident we can do both. We recognize that resource capture opportunities will be episodic and will include greenfield leasing, exploration drilling and seismic as well as small bolt-ons. As such, we must be prepared to act thoughtfully, but also quickly when such opportunities meet our criteria.
To that end, we spent about $250 million in the first half of 2018, predominantly on leasing in the emerging Austin Chalk play in Louisiana, and expect another $100 million to $150 million of REx CapEx in the second half of the year, when we'll spud our first exploration well in Louisiana.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. Impressive well results continue to confirm our expanded core in both our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Significantly enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County are uplifting economics and inventory quality, while both assets continue to generate significant free cash flow.
Bakken grew oil production 14% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance with the Winona and Mamie wells in West Myrmidon, setting new basin oil records for the Three Forks, with average IP30s greater than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Our successful expansion of enhanced completion designs into Elk Creek elevates the economic returns for yet another area within our overall lease position.
As we continue to bring on basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all of North Dakota requirements, and expect no flow assurance issues as we continue to develop this high-return program.
Eagle Ford production grew 2% sequentially, with another quarter of consistent results from the 39 wells we brought to sales, which delivered average IP30s of about 1,900 BOE per day at a 66% oil cut. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in well performance, with 90-day cumulative production up 50% relative to 2016. The Eagle Ford, again, contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were once again above WTI.
In Oklahoma, we are shifting from STACK leasehold protection to primarily multi-well pad development in both the overpressured STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That development focuses delivering results, with the SCOOP Woodford infill, the 4-well Lightner pad on a half section, boasting an impressive IP30 of over 2,600 BOE per day from lateral links that average 6,800 feet. Importantly, initial oil cuts exceeded expectations at almost 50%, placing these among some of the best Woodford oil wells in the play.
Though our Oklahoma wells to sales were weighted to the first half of the year, our remaining 2018 completions will come primarily from the Irven John and HR Potter overpressured STACK infills. The majority of the team's activity in the second half of the year will be focused on drilling multi-well infill pads that won't come to sales until 2019.
In the Northern Delaware, we've made great progress capturing drilling and completion efficiencies, including a 45% improvement in average drilling feet per day since the fourth quarter, and averaging 9 frac stages per day on the 3-well Fiddle Fee pad. These efficiencies allowed us to move from 5 to 4 rigs in June, while maintaining our original 2018 guidance of 50 to 55 wells to sales.
On takeaway. Though an important growth asset, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 5% of our production mix for the quarter, but we are already advancing midstream solutions that beyond protecting flow assurance, maximize margins through enhanced realizations and LOE reduction. Specifically, we have expanded our oil-gathering agreements and are finalizing a term oil sales agreement. And we just recently executed a water-handling agreement in the Malaga area that will significantly reduce our unit LOE. All of this is supported by our Midland-Cushing basis hedges at a discount of less than a $1 to WTI.
Outside of our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in E.G., which contributed over $190 million of EBITDAX for the quarter.
Also, in Q2, we executed an HOA to process backfill gas from the Alen field through our LNG plant on Bioko Island. We continue to view our E.G. infrastructure as being uniquely positioned to become the natural point of aggregation in the region to capture additional equity and a third-party gas.
I've always said that we'll never be done with portfolio management. And along those lines, we recently closed on the sale of 3 noncore, nonoperated conventional assets in the U.S. These assets contributed 5,000 BOE per day in the first half of the year, and were about 75% oil. Even with these volumes adjusted out, we still raised total company 2018 oil and BOE guidance. We are also on track to fully exit Kurdistan before year-end, representing our eighth country exit since 2013.
Second quarter has again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven, multi-basin business model. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities without being forced to accelerate into headwinds. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, with a 70% annual improvement in corporate cash returns at strip, while also delivering free cash flow. In the second half of the year, we'll continue to focus on consistent execution, while managing those elements of our business within our control: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio simplification; that collectively generate compelling corporate returns with profitable growth and outcome.
Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Per our plan this year, we are going to have a bit of waiting from a wells-to-sales standpoint in the fourth quarter. So you should expect to see that as the year plays out. From an overall activity standpoint, we continue to try to maintain a level of activity that optimizes, if you will, the continuity in our crews both on the drilling and the completion side in the Bakken. With the success though that we have seen, particularly in the Hector area, and certainly, and not only the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to be very encouraged about what Bakken activity might look like as we begin planning for 2019. And in terms of variability, and I'll let Mitch maybe chime in a little bit on that, we are going to see some natural variability across the play as the geology varies. But having said that, I think when you look at the consistent outperformance using our enhanced completion design, that is very much a common element. And then from an artificial lift perspective, we continue to take full advantage of the best available technology. We think managing the life of the well is equally as important as generating early IP30s. And so our team and the asset is very focused on how best to optimize using not only ESPs, but also other forms of artificial lift. So with that, maybe Mitch, if you want to chime in anything else, just on the Three Forks specifically?"

I think, Lee covered it at a high level pretty well. What I would say is we've talked about before the tremendous technical database that we have here, and the integrated workflow that we've applied on a subregional basis to optimize across the play. Lee aptly noted, we do see some geologic variation across the play, and we've also talked in the past about instilling a culture where we're never satisfied with yesterday's results. So we still continue to trial various designs, which would alter pumping strategy, proppant loading and diversion technology. And so some of the variability is driven by those trials as we look to optimize on a return basis across the entire play. But in aggregate, with the expansion of the core in the Hector and now Elk Creek, when you look at performance in aggregate being up over 100% since 2016, I feel good about the capability and the commitment of the team there to continue to drive further improvements."

I think coming back to what are we looking for, I think we've been very consistent in the messaging there, which has been around, we want to see sustainable free cash flow being generated from our model before looking at incremental direct return of capital to our shareholders. And I say incremental, because, of course, we do still have, what, within our peer group, is still a very competitive dividend that we're paying. I think as we continue to gain that confidence and see this trend, it really started in earnest this quarter with $250 million of organic cash flow. And we used organic cash flow because we think that's more indicative of the underlying performance of the business. But as we look at that and gain that confidence and look out in time, I think we're getting more comfortable that we can accommodate not only the needs we have in resource capture, but also looking at options to return directly to shareholders.

It feels perhaps like the Bakken is much more attractive now based on transport differentials. It feels like Oklahoma might be dropping off a bit geologically.

There are a lot of different factors that go in. Obviously, you're getting new performance data each and every day. You're getting new cost data, you're getting new realization data each and every day. So our planning processes, we've completely overhauled them to reflect the realities of the unconventional plays, which means capital allocation is no longer a once-a-year exercise. It's something that we do in real time. And so you should expect to see us continue to adjust and flex as we see developments in each of the individual basins. And whether that's some type of dislocation from a realization standpoint or some kind of dislocation even on a cost standpoint, we do have the ability to reflect that in our allocations going forward. There's little doubt though that when you look at somewhere like a Bakken, where you've had the combination of both productivity gains, strong realizations and continued reduction in the cost structure that those barrels are going to be extremely competitive even within our multi-basin model, and that's why you see us driving a lot of capital out that direction in this year's plan. So that was our perspective when we started the year. I think the -- probably the pleasant surprise for us has been the sheer outperformance of what had traditionally been these noncore areas, like Hector, and seeing them compete head to head with the Tier 1 inventory that we have across all of our basins."

With half of the year behind us, our outstanding operational execution across our differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays is driving improved corporate level returns and enabling us to exceed our production commitments for the quarter and for the full year.
Through the compelling combination of better well performance and greater drilling and completion efficiencies, we've raised our guidance for annual improvement and corporate cash returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share as well as annual oil and BOE production growth for total company and the U.S. resource plays. All of this, with no change to our $2.3 billion development capital budget, and while adjusting for recently divested noncore oil volumes.
While development CapEx has been slightly weighted to the first half of the year, we expect to see our working interest moderate across the U.S. resource plays, consistent with the planned well mix for the second half of 2018.
Our outstanding operational execution, coupled with our capital discipline and higher oil prices, enabled us to generate about $250 million of organic free cash flow during the second quarter, building upon our already peer-leading financial flexibility. This developing trend enhances our confidence in sustainable free cash flow and gives us ample room to progress multiple high-return uses of cash.
Though well options are on the table, our philosophy has not changed. It starts with a superior balance sheet and ensuring adequate cash on hand to run the business; continued discipline on our $2.3 billion development capital program, regardless of commodity pricing; appropriately funding low-cost, high-quality resource play exploration with a goal of generating outsized full cycle returns; maintaining optionality around small bolt-on opportunities in the Northern Delaware and also in our other U.S. resource plays, large M&A, however, is not our focus; and returning cash to shareholders.
We have a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place and are already funding our existing $170 million annual dividend. Our framework stresses line of sight to sustainable free cash flow generation, while striking the right balance between low-cost resource capture and direct return of capital to shareholders. In the current pricing environment, we are increasingly confident we can do both. We recognize that resource capture opportunities will be episodic and will include greenfield leasing, exploration drilling and seismic as well as small bolt-ons. As such, we must be prepared to act thoughtfully, but also quickly when such opportunities meet our criteria.
To that end, we spent about $250 million in the first half of 2018, predominantly on leasing in the emerging Austin Chalk play in Louisiana, and expect another $100 million to $150 million of REx CapEx in the second half of the year, when we'll spud our first exploration well in Louisiana.
Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. Impressive well results continue to confirm our expanded core in both our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Significantly enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County are uplifting economics and inventory quality, while both assets continue to generate significant free cash flow.
Bakken grew oil production 14% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance with the Winona and Mamie wells in West Myrmidon, setting new basin oil records for the Three Forks, with average IP30s greater than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Our successful expansion of enhanced completion designs into Elk Creek elevates the economic returns for yet another area within our overall lease position.
As we continue to bring on basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all of North Dakota requirements, and expect no flow assurance issues as we continue to develop this high-return program.
Eagle Ford production grew 2% sequentially, with another quarter of consistent results from the 39 wells we brought to sales, which delivered average IP30s of about 1,900 BOE per day at a 66% oil cut. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in well performance, with 90-day cumulative production up 50% relative to 2016. The Eagle Ford, again, contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were once again above WTI.
In Oklahoma, we are shifting from STACK leasehold protection to primarily multi-well pad development in both the overpressured STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That development focuses delivering results, with the SCOOP Woodford infill, the 4-well Lightner pad on a half section, boasting an impressive IP30 of over 2,600 BOE per day from lateral links that average 6,800 feet. Importantly, initial oil cuts exceeded expectations at almost 50%, placing these among some of the best Woodford oil wells in the play.
Though our Oklahoma wells to sales were weighted to the first half of the year, our remaining 2018 completions will come primarily from the Irven John and HR Potter overpressured STACK infills. The majority of the team's activity in the second half of the year will be focused on drilling multi-well infill pads that won't come to sales until 2019.
In the Northern Delaware, we've made great progress capturing drilling and completion efficiencies, including a 45% improvement in average drilling feet per day since the fourth quarter, and averaging 9 frac stages per day on the 3-well Fiddle Fee pad. These efficiencies allowed us to move from 5 to 4 rigs in June, while maintaining our original 2018 guidance of 50 to 55 wells to sales.
On takeaway. Though an important growth asset, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 5% of our production mix for the quarter, but we are already advancing midstream solutions that beyond protecting flow assurance, maximize margins through enhanced realizations and LOE reduction. Specifically, we have expanded our oil-gathering agreements and are finalizing a term oil sales agreement. And we just recently executed a water-handling agreement in the Malaga area that will significantly reduce our unit LOE. All of this is supported by our Midland-Cushing basis hedges at a discount of less than a $1 to WTI.
Outside of our 4 U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in E.G., which contributed over $190 million of EBITDAX for the quarter.
Also, in Q2, we executed an HOA to process backfill gas from the Alen field through our LNG plant on Bioko Island. We continue to view our E.G. infrastructure as being uniquely positioned to become the natural point of aggregation in the region to capture additional equity and a third-party gas.
I've always said that we'll never be done with portfolio management. And along those lines, we recently closed on the sale of 3 noncore, nonoperated conventional assets in the U.S. These assets contributed 5,000 BOE per day in the first half of the year, and were about 75% oil. Even with these volumes adjusted out, we still raised total company 2018 oil and BOE guidance. We are also on track to fully exit Kurdistan before year-end, representing our eighth country exit since 2013.
Second quarter has again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven, multi-basin business model. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities without being forced to accelerate into headwinds. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, with a 70% annual improvement in corporate cash returns at strip, while also delivering free cash flow. In the second half of the year, we'll continue to focus on consistent execution, while managing those elements of our business within our control: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio simplification; that collectively generate compelling corporate returns with profitable growth and outcome.
Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Per our plan this year, we are going to have a bit of waiting from a wells-to-sales standpoint in the fourth quarter. So you should expect to see that as the year plays out. From an overall activity standpoint, we continue to try to maintain a level of activity that optimizes, if you will, the continuity in our crews both on the drilling and the completion side in the Bakken. With the success though that we have seen, particularly in the Hector area, and certainly, and not only the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to be very encouraged about what Bakken activity might look like as we begin planning for 2019. And in terms of variability, and I'll let Mitch maybe chime in a little bit on that, we are going to see some natural variability across the play as the geology varies. But having said that, I think when you look at the consistent outperformance using our enhanced completion design, that is very much a common element. And then from an artificial lift perspective, we continue to take full advantage of the best available technology. We think managing the life of the well is equally as important as generating early IP30s. And so our team and the asset is very focused on how best to optimize using not only ESPs, but also other forms of artificial lift. So with that, maybe Mitch, if you want to chime in anything else, just on the Three Forks specifically?"

I think, Lee covered it at a high level pretty well. What I would say is we've talked about before the tremendous technical database that we have here, and the integrated workflow that we've applied on a subregional basis to optimize across the play. Lee aptly noted, we do see some geologic variation across the play, and we've also talked in the past about instilling a culture where we're never satisfied with yesterday's results. So we still continue to trial various designs, which would alter pumping strategy, proppant loading and diversion technology. And so some of the variability is driven by those trials as we look to optimize on a return basis across the entire play. But in aggregate, with the expansion of the core in the Hector and now Elk Creek, when you look at performance in aggregate being up over 100% since 2016, I feel good about the capability and the commitment of the team there to continue to drive further improvements."

I think coming back to what are we looking for, I think we've been very consistent in the messaging there, which has been around, we want to see sustainable free cash flow being generated from our model before looking at incremental direct return of capital to our shareholders. And I say incremental, because, of course, we do still have, what, within our peer group, is still a very competitive dividend that we're paying. I think as we continue to gain that confidence and see this trend, it really started in earnest this quarter with $250 million of organic cash flow. And we used organic cash flow because we think that's more indicative of the underlying performance of the business. But as we look at that and gain that confidence and look out in time, I think we're getting more comfortable that we can accommodate not only the needs we have in resource capture, but also looking at options to return directly to shareholders.

It's not as aerially extensive as what you would see in Hector. But what it does is it continues to confirm our ability to go in and not only predict performance, but be successful at delivering against that prediction. I think what we want to think about though is that we have 2 very key tests coming up in the remainder of the year. One of those is pushing further south in our Hector acreage, more to the south of that place. So we feel very good about the northern part of Hector and feel that we have essentially derisked that and moved it into the core. But we do have a test to the south. And then the other test, of course, will be in the Ajax area. And both of those tests will be later in the second half of the year."

So -- and that way it's very similar to places like Oklahoma and South Texas, where even though we brought in the unconventionals, there was a conventional business there that kind of came in before us.

There are a lot of different factors that go in. Obviously, you're getting new performance data each and every day. You're getting new cost data, you're getting new realization data each and every day. So our planning processes, we've completely overhauled them to reflect the realities of the unconventional plays, which means capital allocation is no longer a once-a-year exercise. It's something that we do in real time. And so you should expect to see us continue to adjust and flex as we see developments in each of the individual basins. And whether that's some type of dislocation from a realization standpoint or some kind of dislocation even on a cost standpoint, we do have the ability to reflect that in our allocations going forward. There's little doubt though that when you look at somewhere like a Bakken, where you've had the combination of both productivity gains, strong realizations and continued reduction in the cost structure that those barrels are going to be extremely competitive even within our multi-basin model, and that's why you see us driving a lot of capital out that direction in this year's plan. So that was our perspective when we started the year. I think the -- probably the pleasant surprise for us has been the sheer outperformance of what had traditionally been these noncore areas, like Hector, and seeing them compete head to head with the Tier 1 inventory that we have across all of our basins."

Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this",1660,"Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities: Compelling improvement and corporate returns and cash flow for debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement and additional return of capital to shareholders. 
Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow for debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and BOE production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through the superior execution and capital efficiency. We are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019 and in the future.
Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This, coupled with our peer-leading balance sheet, further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all-of-the-above strategy that balances enhanced return on cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.
All uses of capital are tested against our returns first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year, leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer-competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns, and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation. We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through 3 complementary efforts, organic extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, small bolt-on acquisition and trade such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale and our resource play exploration program.
We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large-scale M&A.
Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource play means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and our focus on execution that scale. Large-scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success. 
So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and, not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard where our competent efficient extinction an advantage pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry. 
Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer well to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our outperformance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Clarence County in the extended Atascosa County core.
In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% [indiscernible]. This pad included 3 new industry-record Three Forks wells, highlighted by the Jerome well, which established a new Williston Basin IP30 record of around 4800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.
Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot following 20% below the trailing 12-month average. Truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency. 
We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quantity of our Bakken inventory, delivering a strong 2-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.
It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on real, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of uptake out of the Bakken the several and markets that we purposely maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe based on pricing will improve near term and over time, stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.
Further, at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied markets for our products with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing. 
In Oklahoma, third quarter marked a successful transition into multiwell infill pad development. In the over pressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at 4 wells per section spacing and the HR partner infill at 7 wells per sections spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells. Amplifying this quarter's performance longer-term production from our 4Q '17 TAM over pressured STACK pad at 9 wells per section spacing is a 40% above type curve at 270 days. In this group, we delivered 2 more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q '18 Lechner infill at 8 wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.
Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core up our footprints, HPP and the mediator acreage, capture efficiencies and improve our cost structure and secure midstream submissions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts, highlighted by a 50% increase in completion status per day versus the trailing 12-month average and a 20% increase to our gross company operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.
We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent 3-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 BOE per 1000-foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our 4 resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.
In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to delivering a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, highlighted by an 85% annual improvement and cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.
As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow for debt-adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital discipline is our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow and a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource base enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.
The proof points of our commitment to the strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow have delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to the officiate us from our peers as industry discipline has framed mid-higher prices, and we fully expect this the appreciation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantage multi-basin model.
Thank you. And by that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A."

Obviously, we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year in our multi-basin optimization. But just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework. It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated as of this year and if that approach will continue to do that in 2019, I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across 3 consecutive quarter is notable. But specifically, we're going to look to drive a strong rate of change in our corporate returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, and we're going to look to set our 2019 activity levels to deliver organic free cash flow on a conservative oil price deck. Our objective is sustainable organic free cash flow that can support an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's going to include incremental return of cash to our shareholders as well as opportunistic resource capture for us.

We're going to continue as we've kind of highlighted in the Oklahoma slides, continued development in the over pressured STACK and SCOOP. You see a number of upcoming pads there. So we would intend to stay with that philosophy, to continue to leverage their learnings and the application while we're driving well cost lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those 2 specific pads. We're actually seeing improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that, and we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins.

But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and they're going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically, it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those 2 assets for things like leasehold, delineation appraisal and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward. The one other thing that I'll mention too which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019."

It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time. In this case along with vessel inspections and typical kind of maintenance work to do to ensure world-class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade-plus. In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shutdowns to perform, so preinstall some tie-ins. As we've talked about, we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on -- We continue to progress those and we're going to take advantage of this turnaround to make this preemptive tie-ins. You shouldn't view the capital or cash expense related to this turnaround as meaningful in the context of the corporation or even our international operations.

It really it starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We talked about small and very selective bolt-on in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware were up over 20% on a gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017, and that's through trades, some acquisitions and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on very low entry cost. It's certainly still expiration and we need to always come back to that.

Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK, and I think we were one of the first to come out and say come on the far eastern edges, it will be less than 6 wells per section and it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure, we would expect to see instances of greater than 6 wells per section. I think our results over that time period would prove that out. And it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around the similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're implying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less. The outcomes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone at completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2000 horizontal unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from 1 basin to another, and we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity. I mentioned earlier we're doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to targets specific zones within the Meramec across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing, specifically tailored to the subregion and in many cases, down to the DSU."

I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we wanted to play or we can use it, as you stated, as more of a free cash flow capital-efficient engine. Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors, including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital expense, say on the facility side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital. But as you rightly stated, the levels of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond, almost under any scenario we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or slight growth profile. But the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is, very capital efficient.

The simple answer is all of the above but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completely within third quarter but they swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source for those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well cost as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships. The efficiency side, where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or a number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies regarding hand-in-hand with that and we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So it's really an all-of-the-above strategy and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side. And so efforts across many of those spaces and we still see opportunities to drive further improvement in our cost structure."

So all of those things are coming into play to continue to allow us to drive costs down on a completed well cost basis. The other thing I would just mention since we're talking about a little bit of moderation in our wells to sales in the fourth quarter is that in aggregate, we are still delivering wells to sales above the midpoint of our guidance for full year and all basins are also within their guidance.

So we have firmly established expanded the core -- the expanded core across Atascosa County at this point in our view."

Well, certainly, as we look at the Bakken today, with this Court extension that we have enjoyed that in Hector as we hopefully push that even further profession even into the Ajax area, there is little doubt that from a high-value oil growth standpoint, the Bakken is going to have a very material role to play for us going forward. I think as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and infrastructure that show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year or could see Ashley get back into growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So a lot of flexibility but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity where it seems conceited the ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination. And under any scenario, the minimum expectation is an uplift in economics and value, and I think at the end of the day, the net result will be an extension of the inventory in time."

But I was hoping that much more so on your longer-term benchmarks which you haven't updated since Q4 earnings in February this year. But clearly, your U.S. capital efficiency has improved significantly since that time considering you've had the 3 consecutive production guidance raises. So I was curious, what should we expect an update on those longer-term benchmarks? Would that come with formal '19 guidance? And then if possible, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify the outperformance you've seen this year in the U.S. and what the implications are to your longer-term benchmarks. I suppose what I'm asking more or less as if you could rewind to the beginning of the year and know what you know now in the U.S., what would your longer-term benchmarks look like or how much better would it be?"

And it was really again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid and longer-term plans. That maybe something we'll look at in 2019. But we'll really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing event as part of that case were an outcome of the process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point. And so for us again, we're going to be very focus on what you'll see in '19 is very much a focus on where our high-value, high-margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only '19 but even beyond '19, that still work that's ongoing today. As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is we get new data and the performance information each and every day, and that is being integrated and built into our modeling really in realtime. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic. it's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for '19. But as we move through the year and see performance as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So it's a point in time, that's the way it will be. We'll always be focus on delivering our commitments, but our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year."

And it offers very competitive returns given our current market valuation. The pace of that buyback is going to be governed or informed by our sustainable free cash -- organic sustainable free cash flow generation, if we do not want that program reliant on disposition proceeds, that is not the intent. This year, we were able to leverage disposition proceeds to drive a very opportunistic and successful REx program. And in fact, we more than fully funded our resource play exploration activities really proceeds that we received in second quarter of this year. Those disposition proceeds or still available for us to use as opportunities might percent themselves and that would be our view going forward. But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibly the of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunities, small bolt bonds -- I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again, it's not an either or proposition. That's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019. I would maybe just add 1 final thing to you, John, is that, you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor. It's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match."

Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this",1655,"Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities: Compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow for debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement and additional return of capital to shareholders. 
Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow for debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and BOE production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through the superior execution and capital efficiency we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019 and in the future.
Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This, coupled with our peer-leading balance sheet, further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all-of-the-above strategy that balances enhanced return on cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.
All uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year, leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer-competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns, and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation. We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through 3 complementary efforts, organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale and our resource play exploration program.
We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large-scale M&A.
Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution that scale. Large-scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success. 
So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and, not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high-end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard where our competent efficient extinction an advantage pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry. 
Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer wells to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our out-performance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Cairns County in the extended Atascosa County core.
In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% oil cut. This pad included 3 new industry-record Three Forks wells, highlighted by the Jerome well, which established a new Williston Basin IP30 record of around 4800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.
Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot falling 20% below the trailing 12-month average. Truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency. 
We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quantity of our Bakken inventory, delivering a strong 2-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.
It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on rail, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of off-take out of the Bakken to several end-markets and we purposefully maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe basin pricing will improve near-term and over time, stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.
Further, at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied end-markets for our product with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing. 
In Oklahoma, third quarter marked a successful transition into multiwell infill pad development. In the over pressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at 4 wells per section spacing and the HR Potter infill at 7 wells per section spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells. Amplifying this quarter's performance, longer-term production from our 4Q '17 TAN over-pressured STACK pad at 9 wells per section spacing is 40% above type curve at 270 days. In the scoop, we delivered 2 more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q '18 Lightner infill at 8 wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.
Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core-up our footprint, HPP and the delineator acreage, capture efficiencies, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts, highlighted by a 50% increase in completion stages per day versus the trailing 12-month average and a 20% increase to our gross company operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.
We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent 3-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 BOE per 1000-foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our 4 resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.
In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, highlighted by an 85% annual improvement and cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.
As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow for debt-adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital disciplined and set our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow at a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource base enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.
The proof points of our commitment to this strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow we have delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to the differentiate us from our peers as industry discipline has frayed amidst higher prices, and we fully expect this differentiation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantaged multi-basin model.
Thank you. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A."

Right, so absolutely, Ryan, again as I said in my opening remarks, you should expect no surprises from us in 2019 as we get prepared to release our capital budget in February of next year. Obviously, we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year in our multi-basin optimization. But just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework. It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated us this year and that, that approach will continue to do that in 2019, I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across 3 consecutive quarters is notable. But specifically, we're going to look to drive a strong rate-of-change in our corporate returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, and we're going to look to set our 2019 activity levels to deliver organic free cash flow on a conservative oil price deck. Our objective is sustainable organic free cash flow that can support an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's going to include incremental return of cash to our shareholders as well as opportunistic resource capture for us. It's not an either or proposition. Production growth, as I already stated in my comments, is going to be an output of our process and we are going to be very much focused on high-value oil growth because that's where our margins are being generated."

So we would intend to stay with that philosophy, to continue to leverage the learnings and the application while we're driving well cost lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those 2 specific pads. We're actually seeing improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that, and we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins.

That's clearly going to be a part of our February capital budget release. And as I stated, we've got an immense amount of very positive data to incorporate in our planning cycle this go around. What I can tell you is, with the results that our asset teams are achieving today, all of the basins are competing well for capital allocation. We're going to remain very focused on corporate returns, and we want every dollar of our development capital budget to move that key financial metric in the right direction. At a very high level, you should expect the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to continue to receive the majority of our total resource play capital. That's where we're seeing the best returns and the best capital efficiency. And just for your reference, this year, those 2 basins were about 60% of our capital allocation in 2018. But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and they're going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically, it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those 2 assets for things like leasehold, delineation appraisal and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward. The one other thing that I'll mention too which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019."

And as part of our normal long-term maintenance program, we have a major turnaround like this every 3 years or so. And if you look back to the Q1 of '16, you'll see sort of a similar type of event. It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time in this case, along with vessel inspections and the typical kind of maintenance work to do to ensure world-class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade-plus. In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shut-downs to perform some pre-install -- some tie-ins. As we've talked about, we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on Punta Europa. We continue to progress those and we're going to take advantage of this turnaround to make those preemptive tie-ins.

It really it starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We talked about small and very selective bolt-on in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware, we're up over 20% on a gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017, and that's through trades, some acquisitions and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on a very low entry cost. It's certainly still expiration and we need to always come back to that.

Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK, and I think we were one of the first to come out and say on the far eastern edges, it would be less than 6 wells per section and it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure, we would expect to see instances of greater than 6 wells per section. I think our results over that time period would prove that out. And it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around a similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're applying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less. The art comes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone and completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2000 horizontal unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from one basin to another, and we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity. I mentioned earlier we're doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to target specific zones within the Meramec across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing, specifically tailored to the subregion and in many cases, down to the DSU."

Can you talk about how the year-to-date results have changed your view of the asset from a portfolio perspective? I think specifically, did the delineation and improved well results really support adding a little bit more activity? Or given where you are with the other resource plays, should we think about the results as supporting a stronger case for the more-than-less approach that you mentioned? And this is just because you made a -- clearly a lot of progress on timing the Delaware and now especially Oklahoma. But your commentary, you also reiterated that Eagle Ford has some of the highest returns and it also provides pretty valuable cash that supports other parts of the business that don't necessarily generate immediate EBITDA."

I think you for us, Jeanine, the Eagle Ford is a very unique asset in the sense that it's relatively mature but we have now uplifted the value of a large portion of the acreage there that probably not so long ago we would have deemed as lower tier and likely not competing as strongly for capital allocation. I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we want it to play or we can use it, as you stated, as more of a free cash flow capital-efficient engine. Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors, including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital spend, say on the facility side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital. But as you rightly state, with the levels of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond, almost under any scenario we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or slight growth profile. But the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is, very capital efficient. It's a fantastic asset team that continue to push the envelope on innovation, and I think there's still a lot of excitement ahead in the Eagle Ford."

The simple answer is all of the above but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completed in third quarter to swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source for those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well cost as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships. The efficiency side, where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies are coming hand-in-hand with that and we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So it's really an all-of-the-above strategy and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side. And so efforts across many of those spaces and we still see opportunities to drive further improvement in our cost structure."

We're seeing opportunities in the market to term up some element of our fleet, to lock in some strong commercial terms. So all of those things are coming into play to continue to allow us to drive costs down on a completed well cost basis. The other thing I would just mention since we're talking about a little bit of moderation in our wells to sales in the fourth quarter is that in aggregate, we are still delivering wells to sales above the midpoint of our guidance for full year and all basins are also within their guidance.

And I'll come back and answer your questions specifically. But the way I would characterize it is, there some ongoing industry experimentation on choke management strategy and really looking to understand the trade-offs, if any, between kind of returns based on past flowback strategy and ultimate recovery and how that ultimately impacts overall capital efficiency. We obviously are monitoring that activity. We're participating in a lot of that activity. But generally, I would say we are operating with a moderate to slightly aggressive strategy and we do that by integrating real-time bottom hole pressure data into our choke bumps and use those in combination to kind of drive how we open up chokes on these wells. It's a bit early to reach the ultimate and final conclusion on this. There's a handful of pads with kind of 2-years-plus history. But the evaluation that we've done would not show any noticeable impact at EUR based on the different flow back strategies. So we think we pretty well landed on how we're going to continue to operate these wells as we keep our focus on returns and don't at this point see any noticeable impact on EUR."

We have already a peer competitive dividend that exists today, $170 million a year of annual dividend. That's certainly an area that could also be tested to see if there was an action that needed to be taken or something, it's something that is assessed and evaluated each and every quarter in our discussion.

Well, certainly, as we look at the Bakken today, with this core extension that we have enjoyed that in Hector as we hopefully push that even further, potentially even into the Ajax area, there is little doubt that from a high-value oil growth standpoint, the Bakken is going to have a very material role to play for us going forward. I think as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and the infrastructure that we have in the field that could either show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year or could see it actually get back into growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So a lot of flexibility but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity with the team's continued ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination.

Yes, first of all, I want to maybe just make sure everyone understands that the long-term guidance that I believe you're referring to, John, is the '17 to '21 guidance that was really geared toward demonstrating the potential of the portfolio at that point in time on a kind of fixed or flat price assumption. And it was really again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid- and longer-term plans. That may be something we'll look at in 2019. But we really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing even as part of that case were an outcome of a process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point. And so for us again, we're going to be very focused and what you'll see in '19 is very much a focus on where our high-value, high-margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of, can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only '19 but even beyond '19, that's still work that's ongoing today. As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is we get new data and new performance information each and every day, and that is being integrated and built into our modeling really in real time. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic, it's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for '19. But as we move through the year and see performance, as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility in the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So it's a point in time being viewed, that's the way it will be. We'll always be focused on delivering our commitments, but our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year."

But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibly of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunities, small bolt-ons -- I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again, it's not an either or proposition. That's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019. I would maybe just add one final thing too, John, is that, you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor. It's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match."

Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this",1653,"Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities: Compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement and additional return of capital to shareholders. 
Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow for debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and BOE production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through the superior execution and capital efficiency we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019 and in the future.
Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This, coupled with our peer-leading balance sheet, further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all-of-the-above strategy that balances enhanced return of cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.
All uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year, leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer-competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns, and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation. We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through 3 complementary efforts: organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken; small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale and our resource play exploration program.
We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large-scale M&A.
Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution at scale. Large-scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success. 
So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and, not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high-end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard where our competent efficient extinction and advantage pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry. 
Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer wells to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our out-performance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Karnes  County in the extended Atascosa County core.
In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4,700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% oil cut. This pad included 3 new industry-record Three Forks wells, highlighted by the Jerome well, which established a new Williston Basin IP30 record of around 4,800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.
Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot falling 20% below the trailing 12-month average. Truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency. 
We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quantity of our Bakken inventory, delivering a strong 2-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.
It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on rail, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of off-take out of the Bakken to several end-markets and we purposefully maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe basin pricing will improve near-term and over time, stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.
Further, at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied end-markets for our product with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing. 
In Oklahoma, third quarter marked a successful transition into multiwell infill pad development. In the over-pressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at 4 wells per section spacing and the HR Potter infill at 7 wells per section spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells. Amplifying this quarter's performance, longer-term production from our 4Q '17 TAN over-pressured STACK pad at 9 wells per section spacing is 40% above type curve at 270 days. In the SCOOP, we delivered 2 more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q '18 Lightner infill at 8 wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.
Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core-up our footprint, HBP and delineator acreage, capture efficiencies, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts, highlighted by a 50% increase in completion stages per day versus the trailing 12-month average and a 20% increase to our gross company operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.
We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent 3-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 BOE per 1000-foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our 4 resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.
In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, highlighted by an 85% annual improvement and cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.
As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow per debt-adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital disciplined and set our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow at a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource base enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.
The proof points of our commitment to this strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow we have delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to the differentiate us from our peers as industry discipline has frayed amidst higher prices, and we fully expect this differentiation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantaged multi-basin model.
Thank you. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A."

Obviously, we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year in our multi-basin optimization. But just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework. It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated us this year and that, that approach will continue to do that in 2019, I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across 3 consecutive quarters is notable. But specifically, we're going to look to drive a strong rate-of-change in our corporate returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, and we're going to look to set our 2019 activity levels to deliver organic free cash flow on a conservative oil price deck. Our objective is sustainable organic free cash flow that can support an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's going to include incremental return of cash to our shareholders as well as opportunistic resource capture for us.

We're going to continue as we've kind of highlighted in the Oklahoma slides, continued development in the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP. You see a number of upcoming pads there. So we would intend to stay with that philosophy, to continue to leverage the learnings and the application while we're driving well cost lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those 2 specific pads. We're actually seeing improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that, and we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins. So you should see continued activity with our focus on development in both the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP as the majority of our program going into '19."

That's clearly going to be a part of our February capital budget release. And as I stated, we've got an immense amount of very positive data to incorporate in our planning cycle this go around. What I can tell you is, with the results that our asset teams are achieving today, all of the basins are competing well for capital allocation. We're going to remain very focused on corporate returns, and we want every dollar of our development capital budget to move that key financial metric in the right direction. At a very high level, you should expect the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to continue to receive the majority of our total resource play capital. That's where we're seeing the best returns and the best capital efficiency. And just for your reference, this year, those 2 basins were about 60% of our capital allocation in 2018. But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and they're going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically, it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those 2 assets for things like leasehold, delineation appraisal and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward. The one other thing that I'll mention, too, which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019."

And as part of our normal long-term maintenance program, we have a major turnaround like this every 3 years or so. And if you look back to the Q1 of '16, you'll see sort of a similar type of event. It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time in this case, along with vessel inspections and the typical kind of maintenance work we do to ensure world-class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade-plus. In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shut-downs to perform some pre-install -- some tie-ins. As we've talked about, we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on Punta Europa. We continue to progress those and we're going to take advantage of this turnaround to make those preemptive tie-ins. You shouldn't view the capital or cash expense related to this turnaround as meaningful in the context of the corporation or even our international operations.

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, even with that, we are continuing to progress a multipronged approach to continue to even enhance that very strong base, and we talked about a few of those. It really starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We talked about small and very selective bolt-ons in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware, we're up over 20% on gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017, and that's through trades, some acquisitions and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on a very low entry cost. It's certainly still exploration and we need to always come back to that. But with all of those efforts ongoing in parallel, we feel very comfortable that we have a comprehensive strategy in place to replenish and improve our resource base and that does not include large-scale M&A."

Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK, and I think we were one of the first to come out and say on the far eastern edges, it would be less than 6 wells per section and it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure, we would expect to see instances of greater than 6 wells per section. I think our results over that time period would prove that out. And it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around a similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're applying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less. The art comes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone and completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2000 horizontal unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from one basin to another, and we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity. I mentioned earlier we're doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to target specific zones within the Meramec across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing, specifically tailored to the subregion and in many cases, down to the DSU."

I think you for us, Jeanine, the Eagle Ford is a very unique asset in the sense that it's relatively mature but we have now uplifted the value of a large portion of the acreage there that probably not so long ago we would have deemed as lower tier and likely not competing as strongly for capital allocation. I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we want it to play or we can use it, as you stated, as more of a free cash flow capital-efficient engine. Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors, including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital spend, say on the facility side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital. But as you rightly state, with the levels of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond. Almost under any scenario we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or slight growth profile. But the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is, very capital efficient. It's a fantastic asset team that continue to push the envelope on innovation, and I think there's still a lot of excitement ahead in the Eagle Ford."

The simple answer is all of the above but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completed in third quarter to swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source for those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well cost as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships. The efficiency side, where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies are coming hand-in-hand with that and we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So it's really an all-of-the-above strategy and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side. And so efforts across many of those spaces and we still see opportunities to drive further improvement in our cost structure."

So all of those things are coming into play to continue to allow us to drive costs down on a completed well cost basis.

But generally, I would say we are operating with a moderate to slightly aggressive strategy and we do that by integrating real-time bottom hole pressure data into our choke bumps and use those in combination to kind of drive how we open up chokes on these wells. It's a bit early to reach the ultimate and final conclusion on this. There's a handful of pads with kind of 2-years-plus history. But the evaluation that we've done would not show any noticeable impact to EUR based on the different flow back strategies.

Certainly, from a debt standpoint, we did a fantastic job in 2017 reducing gross debt. We don't have a maturity until 2020. So really, from a debt standpoint and a debt metric standpoint, we don't really set a lot of action required there. But I think that's broadly how we would think through it, Brian."

Well, when we think about it from a risk inventory standpoint, Atascosa County obviously was already contributing risk inventory, just at a lower economic value. The effect of the work that the Eagle Ford asset team has been to uplift that area and drive those returns even higher. And so, we would expect that this is more centered around value and returns. It would have obviously the net effect of extending that inventory performance over time at the same kind of run-rate. So that's absolutely a positive there. And also bear in mind, this is, on a go-forward basis, our most underdeveloped area in the Eagle Ford."

I know you're [ say ] circa 30,000 below the Bakken's all-time Marathon high -- I'm sorry, the Eagle Ford. The Bakken is at an all-time Marathon peak.

Well, certainly, as we look at the Bakken today, with this core extension that we have enjoyed in Hector as we hopefully push that even further, potentially even into the Ajax area, there is little doubt that from a high-value oil growth standpoint, the Bakken is going to have a very material role to play for us going forward. I think as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and the infrastructure that we have in the field that could either show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year or could see it actually get back into growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So a lot of flexibility but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity with the team's continued ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination. And under any scenario, the minimum expectation is an uplift in economics and value, and I think at the end of the day, the net result will be an extension of the inventory in time."

And I think we're going to be very slow to add to that, if at all. We're going to be very cautious.

But I was hoping to touch more so on your longer-term benchmarks which you haven't updated since Q4 earnings in February this year. But clearly, your U.S. capital efficiency has improved significantly since that time considering you've had the 3 consecutive production guidance raises. So I was curious, when should we expect an update on those longer-term benchmarks? Would that come with formal '19 guidance? And then if possible, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify the out-performance you've seen this year in the U.S. and what the implications are to your longer-term benchmarks. I suppose what I'm asking more or less as if you could rewind to the beginning of the year and know what you know now in the U.S., what would your longer-term benchmarks look like or how much better would they be?"

Yes, first of all, I want to maybe just make sure everyone understands that the long-term guidance that I believe you're referring to, John, is the '17 to '21 guidance that was really geared toward demonstrating the potential of the portfolio at that point in time on a kind of fixed or flat price assumption. And it was really again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid- and longer-term plans. That may be something we'll look at in 2019. But we really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing even as part of that case were an outcome of a process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point. And so for us again, we're going to be very focused and what you'll see in '19 is very much a focus on where our high-value, high-margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of, can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only '19 but even beyond '19, that's still work that's ongoing today. As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is we get new data and new performance information each and every day, and that is being integrated and built into our modeling really in real time. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic, it's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for '19. But as we move through the year and see performance, as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility in the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So it's a point in time view; that's the way it will be. We'll always be focused on delivering our commitments, but our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year."

And it offers very competitive returns given our current market valuation. The pace of that buyback is going to be governed or informed by our sustainable free cash -- organic free cash flow generation. We do not want that program reliant on disposition proceeds, that is not the intent. This year, we were able to leverage disposition proceeds to drive a very opportunistic and successful REx program. And in fact, we more than fully funded our resource play exploration activities with the proceeds that we received in second quarter of this year. Those disposition proceeds are still available for us to use as opportunities might present themselves and that would be our view going forward. But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibly of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunities, small bolt-ons, lease -- I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again, it's not an either or proposition. That's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019. I would maybe just add one final thing too, John, is that, you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor. It's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match."

It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities: Compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement and additional return of capital to shareholders. 
Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and BOE production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through the superior execution and capital efficiency we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019 and in the future.
Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This, coupled with our peer-leading balance sheet, further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all-of-the-above strategy that balances enhanced return of cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.
All uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year, leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer-competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns, and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation. We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through 3 complementary efforts: organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken; small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale and our resource play exploration program.
We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large-scale M&A.
Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution at scale. Large-scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success. 
So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and, not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high-end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard where our capital efficient execution and advantaged pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry. 
Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer wells to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our out-performance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Karnes County in the extended Atascosa County core.
In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4,700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% oil cut. This pad included 3 new industry-record Three Forks wells, highlighted by the Jerome well, which established a new Williston Basin IP30 record of around 4,800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.
Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot falling 20% below the trailing 12-month average. Truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency. 
We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quality of our Bakken inventory, delivering a strong 2-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.
It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on rail, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of off-take out of the Bakken to several end-markets and we purposefully maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe basin pricing will improve near-term and over time, stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.
Further, at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied end-markets for our product with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing. 
In Oklahoma, third quarter marked a successful transition into multiwell infill pad development. In the over-pressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at 4 wells per section spacing and the HR Potter infill at 7 wells per section spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells. Amplifying this quarter's performance, longer-term production from our 4Q '17 TAN over-pressured STACK pad at 9 wells per section spacing is 40% above type curve at 270 days. In the SCOOP, we delivered 2 more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q '18 Lightner infill at 8 wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.
Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core-up our footprint, HBP and delineator acreage, capture efficiencies, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts, highlighted by a 50% increase in completion stages per day versus the trailing 12-month average and a 20% increase to our gross company operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.
We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent 3-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 BOE per 1000-foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our 4 resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.
In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, highlighted by an 85% annual improvement in cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.
As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow per debt-adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital disciplined and set our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow at a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource base enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.
The proof points of our commitment to this strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow we have delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to the differentiate us from our peers as industry discipline has frayed amidst higher prices, and we fully expect this differentiation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantaged multi-basin model.
Thank you. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A."

Right, so absolutely, Ryan, again as I said in my opening remarks, you should expect no surprises from us in 2019 as we get prepared to release our capital budget in February of next year. Obviously, we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year in our multi-basin optimization. But just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework. It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated us this year and that, that approach will continue to do that in 2019, I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across 3 consecutive quarters is notable. But specifically, we're going to look to drive a strong rate-of-change in our corporate returns and cash flow per debt-adjusted share, and we're going to look to set our 2019 activity levels to deliver organic free cash flow on a conservative oil price deck. Our objective is sustainable organic free cash flow that can support an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's going to include incremental return of cash to our shareholders as well as opportunistic resource capture for us. It's not an either or proposition. Production growth, as I already stated in my comments, is going to be an output of our process and we are going to be very much focused on high-value oil growth because that's where our margins are being generated."

And evidenced by the last 3 pads in the over-pressured STACK around different well spacing with some differences in completion design as well but delivering very consistent results. We're going to continue as we've kind of highlighted in the Oklahoma slides, continued development in the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP. You see a number of upcoming pads there. So we would intend to stay with that philosophy, to continue to leverage the learnings and the application while we're driving well cost lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those 2 specific pads. We're actually seeing improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that, and we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins. So you should see continued activity with our focus on development in both the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP as the majority of our program going into '19."

What I can tell you is, with the results that our asset teams are achieving today, all of the basins are competing well for capital allocation. We're going to remain very focused on corporate returns, and we want every dollar of our development capital budget to move that key financial metric in the right direction. At a very high level, you should expect the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to continue to receive the majority of our total resource play capital. That's where we're seeing the best returns and the best capital efficiency. And just for your reference, this year, those 2 basins were about 60% of our capital allocation in 2018. But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and they're going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically, it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those 2 assets for things like leasehold, delineation appraisal and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward. The one other thing that I'll mention, too, which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019."

It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time in this case, along with vessel inspections and the typical kind of maintenance work we do to ensure world-class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade-plus. In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shutdowns to perform some pre-install -- some tie-ins. As we've talked about, we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on Punta Europa.

It really starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We talked about small and very selective bolt-ons in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware, we're up over 20% on gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017, and that's through trades, some acquisitions and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on a very low entry cost.

Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK, and I think we were one of the first to come out and say on the far eastern edges, it would be less than 6 wells per section and it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure, we would expect to see instances of greater than 6 wells per section. I think our results over that time period would prove that out. And it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around a similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're applying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less. The art comes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone and completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2000 horizontal unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from one basin to another, and we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity. I mentioned earlier we're doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to target specific zones within the Meramec across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing, specifically tailored to the subregion and in many cases, down to the DSU."

I think you for us, Jeanine, the Eagle Ford is a very unique asset in the sense that it's relatively mature but we have now uplifted the value of a large portion of the acreage there that probably not so long ago we would have deemed as lower tier and likely not competing as strongly for capital allocation. I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we want it to play or we can use it, as you stated, as more of a free cash flow capital-efficient engine. Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors, including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital spend, say on the facility side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital. But as you rightly state, with the levels of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond. Almost under any scenario we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or slight growth profile. But the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is, very capital efficient. It's a fantastic asset team that continue to push the envelope on innovation, and I think there's still a lot of excitement ahead in the Eagle Ford."

The simple answer is all of the above but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completed in third quarter to swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source for those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well cost as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships. The efficiency side, where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies are coming hand-in-hand with that and we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So it's really an all-of-the-above strategy and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side. And so efforts across many of those spaces and we still see opportunities to drive further improvement in our cost structure."

So all of those things are coming into play to continue to allow us to drive costs down on a completed well cost basis. The other thing I would just mention since we're talking about a little bit of moderation in our wells to sales in the fourth quarter is that in aggregate, we are still delivering wells to sales above the midpoint of our guidance for full year and all basins are also within their guidance.

We obviously are monitoring that activity. We participate in a lot of that activity. But generally, I would say we are operating with a moderate to slightly aggressive strategy and we do that by integrating real-time bottom hole pressure data into our choke bumps and use those in combination to kind of drive how we open up chokes on these wells. It's a bit early to reach the ultimate and final conclusion on this. There's a handful of pads with kind of 2-years-plus history. But the evaluation that we've done would not show any noticeable impact to EUR based on the different flow back strategies. So we think we pretty well landed on how we're going to continue to operate these wells as we keep our focus on returns and don't at this point see any noticeable impact on EUR."

We have already a peer competitive dividend that exists today, $170 million a year of annual dividend. That's certainly an area that could also be tested to see if there was an action that needed to be taken. It's something that is assessed and evaluated each and every quarter in our discussions with our board, no difference than share repurchase.

I think as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and the infrastructure that we have in the field that could either show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year or could see it actually get back into growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So a lot of flexibility but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity with the team's continued ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination.

Yes, first of all, I want to maybe just make sure everyone understands that the long-term guidance that I believe you're referring to, John, is the '17 to '21 guidance that was really geared toward demonstrating the potential of the portfolio at that point in time on a kind of fixed or flat price assumption. And it was really again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid- and longer-term plans. That may be something we'll look at in 2019. But we really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing even as part of that case were an outcome of a process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point. And so for us again, we're going to be very focused and what you'll see in '19 is very much a focus on where our high-value, high-margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of, can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only '19 but even beyond '19, that's still work that's ongoing today. As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is we get new data and new performance information each and every day, and that is being integrated and built into our modeling really in real time. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic, it's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for '19. But as we move through the year and see performance, as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility in the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So it's a point in time view; that's the way it will be. We'll always be focused on delivering our commitments, but our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year."

And it offers very competitive returns given our current market valuation. The pace of that buyback is going to be governed or informed by our sustainable free cash -- organic free cash flow generation. We do not want that program reliant on disposition proceeds, that is not the intent. This year, we were able to leverage disposition proceeds to drive a very opportunistic and successful REx program. And in fact, we more than fully funded our resource play exploration activities with the proceeds that we received in second quarter of this year. Those disposition proceeds are still available for us to use as opportunities might present themselves and that would be our view going forward. But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibly of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunities, small bolt-ons, lease -- I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again, it's not an either or proposition. That's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019. I would maybe just add one final thing too, John, is that, you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor. It's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match."

Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this",1653,"Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities: Compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement and additional return of capital to shareholders. 
Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and BOE production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through the superior execution and capital efficiency we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019 and in the future.
Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This, coupled with our peer-leading balance sheet, further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all-of-the-above strategy that balances enhanced return of cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.
All uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year, leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer-competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns, and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation. We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through 3 complementary efforts: organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken; small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale and our resource play exploration program.
We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large-scale M&A.
Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the 4 best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution at scale. Large-scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success. 
So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and, not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high-end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard where our capital efficient execution and advantaged pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry. 
Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer wells to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our out-performance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Karnes County in the extended Atascosa County core.
In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4,700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% oil cut. This pad included 3 new industry-record Three Forks wells, highlighted by the Jerome well, which established a new Williston Basin IP30 record of around 4,800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.
Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot falling 20% below the trailing 12-month average. Truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency. 
We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quality of our Bakken inventory, delivering a strong 2-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.
It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on rail, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of off-take out of the Bakken to several end-markets and we purposefully maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe basin pricing will improve near-term and over time, stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.
Further, at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied end-markets for our product with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing. 
In Oklahoma, third quarter marked a successful transition into multiwell infill pad development. In the over-pressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at 4 wells per section spacing and the HR Potter infill at 7 wells per section spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells. Amplifying this quarter's performance, longer-term production from our 4Q '17 TAN over-pressured STACK pad at 9 wells per section spacing is 40% above type curve at 270 days. In the SCOOP, we delivered 2 more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q '18 Lightner infill at 8 wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.
Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core-up our footprint, HBP and delineator acreage, capture efficiencies, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts, highlighted by a 50% increase in completion stages per day versus the trailing 12-month average and a 20% increase to our gross company operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.
We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent 3-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 BOE per 1000-foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our 4 resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.
In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics, highlighted by an 85% annual improvement in cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.
As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow per debt-adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital disciplined and set our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow at a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource base enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.
The proof points of our commitment to this strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow we have delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to the differentiate us from our peers as industry discipline has frayed amidst higher prices, and we fully expect this differentiation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantaged multi-basin model.
Thank you. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A."

Obviously, we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year in our multi-basin optimization. But just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework. It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated us this year and that, that approach will continue to do that in 2019, I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across 3 consecutive quarters is notable.

We've been talking for a couple of quarters now about the transition to development mode in the over-pressured STACK and in the SCOOP. We've been integrating data from our own activity and from industry. We're applying some advanced seismic processing techniques to help guide the combination of well spacing, landing zone and completion design, and it's the intersection and the combination of all those factors that we're starting to hone in on. And evidenced by the last 3 pads in the over-pressured STACK around different well spacing with some differences in completion design as well but delivering very consistent results. We're going to continue as we've kind of highlighted in the Oklahoma slides, continued development in the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP. You see a number of upcoming pads there. So we would intend to stay with that philosophy, to continue to leverage the learnings and the application while we're driving well cost lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those 2 specific pads. We're actually seeing improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that, and we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins. So you should see continued activity with our focus on development in both the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP as the majority of our program going into '19."

That's clearly going to be a part of our February capital budget release. And as I stated, we've got an immense amount of very positive data to incorporate in our planning cycle this go around. What I can tell you is, with the results that our asset teams are achieving today, all of the basins are competing well for capital allocation. We're going to remain very focused on corporate returns, and we want every dollar of our development capital budget to move that key financial metric in the right direction. At a very high level, you should expect the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to continue to receive the majority of our total resource play capital. That's where we're seeing the best returns and the best capital efficiency. And just for your reference, this year, those 2 basins were about 60% of our capital allocation in 2018. But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and they're going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically, it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those 2 assets for things like leasehold, delineation appraisal and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward. The one other thing that I'll mention, too, which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019."

It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time in this case, along with vessel inspections and the typical kind of maintenance work we do to ensure world-class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade-plus. In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shutdowns to perform some pre-install -- some tie-ins. As we've talked about, we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on Punta Europa. We continue to progress those and we're going to take advantage of this turnaround to make those preemptive tie-ins.

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, even with that, we are continuing to progress a multipronged approach to continue to even enhance that very strong base, and we talked about a few of those. It really starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We talked about small and very selective bolt-ons in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware, we're up over 20% on gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017, and that's through trades, some acquisitions and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on a very low entry cost. It's certainly still exploration and we need to always come back to that.

Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK, and I think we were one of the first to come out and say on the far eastern edges, it would be less than 6 wells per section and it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure, we would expect to see instances of greater than 6 wells per section. I think our results over that time period would prove that out. And it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around a similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're applying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less. The art comes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone and completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2000 horizontal unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from one basin to another, and we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity. I mentioned earlier we're doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to target specific zones within the Meramec across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing, specifically tailored to the subregion and in many cases, down to the DSU."

I think you for us, Jeanine, the Eagle Ford is a very unique asset in the sense that it's relatively mature but we have now uplifted the value of a large portion of the acreage there that probably not so long ago we would have deemed as lower tier and likely not competing as strongly for capital allocation. I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we want it to play or we can use it, as you stated, as more of a free cash flow capital-efficient engine. Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors, including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital spend, say on the facility side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital. But as you rightly state, with the levels of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond. Almost under any scenario we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or slight growth profile. But the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is, very capital efficient. It's a fantastic asset team that continue to push the envelope on innovation, and I think there's still a lot of excitement ahead in the Eagle Ford."

The simple answer is all of the above but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completed in third quarter to swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source for those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well cost as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships. The efficiency side, where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies are coming hand-in-hand with that and we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So it's really an all-of-the-above strategy and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side.

So we think we pretty well landed on how we're going to continue to operate these wells as we keep our focus on returns and don't at this point see any noticeable impact on EUR."

Clearly, we have many developmental opportunities that we can pursue if that was the right decision. We obviously have our work in resource capture. We talked about kind of this multipronged approach everything from small bolt-ons on to the activity in REx. And also bear in mind that REx will ultimately, we hope, have some wells go into predevelopment mode, and so there could be some funding requirements there. We have already a peer competitive dividend that exists today, $170 million a year of annual dividend. That's certainly an area that could also be tested to see if there was an action that needed to be taken. It's something that is assessed and evaluated each and every quarter in our discussions with our board, no difference than share repurchase. Certainly, from a debt standpoint, we did a fantastic job in 2017 reducing gross debt. We don't have a maturity until 2020.

Well, certainly, as we look at the Bakken today, with this core extension that we have enjoyed in Hector as we hopefully push that even further, potentially even into the Ajax area, there is little doubt that from a high-value oil growth standpoint, the Bakken is going to have a very material role to play for us going forward. I think as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and the infrastructure that we have in the field that could either show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year or could see it actually get back into growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So a lot of flexibility but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity with the team's continued ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination. And under any scenario, the minimum expectation is an uplift in economics and value, and I think at the end of the day, the net result will be an extension of the inventory in time."

But I was hoping to touch more so on your longer-term benchmarks which you haven't updated since Q4 earnings in February this year. But clearly, your U.S. capital efficiency has improved significantly since that time considering you've had the 3 consecutive production guidance raises. So I was curious, when should we expect an update on those longer-term benchmarks? Would that come with formal '19 guidance? And then if possible, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify the out-performance you've seen this year in the U.S. and what the implications are to your longer-term benchmarks. I suppose what I'm asking more or less as if you could rewind to the beginning of the year and know what you know now in the U.S., what would your longer-term benchmarks look like or how much better would they be?"

Yes, first of all, I want to maybe just make sure everyone understands that the long-term guidance that I believe you're referring to, John, is the '17 to '21 guidance that was really geared toward demonstrating the potential of the portfolio at that point in time on a kind of fixed or flat price assumption. And it was really again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid- and longer-term plans. That may be something we'll look at in 2019. But we really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing even as part of that case were an outcome of a process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point. And so for us again, we're going to be very focused and what you'll see in '19 is very much a focus on where our high-value, high-margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of, can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only '19 but even beyond '19, that's still work that's ongoing today. As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is we get new data and new performance information each and every day, and that is being integrated and built into our modeling really in real time. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic, it's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for '19. But as we move through the year and see performance, as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility in the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So it's a point in time view; that's the way it will be. We'll always be focused on delivering our commitments, but our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year."

And it offers very competitive returns given our current market valuation. The pace of that buyback is going to be governed or informed by our sustainable free cash -- organic free cash flow generation. We do not want that program reliant on disposition proceeds, that is not the intent. This year, we were able to leverage disposition proceeds to drive a very opportunistic and successful REx program. And in fact, we more than fully funded our resource play exploration activities with the proceeds that we received in second quarter of this year. Those disposition proceeds are still available for us to use as opportunities might present themselves and that would be our view going forward. But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibly of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunities, small bolt-ons, lease -- I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again, it's not an either or proposition. That's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019. I would maybe just add one final thing too, John, is that, you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor. It's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match."
