The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter.
The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the currently estimate, which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter, and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter.
As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, together with the reduction in Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans as well as logistical costs from imports.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicate of storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million warehouse and distribution center in Southern California.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, [indiscernible] increase costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions and trade development.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor terminations, were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter.
In the quarter, our overall expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago, and stock-based compensation and noncash items was $0.9 million higher.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to Q2 $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to the establishment cost in advance of the lines, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reasons as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a onetime deemed mandatory repatriation of post- 1996 earnings and profits as a result of the tax reform act signed into law in December 22, 2017.
Under the tax reform act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017.
Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. We continued to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce.
In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in part of certain Arkansas, and with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transition to Coca-Cola Bottlers.
In the EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in our , Belarus and Tanzania.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in the Bahamas and Granada as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler.
We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018.
In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan.
We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a  limited territory and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier.
We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S. where Mutant is positioned as a super shareholder, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam in 2018.
Raw material cost savings from the AFF concession were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Sales of Red Bull were flat. Rockstar was down 2.4%. 5-Hours were down 8.4% and Amp was down 15.5%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.2 points over the same period last year to 38.1%.

Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8% lower.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely work through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter.
Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the Energy Drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year.
Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4% and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6%, and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9% while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers several months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken by that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 24.7% to 28.6% in Spain, and in France, from 22.5% to 25.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium, from 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden, from 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy.
For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.1% in South Africa. Although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period. And from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic. Although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2017, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017 as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended December 24th, 2017 grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. 
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.
According to, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain markets statistic that covers single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy's your segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6% from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements. 
Net sales for the strategic brands segment was $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. 
Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in US dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reduction has resulted in substantially higher sales to net distribution partner in January 2018 as computed compared to January 2017. 
It is significant to note that sales distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in the EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range is now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We also took Monster to continue perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2% or 10% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production, which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter.
As with a number of other overseas distributors, sales by distributor by the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remain strong and in line with earlier periods.
In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to Q2 the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 25.2% or 23.2% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market initially limited territory.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru. In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016.
Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. 
Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster as well as in advance of the launches, Coffee Monster and Muscle Monster bottles compared to 2017 in December 31, 2016. Monster Energy continued to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresson Monster in 2 flavors and NOS in the U.S. at the end of 2017.
In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee and 13.7-ounce glass bottles in 3 flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors.
In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our 2 Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster Max line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing one of our 2 existing SKUs in this line and adding 2 new flavors. We are also launching White Dragon tea. Finally, capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we're expanding Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding 3 new flavors.
In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. 
In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle orange in 16-ounce can.
We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018.
We are launching Monster Energy Ultra Violet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The newest Hamilton signature Monster energy drink launched in the second quarter of 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature monster energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. 
We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017.
In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to a, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, which will launched in January 2018.
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they also unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as the single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for our full quarter or any future periods.
On February 20, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million, excluding broker commissions, leading the remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience markets statistics for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018 reflect the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.9% market share, including the strategic brands and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sale statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we're excited about the prospects of our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in the international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and/or India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year and anticipate further transitions and launches this year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

The use a different testing, set of test for what we do and we use around the world. And we've been having a number of debates about what the levels were off because we were comfortable with the ingredient level that we put it, important but yet they are coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results a little differently. But yet, that is the method that is used in India. And that has caused some hiccups and delays in getting going because we just can't -- we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock writeoffs. With regard to Canada and the U.S., I think there's an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are all coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, and it has improved from the latter part of last year."

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter. The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the currently estimate, which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter. As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, together with the reduction in Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans as well as logistical costs from imports.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million square foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions and trade development.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor terminations, were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago, and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $0.9 million higher.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to the establishment cost in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reasons as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a onetime deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1996 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law in December 22, 2017.
Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.
Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas, and with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in the Bahamas and Granada as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler.
We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018.
In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan.
We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier.
We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S. where Mutant is positioned as a super soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam in 2018.
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.8% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8% lower.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 45% and its market share increased 0.4 point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35.8%. Rockstar sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.7 point to 18%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4% and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 24.7% to 28.6% in Spain and in France from 22.5% to 25.5%.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium, from 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden, from 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy.
For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period; and from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic, although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017 as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended December 24, 2017, grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6% from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reduction has resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017.
It is significant to note that sales by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India.
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2% or 10% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production, which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with the number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remain strong and in line with earlier periods.
In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 25.2% or 23.2% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market initially in a limited territory.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru.
In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster as well as in advance of their launches, Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in 2 flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in 3 flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors.
In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our 2 Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster Maxx line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing 1 of our 2 existing SKUs in this line and adding 2 new flavors. We are also launching rehabbed White Dragon tea. Finally, capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we're expanding Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding 3 new flavors.
In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans.
We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultra Violet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink launched in the second quarter of 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter.
We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to, a, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, which will launched in January 2018.
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as the single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future periods.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million, excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.9% market share, including the strategic brands, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we are excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year and anticipate further transitions and launches this year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

They use a different testing -- set of tests to what we do and we use around the world. And we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient level that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results a little differently. But yet that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we just can't -- we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock writeoffs. With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently.

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter. The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the currently estimate, which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter. As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, together with the reduction in Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans as well as logistical costs from imports.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million-square-foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions and trade development.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor terminations, were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago; and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $0.9 million higher.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to the establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reasons as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a onetime deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1996 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law in December 22, 2017.
Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.
Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas, and with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in the Bahamas and Granada as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler.
We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018.
In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan.
We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier.
We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S. where Mutant is positioned as a super soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam in 2018.
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2018, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 5.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 7.3% and sales of Amp decreased 22.4%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 4.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 13.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull were flat. Rockstar was down 2.4%. 5-Hour was down 8.4% and Amp was down 15.5%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.2 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS' share increased by 0.1 points to 4.3% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull share decreased 1.4 points to 34.1%. Rockstar share was down 0.5 points to 7.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.6%. And Amp's share decreased 0.3 points to 1.1%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.8% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8% lower.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 45% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35.8%. Rockstar sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.7 points to 18%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4%, and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 27.4% to 28.6% in Spain and in France from 22.5% to 25.5%.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium, from 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden, from 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy.
For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period; and from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic, although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017 as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended December 24, 2017, grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6%, from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs, as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reductions resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017.
It is significant to note that sales by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India.
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2% or 10% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production, which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with the number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remain strong and in line with earlier periods.
In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 25.2% or 23.2% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market initially in a limited territory.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru.
In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster as well as in advance of their launches, Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in 2 flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles, in 3 flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors.
In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our 2 Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster Maxx line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing 1 of our 2 existing SKUs in this line and adding 2 new flavors. We are also launching a rehabbed White Dragon tea. Finally, capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we're expanding Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding 3 new flavors.
In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans.
We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultra Violet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink launched in the second quarter of 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter.
We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to, a, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and, b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, which will launched in January 2018.
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as the single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million, excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars and a 42.9% market share, including the strategic brands, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we are excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year and anticipate further transitions and launches this year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

They use a different testing -- set of tests to what we do and we use around the world. And we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient levels that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results, a little differently. But yet that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we just can't -- we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock writeoffs. With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, but it has improved from the latter part of last year."

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter. The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the currently estimate, which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter. As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, together with the reduction in Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans as well as logistical costs from imports.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million-square-foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions and trade development.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor terminations, were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago; and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $0.9 million higher.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to the establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reasons as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a onetime deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1996 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law in December 22, 2017.
Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.
Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas, and with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in the Bahamas and Granada as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler.
We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018.
In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan.
We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier.
We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S. where Mutant is positioned as a super soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam in 2018.
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2018, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 5.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 7.3% and sales of Amp decreased 22.4%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 4.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 13.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull were flat. Rockstar was down 2.4%. 5-Hour was down 8.4% and Amp was down 15.5%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.2 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS' share increased by 0.1 points to 4.3% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull share decreased 1.4 points to 34.1%. Rockstar share was down 0.5 points to 7.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.6%. And Amp's share decreased 0.3 points to 1.1%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.8% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8% lower.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 45% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35.8%. Rockstar sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.7 points to 18%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4%, and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 27.4% to 28.6% in Spain and in France from 22.5% to 25.5%.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium, from 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden, from 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy.
For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period; and from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic, although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017 as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended December 24, 2017, grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6%, from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs, as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reductions resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017.
It is significant to note that sales by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India.
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2% or 10% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production, which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with the number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remain strong and in line with earlier periods.
In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 25.2% or 23.2% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market initially in a limited territory.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru.
In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster as well as in advance of their launches, Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in 2 flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles, in 3 flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors.
In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our 2 Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster Maxx line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing 1 of our 2 existing SKUs in this line and adding 2 new flavors. We are also launching a rehabbed White Dragon tea. Finally, capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we're expanding Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding 3 new flavors.
In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans.
We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultra Violet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink launched in the second quarter of 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter.
We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to, a, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and, b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, which will launched in January 2018.
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as the single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million, excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars and a 42.9% market share, including the strategic brands, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we are excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year and anticipate further transitions and launches this year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

And we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient levels that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results, a little differently. But yet that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we just can't -- we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock writeoffs. With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, but it has improved from the latter part of last year."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for, under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for the equity method were included in operating expenses.
In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would've been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of foreign currency movements. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6% as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter, and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix of foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a changing domestic product sales mix, principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain input costs, principally freight in aluminum cans and sucralose; hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA; and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter, likely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributer termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. 
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons as well as data inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rates decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax reduction.
Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million in -- for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributor terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. 
In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we have now fully transitioned to the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets.
During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution of sales of Monster in India, more extensively later this year. 
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia, and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year.

Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were 26.1%, higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 6.2% lower.

Java Monster share alone for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 47.6%, up 2.6 points, while Starbucks Double Shot's energy share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came [indiscernible] by the end of the quarter.
Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen, in the community gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS's sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle's sales increased 22% and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 points to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9% and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7% and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in 3 flavors. We launched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our 2 Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with 3 new flavors. In Canada, in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550-ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans. 
In EMEA, we launched Monster Hydro in 550-ml PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018.
In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium.
We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018.

We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April 2017. On a foreign exchange-adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Do note that the impact of the ASC 606 is not being included in determining these figures. April had 1 extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales [indiscernible] period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores. Distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales of regional periods such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be inclusive to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions.
In February 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continue to achieve record market shares in the U.S. in and countries. Retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are oneoff costs and some of which may be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day. The Midwest premium, freight, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India and so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many noncontrollable factors. But we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis."

And the second question, which is related to this, other companies, let's say, Blue Buffalo, their gross margin story would be production in-house from third party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean, as you own distribution to the Coke system, is there opportunity there to also shift production?

All of our products are copacked. We have a finished product model. That's not going to change. What will change is as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing cost, reducing freight, reducing import duties. And so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Whether or some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them, for example, a 24-ounce can in for NOS in the U.S., we then offselling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we are obviously in the one case selling concentrated our higher margin and the other case, we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin because -- just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's all on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants, that is also particularly, so with regard to the newer product like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee products because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster, but we are all looking to convert that to a local production which will, again, which will assist in cost. And as we start ramping up with Caffe Monster, we're looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We are looking to in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming on board, which will reduce costs. Would you take the first question?"

And our bottlers have just come back from China, have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumer's can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. Our product is now placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite. It doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is.

And that continues to be an ongoing challenge. We have seconded some of our key stop from the U.S. to really educate them and to actually be able to redirect them and show them what we need to do. And we're confident we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder and harder road. It will be achieved and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, we talked about the younger, more affluent, really there hasn't been a change. In China, we have our product as culminated. Our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product Thai Red Bull in China. And we believe that we will continue with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world, but and it aligned with Red Bull China, but it is at a premium to some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that's just -- we'll continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is to again, getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to -- or the consumer doesn't have access to price like YouTube that they have around the rest of the world and we are improving, obviously, taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiarized through the local social media companies that have equivalent channels and programs in China."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales; whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.
In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of foreign currency movements. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6%, as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter, and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix. Our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix, principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain input costs, principally freight in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA; and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter, as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5%, compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3%, as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter, as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter, as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons, as well as due to inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million in -- for the first quarter of 2018, as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributor terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after tax. 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we've now fully transitioned to the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets.
During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution of sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year. 
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Monster increased by 14.7% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle was up 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.6%, Rockstar was down 5.6%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 21.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3 points over the same period last year to 37.8%. NOS' share remained the same at 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1 point to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.8 of a point to 7.1%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 point to -- at 6.7%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.3 of a point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 19.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were 26.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 6.2% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which we define as including Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 56.6%, up 11.7 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 47.6%, up 2.6 points; while Starbucks Double Shot's energy share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off that occasion by the end of that quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle sales increased 22%, and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 point to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 point to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9%, and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7%, and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium; from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic; from 23.7% to 27.1% in France; from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain; from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece; from 10% to 14.1% in Italy; from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands; from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway; from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland; from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain; and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden.

For the 13-week period ended March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 16% in Germany; and from 16.8% to 15.3% in South Africa, although sales were up in both countries. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2018, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 28.4% to 34.4% compared to the same period last year; and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of March 2018 increased from 7.4% to 14.9%, as compared to the same period last year.

According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended March 18, 2018, grew from 5.7% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. 
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 25.1% to 30.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 45.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover a single month may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.7% from $668.6 million to $780.5 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 17.3%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.4 million of foreign currency movements. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $65.8 million for the first quarter, as compared to $68 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.6%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $2.3 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the first quarter, as compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter last year.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $17.7 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 30.5% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 37.2% in net sales and 23.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales for the quarter, was 44.5% compared to 50.3% in the same quarter last year and 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. 
We are pleased with the roll-out of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 21.3% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% versus 47.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 54.6% or 49.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In South Korea, net sales increased 22.9% or 13.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 5.5% or 1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the first quarter increased 37.7% in dollars and 34.5% in local currencies over the same period last year.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 48.8% over the same period last year and 47.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2%. Net sales increased in Brazil by 86.1% in dollars and 88.2% in local currency, largely due to the continued performance of Monster Energy drinks. Net sales in Chile increased 27.9% in dollars and 20% in local currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $511.4 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $585.2 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $33.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased to $525.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.1 days, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $268.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 71.7 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in 3 flavors, relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors, and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our 2 Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with 3 new flavors. In Canada, in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans. In EMEA, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we will launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea along with Cuba Libre in Japan. We launched the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. 
We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April 2017. On a foreign exchange-adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 is not being included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales of over a short period, such as a single month or even 2 months, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day, the Midwest premium, freight, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India. And so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many noncontrollable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis."

I mean, a number of companies in the industry are facing, what I call, cyclical gross margin issues with aluminum, lags and increasing prices. But in your case, it seems to me that you face secular issues also, going from single cans to pack sizes in the U.S., growing faster overseas than domestically. I mean, in China, your prices are much lower. So I don't know if it's possible but if you could just help us understand, in terms of these declining gross margins we are seeing, how much would we consider cyclical and how much will be secular. And the second question which is related to this, other companies, let's say, Blue Buffalo, their gross margin story would be that they would bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean, as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there opportunity there to also shift production or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one, on the same topic..."

Guy, we spoke about one question at a time, okay. So let's just -- let me just start with production. All of our products are Coke-packed. We have a finished product model. That's not going to change. What will change is as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing cost or reducing freight, reducing import duties. And so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Whether or some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them, for example, a 24-ounce cap can in -- for NOS in the U.S., we're then off selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously, in one case, selling concentrate with a higher margin; and the other case, we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin because -- just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower cost by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer product like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee products because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster but we are looking to convert that to a local production, which will -- again, which will assist in cost. And as we start ramping up with Caffe Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We are looking to -- in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming onboard, which will reduce costs. Could you take the first question, Hilton?"

So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good, sustainable sales. And our bottlers -- I've just come back from China, have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded, and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is. So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with, called Battlegrounds, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year.

And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder and harder road. And it will be achieved but we -- and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, we talked about the younger and more affluent. There really hasn't been a change. In China, we have -- our product is carbonated. We -- our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product, Thai Red Bull, in China. And we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world but -- and it is aligned with Red Bull China but that is at a premium to other -- some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that's just -- we'll continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just to gain -- getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to -- or the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and obviously taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiarized through the local social media companies that have equivalent channels and programs in China."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales; whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.
In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of forex currency movements. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6%, as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to: increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix. Our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix, principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain input costs, principally freight in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA; and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter, as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5%, compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3%, as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter, as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter, as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons, as well as due to inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million in -- for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributor terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after tax. 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we've now fully transitioned to the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets.
During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution of sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year. 
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 13.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 6.1% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 2.6%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.6%, and sales of Amp decreased 19.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 14.7% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle was up 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.6%, Rockstar was down 5.6%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 21.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3 points over the same period last year to 37.8%. NOS' share remained the same at 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1 point to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.8 of a point to 7.1%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 point to -- at 6.7%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.3 of a point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 19.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were 26.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 6.2% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which we define as including Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 56.6%, up 11.7 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 47.6%, up 2.6 points; while Starbucks Double Shot's energy share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off that occasion by the end of that quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS' sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle sales increased 22%, and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 point to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 point to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9%, and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7%, and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium; from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic; from 23.7% to 27.1% in France; from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain; from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece; from 10% to 14.1% in Italy; from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands; from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway; from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland; from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain; and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 45.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.7% from $668.6 million to $780.5 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 17.3%.

Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $65.8 million for the first quarter, as compared to $68 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.6%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $2.3 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $17.7 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 30.5% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 37.2% in net sales and 23.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 44.5%, compared to 50.3% in the same quarter last year and 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. 
We are pleased with the roll-out of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in the EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.2% in local currencies over the same period last year.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% versus 47.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2%. Net sales increased in Brazil by 86.1% in dollars and 88.2% in local currency, largely due to the continued performance of Monster Energy drinks. Net sales in Chile increased 27.9% in dollars and 20% in local currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $511.4 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $585.2 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $33.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased to $525.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.1 days, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $268.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 71.7 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffe Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in 3 flavors, relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in 2 flavors, and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our 2 Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with 3 new flavors. In Canada, in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in 3 flavors as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans. In EMEA, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we will launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea along with Cuba Libre in Japan. We launched the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. 
We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April 2017. On a foreign exchange-adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 is not being included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example: selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives; as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day, the Midwest premium, freight, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India. And so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many noncontrollable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis."

I mean, a number of companies in the industry are facing, what I call, cyclical gross margin issues with aluminum, lags in increasing prices.

I mean, in China, your prices are much lower. So I don't know if it's possible but if you could just help us understand, in terms of these declining gross margins we are seeing, how much would we consider cyclical and how much will be secular. And the second question which is related to this, other companies, like say, Blue Buffalo, their gross margin story would be that they would bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean, as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there opportunity there to also shift production or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one, on the same topic..."

Guy, we spoke about one question at a time, okay. So let's just -- let me just start with production. All of our products are Coke-packed. We have a finished product model. That's not going to change. What will change is, as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing cost, of reducing freight, reducing import duties. And so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Where there are some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them, for example, a 24-ounce cap can in -- for NOS in the U.S., we're then off-selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously, in one case, selling concentrate at a higher margin; and the other case, we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin because -- just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer products like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee products because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster but we are looking to convert that to a local production, which will -- again, which will assist in cost. And as we start ramping up with Caffe Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We are looking to, in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming onboard, which will reduce costs. Could you take the first question, Hilton?"

No, we're continuing with our product strategy, which was to remain competitive with Red Bull Gold, the Thai Red Bull. So that strategy is continuing. Our strategy is to maintain our products adjacent to Red Bull and to have what we call 3P execution, which is pricing competitive with Red Bull, point of sale, and position on shelf. So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good, sustainable sales. And our bottlers, I've just come back from China, have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded, and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is. So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with called Battlegrounds, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year. So we always said that China would be a long-term development, and we're just staying the course."

And that continues to be an ongoing challenge. We have seconded some of our key staff from the U.S. to really educate them and actually be able to really direct them and show them what we need to do. And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder and harder road. And it will be achieved, but we -- and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, we talked about the younger and more affluent. It's really -- it isn't been a change. In China, we have -- our product is carbonated. We -- our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product, Thai Red Bull, in China. And we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world but -- and it is aligned with Red Bull China, but that is at a premium to other -- some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that's just -- we'll continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just to gain -- getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to -- or the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and obviously taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiarized through the local social media companies that have equivalent channels and programs in China."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales; whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.
In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of forex currency movements. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6%, as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to: increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix. Our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix, principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain input costs, principally freight in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA; and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter, as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5%, compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3%, as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter, as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter, as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons, as well as due to inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million in -- for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributor terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after tax. 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we've now fully transitioned to the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets.
During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution of sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year. 
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull were up 2.6%, Rockstar was down 5.6%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 21.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3 points over the same period last year to 37.8%. NOS' share remained the same at 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1 point to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.8 of a point to 7.1%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 point to -- at 6.7%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.3 of a point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 19.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were 26.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 6.2% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which we define as including Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 56.6%, up 11.7 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended March 31, 2018, was 47.6%, up 2.6 points; while Starbucks Double Shot's energy share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points.
The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off that occasion by the end of that quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS' sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle sales increased 22%, and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 point to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 point to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9%, and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7%, and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium; from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic; from 23.7% to 27.1% in France; from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain; from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece; from 10% to 14.1% in Italy; from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands; from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway; from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland; from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain; and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending February 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, increased from 10.3% to 13.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 16% in Germany, and from 16.8% to 15.3% in South Africa, although sales were up in both countries. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2018, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 28.4% to 34.4%, compared to the same period last year; and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of March 2018 increased from 7.4% to 14.9%, as compared to the same period last year.

According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ended March 18, 2018, grew from 5.7% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 45.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.7% from $668.6 million to $780.5 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 17.3%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.4 million of foreign currency movements. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $65.8 million for the first quarter, as compared to $68 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.6%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $2.3 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the first quarter, as compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter last year.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $17.7 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 30.5% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 37.2% in net sales and 23.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 44.5%, compared to 50.3% in the same quarter last year and 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. 
We are pleased with the roll-out of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in the EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 21.3% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% versus 47.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 54.6%, or 49.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In South Korea, net sales increased 22.9%, or 13.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 5.5%, or 1% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the first quarter increased 37.7% in dollars and 34.5% in local currencies over the same period last year.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 48.8% over the same period last year and 47.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2%. Net sales increased in Brazil by 86.1% in dollars and 88.2% in local currency, largely due to the continued performance of Monster Energy drinks. Net sales in Chile increased 27.9% in dollars and 20% in local currency.

We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April 2017. On a foreign exchange-adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 is not being included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example: selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives; as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day, the Midwest premium, freight, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India. And so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many noncontrollable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis."

So I don't know if it's possible but if you could just help us understand, in terms of these declining gross margins we are seeing, how much would we consider cyclical and how much will be secular. And the second question which is related to this, other companies, like say, Blue Buffalo, their gross margin story would be that they would bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean, as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there opportunity there to also shift production or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one, on the same topic..."

Guy, we spoke about one question at a time, okay. So let's just -- let me just start with production. All of our products are Coke-packed. We have a finished product model. That's not going to change. What will change is, as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing cost, of reducing freight, reducing import duties. And so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Where there are some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them, for example, a 24-ounce cap can in -- for NOS in the U.S., we're then off-selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously, in one case, selling concentrate at a higher margin; and the other case, we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin because -- just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer products like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee products because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster but we are looking to convert that to a local production, which will -- again, which will assist in cost. And as we start ramping up with Caffe Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We are looking to, in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming onboard, which will reduce costs. Could you take the first question, Hilton?"

So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good, sustainable sales. And our bottlers, I've just come back from China, have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded, and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is. So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with called Battlegrounds, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year.

And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder and harder road. And it will be achieved, but we -- and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, we talked about the younger and more affluent. It's really -- it isn't been a change. In China, we have -- our product is carbonated. We -- our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product, Thai Red Bull, in China. And we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world but -- and it is aligned with Red Bull China, but that is at a premium to other -- some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that's just -- we'll continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just to gain -- getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to -- or the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and obviously taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiarized through the local social media companies that have equivalent channels and programs in China."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to the Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which the Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction in net sales of, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter, was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional analysis as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; increases in a certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs; domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were at 10.7%, as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter, as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters in litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter, as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to the establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch, and in connection with the current rollout as well as the inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.

It will help us with a get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we referred to in earlier calls is being hard-pressed to have a smaller size can and get recognized with a single can in stores and particularly, in Coke coolers with some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we are pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build but ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well.

Remember, on our previous call, I spoke about it, personal view about margins, when I talk about it personality. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then, and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606, and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind within -- is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those 2 factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotion that is a fact and yes, promotion allowances and one of the big reasons for that is increased shale costs and placement fee. There is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell our products such as the coffee products, Muscle Monster, Caffe Monster that are lower than the Monster products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins not as high as the U.S. margin. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure."

And Monster is continuing to grow and the Strategic Brand, so that continues to put some pressure on the margin as well. So you take all those 3 factors on product mix, geographic mix and mix between the actual product of the Monster versus strategic brands, that has had that effect."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to the Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which the Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter, was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotion allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in a certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7%, as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter, as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters in litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter, as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch, and in connection with the current rollout as well as the inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we've transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018.
In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019, as an affordable energy brand in select Eastern European and African markets.
During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay, and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities, principally in the South and West regions of India. We plan to complete the national rollout in India by year-end.
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia, with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.

NOS's share declined 0.1 share point to 4%, and Full Throttle share declined 0.1 share point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.5 of a point to 35.3%. Rockstar share was down 1.1 points to 6.7%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.4%. And Amp share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.8%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended June 30, 2018, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 22.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 25.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 3.9% lower.

Java Monster share alone for the 5 weeks ended June 30, 2018, was 45.3%, up 1.3 points, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.8%, down 11.9 points.

Monster's sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1 share point so 32.3%. NOS's sales decreased 15%, and its market share decreased 0.8 share points to 2.7%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 20.6% during the month of June 2018. Monster sales increased 28.3%. Our market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.2%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 31.1%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 2%, and its market share decreased by 2.2 points to 9.5%. Vive 100 sales increased 14.6%, and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2018, Monster's retail market share in value grew -- as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.5% to 12.2% in Belgium; from 15.2% to 16.8% in Germany; from 17.2% to 19.6% in Great Britain; from 5.7% to 7.2% in The Netherlands; and from 27.1% to 29.1% in Spain.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 43.4% to 48.7% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these months.
Net sales for the month in the energy drink segment for the second quarter of 2018 increased 14% from $815.3 million to $929.4 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the month in drinks energy segment in the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $5.1 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

In Canada, in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310 ml can, and the collector's edition of Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in the 473 ml can.

Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in France and [ PPM 0 ] in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Kiwi -- Apple Kiwi in Great Britain.

In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018, for Monster and January 1, 2019, for NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate the July 2018 growth sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On our foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had 1 extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution, again, that sales have a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally on -- for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even 2 months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share for a total of $553.2 million, excluding growth of commissions.

On August 7, 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company's continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate our -- the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
And I'd like -- now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

With regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities, there was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through and our distributors to work through because we didn't -- in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done it under the cap promotion, the summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers focused on the modern trade in the main, in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So that's -- it's a slow build, it's steady, we are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly, it won't be through -- in all the businesses units initially. It will be the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line, and then a -- with an additional launch next summer, early in 2019, we believe this is -- it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It will help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller-sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly, in Coke coolers with the -- some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well. And as we said, the new products, we've done some initial taste test of them, they've been very well received, so we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and then the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China."

So that's the first question on gross margin.

So the margin adjusting for those 2 factors alone was up just above 62%. So while we talk about promotion allowances and that is a fact, and yes, promotion allowances are up and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. The -- there is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell our products such as the coffee products, Muscle Monster, Caffe Monster that are lower than the Monster cold pool of products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure."

The follow-up on the pricing is just to what extent will the pricing that you announced cover the input cost inflation that you're seeing? Is it adequate to cover all of it? Is it a large portion of it? So commentary there would be helpful. And then help in just building on some of like the loose guidance or your personal view before with the 62%, we've seen this with a presence of negative geographic mix, promotion, et cetera. So in theory, while those things will still be present to some degree, pricing has not been, obviously, so should we be thinking about something a little bit better than that 62% as we get into Q4 then looking out the next year? And then, Rodney, a broader question on India, maybe talk a little bit about sort of early indications there and how you're defining success in that market?"

There is a recognition of the brand from when we were there many years before when we did some rollout, and we had -- we were in India. We had a very limited presence, but the brand was there, so we are seeing some recognition of the brand, which is good, sort of very different to China where we really, obviously, had no brand recognition while we've launched. So it is different, and we are. But it really is premature. Hilton and I are both planning to be in the -- to go to India and review the markets and launches ourselves personally within the next few months, but we -- at this point, it just is premature for us to comment on really what is happening there and how is it -- how it's going.

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to the Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which the Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter, was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in a certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost -- contract rates in the U.S.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7%, as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter, as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter, as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch, and in connection with the current rollout as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we've transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018.
In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019, as an affordable energy brand in select Eastern European and African markets.
During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay, and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities, principally in the South and West regions of India. We plan to complete the national rollout in India by year-end.
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia, with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.

According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended June 30, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 10.5% over the same period last year.

NOS's share declined 0.1 share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share declined 0.1 share point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.5 of a point to 35.3%. Rockstar share was down 1.1 points to 6.7%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.4%. And Amp share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.8%.

Sales of our Java Monster alone were 25.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 3.9% lower.

Monster's sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1 share point so 32.3%. NOS's sales decreased 15%, and its market share decreased 0.8 share points to 2.7%.

Our market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.2%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 31.1%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.5%.

Vive 100 sales increased 14.6%, and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.5% to 12.2% in Belgium; from 15.2% to 16.8% in Germany; from 17.2% to 19.6% in Great Britain; from 5.7% to 7.2% in The Netherlands; and from 27.1% to 29.1% in Spain.

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 21.4% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies over the same period last year.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.5% for the second quarter.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $211.1 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments.

Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink, exclusively with a large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive.
In Canada, in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310 ml can, and a collector's edition Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473 ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June, and we'll roll it out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018.
Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in France and BPM Zero in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Kiwi -- Apple Kiwi in Great Britain. We also recently launched Mutant, an -- as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia.
In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018, for Monster and January 1, 2019, for NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had 1 extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution, again, that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally on -- for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even 2 months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share for a total of $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On August 7, 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company has continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate our -- the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
And I'd like -- now I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

With regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities, there was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through and our distributors to work through because we didn't -- in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done an under-the-cap promotion, this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers, focused on the modern trade in the main, in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So that's -- it's a slow build, it's steady, we are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly, it won't be through -- in all the businesses units initially. It will be the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line, and then a -- with an additional launch next summer, early in 2019, we believe this is -- it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It will help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller-sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly, in Coke coolers with the -- some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well. And as we said, the new products, we've done some initial taste tests of them, they've been very well received, so we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and then the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China."

Because, I guess, when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the java promotional dollars to -- as you were getting it back on the shelf. So that's the first question on gross margin.

Remember, on the previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins, what I felt about it personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then, and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606 and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within -- is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those 2 factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional allowances and that is a fact, and yes, promotional allowances are up and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. The -- there is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee products, Muscle Monster, Caffé Monster that are lower than the Monster [ cold store ] products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure."

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to the Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which the Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter, was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in a certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost -- contract rates in the U.S.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7%, as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter, as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter.
In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter, as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch, and in connection with the current rollout as well as inventory reserves.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we've transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018.
In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019, as an affordable energy brand in select Eastern European and African markets.
During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay, and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities, principally in the South and West regions of India. We plan to complete the national rollout in India by year-end.
Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia, with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.

Sales of our Java Monster alone were 25.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 3.9% lower.

According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 23, 2018, the energy drink category increased 9% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1 share point so 32.3%. NOS's sales decreased 15%, and its market share decreased 0.8 share points to 2.7%.

Our market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.2%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 31.1%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.5%.

Vive 100 sales increased 14.6%, and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $211.1 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments.

Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink, exclusively with a large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive.
In Canada, in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310 ml can, and a collector's edition Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473 ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June, and we'll roll it out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018.
Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in France and BPM Zero in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Kiwi -- Apple Kiwi in Great Britain. We also recently launched Mutant, an -- as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia.
In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018, for Monster and January 1, 2019, for NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had 1 extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution, again, that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally on -- for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even 2 months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share for a total of $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On August 7, 2018, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company has continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate our -- the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
And I'd like -- now I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

With regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities, there was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through and our distributors to work through because we didn't -- in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done an under-the-cap promotion, this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers, focused on the modern trade in the main, in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So that's -- it's a slow build, it's steady, we are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly, it won't be through -- in all the businesses units initially. It will be the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line, and then a -- with an additional launch next summer, early in 2019, we believe this is -- it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It will help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller-sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly, in Coke coolers with the -- some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well. And as we said, the new products, we've done some initial taste tests of them, they've been very well received, so we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and then the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China."

On modeling, can you just -- I know you don't want to give guidance for margins, et cetera, but just to help us think about it going forward, can you just rank order the factors weighing on gross margins, kind of most impactful to less -- to least, just to give us a better understanding. Because, I guess, when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the java promotional dollars to -- as you were getting it back on the shelf. So that's the first question on gross margin. And then the second, the bigger picture question is, at the shareholder meeting, you talked about talking to the Coca-Cola Company about Mutant and potentially, a new arrangement around that brand, and I just wanted to know if there's any progress there."

Remember, on the previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins, what I felt about it personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then, and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606 and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within -- is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those 2 factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional allowances and that is a fact, and yes, promotional allowances are up and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. The -- there is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee products, Muscle Monster, Caffé Monster that are lower than the Monster [ cold store ] products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure."

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company, based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freighting and other input costs, the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributed termination expenses in both quarters, the general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.
Legal expenses related to regulatory methods and litigation concerning the advertising, maxing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributed termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter, and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores.
In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers.
This concludes the distributed proposition in the United States. In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019, in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.
Last week we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets.
During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continue the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We've now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address 1 aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company Coca-Cola and certain affiliates, restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the Energy Drink category with certain exemptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. While mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.
Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium; from 22.8% to 23.3% in France; from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain; from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands; from 15.3% to 18% in Norway; from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain; and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out of stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 30.9% in the same quarter last year.
Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606 were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%.

In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.

Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Nitro Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics.
In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate that our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advanced purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks.
We estimate that our October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advanced purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which are unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately 696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches.
We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks for the Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

There is, if you look at the agreement, which is, because there are certain ingredients that are if you use in combination, obviously, then, create a definition -- there is a definition of what an energy drink is. The exception goes back to the Coca-Cola brand, not Sprite, not Kickstart, not any other brand, it's the Coca-Cola brand. And if that -- and there are also good exceptions about what because the Coke brand has certain -- other brand would have certain limitations and there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do. Under that brand, again, if it is just a question of adding vitamins well, then Coke, will obviously add vitamins, there isn't an issue with that. But where the brand become -- transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception. And under the Coke brand, that is really where we are. I think there's not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up, if you really have that interest. But we're dealing with it with Coke and I think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and how it should be implemented."

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs, the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, domestic product sales mix and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.  Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch [ distributor proposition ] in the United States. 
In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.  Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. Upon mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.  Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7%, and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%. Rockstar was down 12%. 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 1.0 point to 33.7%. Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 point to 0.7%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy's share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10%, and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7%, and its market share increased 0.5 point to 37.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.9%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9%, and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100's sales increased 27.6%, and its market share decreased 0.9 point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic, from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany, from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece, from 13.2% to 17% in Italy and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending August, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.4% to 14.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 15.3% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period.
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9% as compared to the same period last year.
We launched in Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year.

Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 9.7% to 8.8%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5.7%.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.  Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. 
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales -- net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. 
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter largely due to supply issues.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018.
Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink and also relaunched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster [ Mix ] Punch in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany."

Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia, with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

But where the brand transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception.

So we have that significant cost increases in that regard as well. So we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum, and I'm not seeing further increases in freight. However, anything is possible. Having said that, we will have a price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year. So it's kind of a mixed bag with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. But I hope that answers your question."

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs, the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, domestic product sales mix and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.  Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributed transition in the United States. 
In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.  Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. Upon mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.  Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7%, and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%. Rockstar was down 12%. 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 1.0 point to 33.7%. Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 point to 0.7%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy's share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 share point to 3%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9%, and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100's sales increased 27.6%, and its market share decreased 0.9 point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic, from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany, from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece, from 13.2% to 17% in Italy and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.

According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.  Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. 
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales -- net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. 
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter largely due to supply issues.

In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas ret",575,"Sorry, PET bottles in Austria and Monster Mango Loco in Germany, sorry. Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia, with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do. Under that brand, again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception. And under the Coke brand, that is really where we are. I think there's not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time.

Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.
There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.  Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributors transition in the United States. 
In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.  Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. Upon mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.  Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7%, and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%. Rockstar was down 12%. 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 1.0 point to 33.7%. Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy's share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10%, and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7%, and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9%, and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100's sales increased 27.6%, and its market share decreased 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic, from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany, from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece, from 13.2% to 17% in Italy and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.

According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year.

According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year.

According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.  Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. 
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales -- net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. 
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter largely due to supply issues.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018.
Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink and also relaunched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster MIXXD Punch in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia (sic) [ Austria ]; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany."

Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia, with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the third quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

I guess I'm just wondering if this is limited to certain countries or if this is really a broader regional issue and whether this is being addressed as we speak, so we get more of a bump-up in sales in the fourth quarter. It seems like we've been having some of these supply chain issues in international markets time to time, so how do we think about, really, more fully addressing the issue broadly?"

There is -- Coke, obviously looking at their own portfolio and looking for where they believe they see opportunities and where their own BUs would look to expand their own portfolio. As we indicated in the call, there is an exception for certain products that are in the Coca-Cola brand. And that is, in and of itself, an area that we're looking at. We have a difference of opinion on it. We don't know -- at this point, we don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on, if that comes to fruition, what effect that might or might not have on our brand. I mean, we continue to be partners with Coca-Cola and with the Bottlers. We continue to have our full range sold by them. And we just don't think that at this point, we would be in a position -- or should be in a position to speculate on what effect that might have. It would just be another product being sold by Coca-Cola Bottlers, but the impact and effect on us would be something, I think, wouldn't be appropriate for us to deal with.

But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do. Under that brand, again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception.

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.  Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributors transition in the United States. 
In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.  Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. Upon mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.  Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7%, and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%. Rockstar was down 12%. 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 1.0 point to 33.7%. Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy's share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10%, and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7%, and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9%, and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100's sales increased 27.6%, and its market share decreased 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic, from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany, from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece, from 13.2% to 17% in Italy and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.

For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 15.3% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period.
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9% as compared to the same period last year.
We launched in Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.  Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. 
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales -- net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. 
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter largely due to supply issues.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018.
Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink and also relaunched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster MIXXD Punch in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia (sic) [ Austria ]; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany."

Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia, with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the third quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And then we have -- obviously, we have additional SKUs with the original Green Monster. So the core brand is continuing to grow. There has been the entry into the market of additional products, primarily probably in what we would maybe call or describe as a performance energy category or a workout fitness energy category or not even really maybe in that category. And they have -- there is some sales on that. There were a number of reasons that those products are sort of starting to gain some traction. But if I look at the sales levels they are still behind the increase in sales. So I think overall, we are getting additional products in the category, but the category itself is continuing to grow."

And if that -- and there are certain exceptions about what -- because the Coke brand has certain -- otherwise, there would be certain limitations, and there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do. Under that brand, again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception. And under the Coke brand, that is really where we are. I think there's not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really have that interest. But we're dealing with it with Coke, and we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and what it -- and how it should be implemented."

I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum, and I'm not seeing further increases in freight. However, anything is possible. Having said that, we will have a price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year.

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Gross and net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8% compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix and geographical gross profit mix.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.  Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.
Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributors transition in the United States. 
In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.  Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.
Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed 2 energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. Upon mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018.  Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7%, and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%. Rockstar was down 12%. 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 1.0 point to 33.7%. Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%.
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the 5 weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy's share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10%, and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7%, and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.9%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9%, and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100's sales increased 27.6%, and its market share decreased 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value compared to the same period last year grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic, from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany, from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece, from 13.2% to 17% in Italy and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending August, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.4% to 14.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 15.3% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period.
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9% as compared to the same period last year.
We launched in Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year.
According to IRI, in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending September 30, 2018, increased from 6.4% to 6.8% as compared to the same period last year. Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 9.7% to 8.8%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5.7%.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.  Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues.
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year.  Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. 
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales -- net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. 
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter largely due to supply issues.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018.
Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink and also relaunched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster MIXXD Punch in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia (sic) [ Austria ]; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany."

Thank you. 
In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia, with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019.
In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the third quarter and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus Strategic Brand in New Zealand to Lift Plus with 3 SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.
We estimate our October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days; days of the week in which holidays fall; timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And if that -- and there are certain exceptions about what -- because the Coke brand has certain -- otherwise, there would be certain limitations, and there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do. Under that brand, again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we perceive positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception. And under the Coke brand, that is really where we are. I think there's not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really have that interest. But we're dealing with it with Coke, and we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and what it -- and how it should be implemented."

Trying to understand, as we look -- will this more than offset -- I mean, can you hold gross margins relatively flat going forward? And when I say that, have we seen the full impact of costs in the third quarter? Or do you still have another kind of layer or step up of cost input inflation that kicks in, in fourth quarter and 2019?"

So we've had this increase in tariff, which has resulted in increase of aluminum, which is slowly coming off, right? It's not -- it's a slow, very slow process. So we've also had extreme increases in freight-in costs that -- we account for cost of sales, where product is moved to our co-packers or moved to our warehouses. That's all included in cost of sales. So we have that significant cost increases in that regard as well. So we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum, and I'm not seeing further increases in freight. However, anything is possible. Having said that, we will have a price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year. So it's kind of a mixed bag with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. But I hope that answers your question."
